1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
okay welcome to the end of Thursday if

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:05,940
you want to get me really annoyed you

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,259
should refer to this conference as the

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,320
antivirus conference because I really

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,540
think it isn't but at the same time the

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,639
fact is a lot of people here work for

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,619
antivirus vendors or endpoint security

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,050
vendors and I think this is and a little

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,550
in this landscape a lot of things are

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,140
changing so I think it's important to

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,460
have a discussion about these changes

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,730
and I'm very excited to introduce Adrian

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,460
Sanabria from 4-5-1 research to talk

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,210
about you things thank you thank you and

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,239
you you do have virus in the name of the

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,420
conference so that's you can't get too

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,840
upset I don't think all right thank you

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,899
for coming in today

19
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,629
late on the second day of a conference

20
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,640
I've been on the last day of the

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,980
conference the last presentation and

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,230
that's that's not the best best time to

23
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,459
be there but yes so I actually emailed

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:06,720
sint maarten in email and you know asked

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,580
about you know if the this industry

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,960
would be interested in doing something

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,909
you know I think we we tend to stay

28
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,210
within our bubbles too much you know and

29
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,979
and while some issues it is important to

30
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,960
stay close to them I've always been a

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,689
big-picture guy and that's one of the

32
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,880
reasons I love being an industry analyst

33
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,590
it allows me to spend all day thinking

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,130
way too much about all these topics and

35
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,880
how they fit into the other topics and

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,170
and that's why I want to share with you

37
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,030
today

38
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,860
so just to give you a background I don't

39
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,570
know about the average industry analyst

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,090
but I've been on the defense side I've

41
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,610
been on the offense side I've been a PCI

42
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,820
qsa I've been they spent five years of

43
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,670
my career as a chief incident handler I

44
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,950
was an IT before that so I've been a

45
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,759
sysadmin I've done architecture you know

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,920
generally I jump it pretty much

47
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,299
everything in anything I can get my

48
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,600
hands on so we're gonna start out with

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,109
the big picture

50
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:14,930
so it's a and this is typical of

51
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,910
security security is a second layer on

52
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,830
top of technology and everything else

53
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,690
and it's just the nature of security and

54
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,580
I don't think the financial markets have

55
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,500
understood this yet have gotten this yet

56
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,930
you know if you look at fireeyes stock

57
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,080
prices and things like that disruption

58
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,630
has to occur you know a lot of times we

59
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,010
don't know that we've picked the wrong

60
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,560
route or the wrong technology until

61
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,510
we're several years down it you know the

62
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,240
startups have been built sold you know

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,720
the money's been pumped into it and and

64
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,310
sometimes just the landscape changes

65
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,770
it's not that we made a mistake it's

66
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,930
just that things change technologies new

67
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,020
technologies come out and old strategies

68
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,960
don't work anymore so a lot has changed

69
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,210
and I think one of the most important

70
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,480
things I'd say - two very important

71
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,820
things have changed here the user and

72
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,050
how they use technology and the

73
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,480
technology itself has changed and the

74
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,500
attacker has changed significantly so I

75
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,090
think there's a lot of gaps here and I'm

76
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,830
going to get into these more I don't

77
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,360
want to spend too long on these on these

78
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,340
overview slides but if you were to you

79
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,800
know step out of the room right now you

80
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,630
know I think that this gets across some

81
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,820
of the the key concepts and ideas I'm

82
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,850
trying to get across here we often

83
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,590
there's a lot of key things we don't

84
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,600
think about when we build security

85
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,510
solutions we don't think about the user

86
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,060
we don't think about where it's going to

87
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,520
be used where that users going to be and

88
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,660
how they're going to use it and then we

89
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,360
don't think from the attacker

90
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,580
perspective well enough I think I think

91
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,590
we it's too easily and I don't have that

92
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,620
xkcd comic in here but the you know the

93
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,410
Hollywood versus the the real life you

94
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,300
know in Hollywood you know there's some

95
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,540
very creative and and sexy ways that you

96
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,350
can break into systems and then there's

97
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,220
you know you look at the attacker

98
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,310
mindset and they want the paycheck as

99
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,790
easily and quickly as possible you know

100
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,040
they're not going to go for the the

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,440
coolest story to tell over beers they're

102
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,350
gonna go for money in their account so

103
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,020
the market view here it's very difficult

104
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,200
to even as an industry analyst to keep

105
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,630
up with it

106
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,330
so backing up if we look at the history

107
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,230
of endpoint security here AV was was

108
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,440
kind of the the key product in 2002 and

109
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,570
before and then we started to see a

110
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,820
branch out and we saw a lot of

111
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,979
additional technologies in it they don't

112
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:04,490
even fit in in the bubble here but we

113
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,790
just saw and this is a classic security

114
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,280
startup market this is a classic

115
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,580
security cycle where it just breaks out

116
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,540
like this and even today you know I

117
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,450
think a lot of people don't recall that

118
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,100
money was actually spent on host-based

119
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,229
firewalls because windows didn't have

120
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,120
one Mac didn't have one you know they

121
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,560
weren't built in if you wanted a

122
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,169
firewall on the OS you had to buy it you

123
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,919
know because it was you know it hadn't

124
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,830
become ordinary for laptops to leave the

125
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,610
enterprise for most of the employees to

126
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,880
take a corporate device and plug it in

127
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,200
places that weren't trusted and networks

128
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,610
that weren't trusted we didn't need a

129
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,940
firewall there so a lot of these got

130
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,370
consolidated then we ended up with

131
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,750
something we called endpoint protection

132
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,050
then in 2010 we saw some significant

133
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,910
changes in the attacker it's not that

134
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,729
the attacker changed in 2010 said we

135
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:07,070
became aware of the landscape change in

136
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,389
2010 so again we had this explosion you

137
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:13,520
know a V wasn't stopping a lot of the

138
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,660
stuff and and we just had other needs

139
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,210
you know the the ways the attacks change

140
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,479
required us to defend differently back

141
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:27,350
in 2004 I was responsible for my company

142
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,780
sim and one of the things I looked at

143
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,930
doing was just taking the windows logs

144
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,330
from all the workstations and putting

145
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,760
them

146
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,430
to that sim and of course we were I was

147
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,530
a large payment processor so we had to

148
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,040
comply with PCI and that that means

149
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,500
keeping your data for a year is one of

150
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,350
the requirements and just putting the

151
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,090
windows logs you know not even what

152
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,370
crowd striking carbon black and these

153
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,380
guys are talking about doing today you

154
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,030
know taking every network connection

155
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,180
every file change what's access to file

156
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,690
you know process tree in memory you know

157
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,850
this was just windows logs I would have

158
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,520
had three weeks of storage after pulling

159
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,360
them all in there so that changed it was

160
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,750
able to change primarily now we have no

161
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,210
SQL we've got Hadoop we've got solid

162
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,420
state based sans things like that the

163
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,960
storage and the data technology enable

164
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,580
us to do that now it didn't ten years

165
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,830
ago we couldn't have done that ten years

166
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,300
ago so again we're we're right there

167
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,520
again we're seeing heavy consolidation

168
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,120
and when I released my report I'll show

169
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,120
you here in a moment the one I wrote

170
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,820
last December I had five categories in

171
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,410
there and I noted in the report that I

172
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,210
fully expect two or three years from now

173
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,640
to only have two categories to go from

174
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,730
five down to two so I don't know what

175
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,310
we'll call the next thing I work at four

176
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,770
or five one I don't work at Gartner

177
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,270
they'll come up with that term we'll all

178
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,430
have to use it but I hope it doesn't

179
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,000
have next generation in it because I

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,300
don't know about you but that terms I

181
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,050
think outlived its usefulness by now

182
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,880
it's a term that expires you know what

183
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,010
do you have after next generation next

184
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,780
next ji mean what do you call it

185
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,210
you know if palo alto firewall was next

186
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,160
generation in 2006 what do you call it

187
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,560
now also a little jab at machine

188
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,820
learning there i think the marketing is

189
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,099
has taken to referring to machine

190
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,559
learning and AI as equivalent things so

191
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,500
i had to take a little jab there another

192
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,610
one of my feeble attempts at humor

193
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,790
the attacker landscape

194
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,370
so this was a 2003 this is my boss when

195
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,690
I joined four or five one I quoted her

196
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,190
saying this I'm not sure if she's happy

197
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,029
with me quoting or saying this but but

198
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:01,820
it's important to understand you know

199
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,709
you know when we were talking about the

200
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:06,480
death of antivirus we're really talking

201
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,830
about the process of doing detection and

202
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,320
doing prevention not the market not

203
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,899
necessarily the products again it's just

204
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,570
this change that we have to make and how

205
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,880
we do this and publicly gotten out there

206
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,990
you know Netflix made some PR statement

207
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,630
about the death of a V I said no just

208
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,399
because we're doing it differently just

209
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,690
because we're stopping malware

210
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,850
differently doesn't mean that it's dead

211
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,620
but you know maybe again they're using

212
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,180
the other definition maybe they're

213
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,580
talking about the fact that the process

214
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,100
has changed so it is all about the

215
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,730
process you know now we live in a world

216
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,279
where malware is completely disposable

217
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,820
there's no reason to use binary

218
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,180
executable file with this particular

219
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,180
hash more than once you know part of the

220
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,520
malware kit is it'll generate something

221
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,560
unique that's guaranteed or literally

222
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,440
your money back to bypass AV and once

223
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,779
you're done with it you dispose of it so

224
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,110
we've had to move on one of the things

225
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,110
that urged me is a lot of companies out

226
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,270
there have advanced products and then

227
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,520
they're non advanced products the way I

228
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,560
look at it is we have things that work

229
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,350
better and things that don't work as

230
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:36,720
well so to me you know somewhat jokingly

231
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,270
asked companies you know are you gonna

232
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,820
charge people for the patch you know for

233
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,279
the upgrade here now because all this is

234
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,529
doing is what the original product was

235
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,079
designed to do so why sell them even as

236
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,660
separate products you know I mean this

237
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,300
this should not be marketed as a premium

238
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,279
product because this is just how it is

239
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:56,730
now

240
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,220
you know the attackers have access to

241
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,720
things we consider advanced

242
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,820
and it's no more difficult for them to

243
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:12,600
use them so they use them so another

244
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,980
term I want us to get out of using these

245
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,900
things that were maybe they were

246
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,240
advanced in 2010 but it's not 2010 so

247
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,100
the first what I call the first great

248
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,490
and point security consolidation started

249
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,620
with zone alarm in 2003 checkpoint

250
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,480
acquiring zone alarm which was a

251
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,630
host-based firewall product I think it

252
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,740
did some additional thing some ids/ips

253
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,200
and roughly I mean it's kind of hard to

254
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
tell exactly where it ends but you know

255
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,290
whitelisting was big and late 2000s and

256
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,850
there were some key acquisitions there

257
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,070
like solid core and then Symantec

258
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,520
acquired PGP which one of the key pieces

259
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,350
of endpoint protection was full disk

260
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,820
encryption this was before we had

261
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,250
BitLocker before Mac had gonna blank on

262
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,200
the name but Windows Mac host firewalls

263
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,050
full disk encryption all these got built

264
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,050
into the OS and really if you look at

265
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,730
this trend what's a feature today Emmit

266
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,130
AppLocker

267
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,680
ends up as part of the OS you know so we

268
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,280
just end up with a more resilient more

269
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,480
security feature complete operating

270
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,690
system as we go down the line here it

271
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,880
makes sense to ship with a lot of these

272
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,240
core key technologies we need to keep

273
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,690
these systems safe so it was about 30

274
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,610
acquisitions over that time period

275
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,690
just for endpoint security and so

276
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,580
several events helped us kick start the

277
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,810
second consolidation which started also

278
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,070
in 2010 i I think whitelisting was a big

279
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,230
one of them I think a lot of people got

280
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,640
keyed up over white listening there are

281
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,320
big marketing campaigns saying that

282
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,200
white listening could replace AV you

283
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,740
know and solve that problem forever and

284
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,770
even technically if it could you know I

285
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,660
think what

286
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,480
a lot of us certainly a lot of the

287
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,199
vendors didn't count on was that again

288
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,670
what I said at the beginning the users

289
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,009
they didn't take the the use cases the

290
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:27,500
workflows into consideration you know

291
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,870
and anybody who tried to do this blanket

292
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,089
wide across the entire operating system

293
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:34,579
all executables all employees in the

294
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,560
organization quickly found out that it

295
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,120
wasn't something that was maintainable

296
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,839
so what happened after 2010 we found out

297
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,600
about some super cool malware

298
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,170
created by governments highly funded

299
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,730
some other state actors Snowden so some

300
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:00,259
NSA tools and toys made it out of the

301
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:03,230
the toy box and into public so all these

302
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,089
things once you use a piece of malware

303
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,269
once somebody spends all this money

304
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:09,949
whether it be state-sponsored or you

305
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,550
know just a single malware author it's

306
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,910
very difficult to use those tools to use

307
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,160
malware to use these whether you want to

308
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,589
call them tools weapons whatever and not

309
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,600
have them get in the hands of people

310
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,110
that will take them build on them and go

311
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,819
from there and then ransomware has been

312
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:34,220
the big one I remember you know decade

313
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,189
before we first saw a ransomware

314
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,449
chatting with people and wondering you

315
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:41,649
know why don't these guys just you know

316
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,850
you know automate something really

317
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,829
destructive you know why don't we see

318
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:48,079
more of that and we have started seeing

319
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,600
that and it really is like when we can

320
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,790
come up with these scenarios you know

321
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,009
it's it's not that it's not attractive

322
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:56,329
to them they just haven't figured out

323
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,110
how to monetize it yet so ransoms

324
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,540
extortion has been going on since we've

325
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,199
had broadband you know since before that

326
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,850
you know related to servers and

327
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,170
computers and things like that

328
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,240
ransomware is just the first time we've

329
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,240
seen somebody come up with a better way

330
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,259
to monetize it and fully automate it so

331
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:21,069
they've scaled it up

332
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,860
right so the second big endpoint

333
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,810
security consolidation a key one we saw

334
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,450
Webroot acquired a company that had some

335
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,660
technology allowed them to do detection

336
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,860
without depending on signatures so that

337
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,260
was a big turning point there we started

338
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,580
seeing more and more of that Google

339
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,010
acquired virustotal Avastin AG AVG was a

340
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,660
was a good one and your joke was

341
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,790
excellent by the way

342
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,650
about the let me know if the the

343
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,330
acquisition helps them with their with

344
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,840
their foosball game or tape you call it

345
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,210
a table soccer table football that's

346
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,510
right only only we call it soccer so

347
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,360
that's 26 acquisitions so far we're

348
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,310
gonna see several more this year before

349
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,010
the years even out and we'll see a lot

350
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,370
next year because we're now up to

351
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,770
something like I think I tracked 77

352
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,620
endpoint security vendors and actually

353
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,870
excludes some things that you might call

354
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,890
endpoint security so here's some

355
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,600
statistics we gather at 451 clearly you

356
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,270
can see here a lot of people are piling

357
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,630
up solutions here they're not using one

358
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,850
endpoint solution here and it's because

359
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,460
of this fragmentation the fact that we

360
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,730
have so many products that do nice

361
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,340
things and also as I mentioned before

362
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,940
the first great security consolidation

363
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,140
you know created this monolithic

364
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,080
endpoint protection client most of the

365
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,090
new guys that are maybe more effective

366
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,220
at catching malware aren't doing any of

367
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,200
those things they're not doing full disk

368
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,900
encryption they're not doing device

369
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,640
ports control over your USB ports

370
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,630
they're not doing all those extra

371
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,720
features so one of many reasons we might

372
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,319
be running more than one of these and we

373
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,730
actually captured some of that here's

374
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,060
some of the things that people that we

375
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,910
survey this is a part of 451 called

376
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,280
voice of the enterprise that surveys I

377
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,589
think for this one it was something like

378
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:33,040
900 buyers in in the enterprise every

379
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,190
quarter

380
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,440
so we get some great data out of there

381
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,010
and you're gonna see more of it

382
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,630
so last December this is what my market

383
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,340
map looked like I broke it out into five

384
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,920
categories and as I promised I've

385
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,440
already consolidated down some from this

386
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,320
but it's extremely difficult I think to

387
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,850
build these categories

388
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,370
I'm confused the buyers confused even

389
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,200
some of the vendors are confused over

390
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,370
how to break up their products how to

391
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,880
sell it who the buyers might be and a

392
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,740
part of my job to guide them on that and

393
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,360
sometimes I have to say you know I'm not

394
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,100
sure you're gonna have to fill this one

395
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,380
out so this was sixty two vendors this

396
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,980
is ten months ago five categories and

397
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,530
now I'm kind of down to three categories

398
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,800
and we're up to 77 vendors and what

399
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,360
we're seeing a lot of is we're seeing a

400
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,860
lot of vendors with some cool tricks you

401
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,260
know but it not much more than a cool

402
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,840
trick to stop malware you know maybe

403
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,510
they a shim rights to the colonel maybe

404
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,750
they they look for certain syscalls or

405
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,550
patterns of Cisco so again they're

406
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,340
shimming the kernel to do that a lot of

407
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,840
people have found these little tricks to

408
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,480
catch malware but there are tricks that

409
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,340
could be evaded and it's not really a

410
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,080
product you know they're gonna try and

411
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,750
sell it as a product but it really

412
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,690
should just be one technique used within

413
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,940
a larger product and again this is this

414
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,180
is normal for security most startups and

415
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,580
security are building features that are

416
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,160
destined to become features in larger

417
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,190
products later on and financially I mean

418
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,110
that that's just that's the way it is

419
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,330
you know you can't boil the ocean when

420
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,580
you're startup and you have limited

421
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,420
funding and capital and access to talent

422
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,340
so we also see a 50/50 split between

423
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,100
complementary and primary and what I

424
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,410
mean there is there are products out

425
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,960
there that are meant to be installed

426
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,480
alongside AV and then there are products

427
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,130
that are meant to replace it or to be

428
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,340
that primary product so that's a 50/50

429
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,200
split right now and that was complete

430
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,680
coincidence that it's exactly 50/50 well

431
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,590
actually it can't be that's I've got 77

432
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,160
vendors

433
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,049
I probably a few of those I'm not sure

434
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,059
I have to do more research they're so

435
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,159
primary we've got pretty much two things

436
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,960
here and and to be a primary vendor

437
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,509
again if I'm a PCI company they've got

438
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:00,610
to be certified AV or Mike USA is gonna

439
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,980
say no that doesn't count as antivirus

440
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,129
you can't use that you know whitelisting

441
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,899
you know it can get past that sometimes

442
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:10,119
but you know really that AV

443
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,009
certification is very important it's

444
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:14,919
it's a it's a water line that they've

445
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,190
got across for legitimacy you know a lot

446
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,480
of these products you know there's no

447
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,009
free trial there's no way to grab it

448
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,619
download it look at it play with it so

449
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,720
we have to depend on some kind of system

450
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,119
here you know to give us some confidence

451
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,580
that this does what it says it can do

452
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,809
and so we're just now starting to see

453
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:37,299
I've got a list of four there you know

454
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:39,879
of these next-gen AV companies that do

455
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:44,769
that so talking about next-gen I don't

456
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:45,999
know what Gardner's definition for

457
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:48,039
next-gen AV is but the way I generally

458
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,989
think of it is we have products that

459
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:52,629
require prior knowledge of a threat to

460
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:54,909
stop that threat and products that don't

461
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:57,549
require prior knowledge to stop a threat

462
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,799
so in my mind that's the clear

463
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:02,019
distinction between the two here

464
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,999
anything I'm going to consider next-gen

465
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:07,539
does not require IOC s or signatures or

466
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:10,720
a malware sandbox to take five minutes

467
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,730
to analyze it

468
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,429
I think static analysis is fine you know

469
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:17,350
because you have to think about the use

470
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,659
cases I think a malware analysis sandbox

471
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:21,940
is fine for email because a five minute

472
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,100
delay an email isn't a big deal but if

473
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,809
I'm browsing the web if I'm downloading

474
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,389
something you know if I've just plugged

475
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:31,090
in a flash drive I mean I can't wait

476
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,580
five minutes you know for a malware

477
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,820
sandbox to run that you know so that

478
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,059
technically to me you know even though

479
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,649
you're the first one potentially to

480
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:44,169
analyze it you're you have to turn that

481
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,869
into yes it's a known threat no it's not

482
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:49,389
a threat before you can take action on

483
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:53,690
it so

484
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,940
prevention and detection the difference

485
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,500
between though these is pretty

486
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,000
significant and I think what the market

487
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,950
is really striving for right now is

488
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,200
prevention and and the big difference

489
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,110
here is prevention just stops malware

490
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,540
from executing end of story you just go

491
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,980
on with your day you don't have to

492
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,660
analyze it you don't have to spend any

493
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,270
time on it product just did its job and

494
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,990
end a story user goes on with their day

495
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,220
if you don't have time you don't have to

496
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,610
look at it whereas on the detection side

497
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,660
it's much more expensive because you

498
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,640
have to launch into your incident

499
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,430
response process and any time you you

500
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,360
have to kick you know security team in

501
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,340
gear you know maybe you want to reimage

502
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,440
that machine after you're done with it a

503
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,080
lot more labor involved with that

504
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,180
workflow you know so big distinction

505
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,340
between the two and most enterprises I

506
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,030
talked to their hair's on fire 24/7 so

507
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,140
they're really looking for the

508
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,720
prevention side of things and once they

509
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,240
get that down once they have less

510
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,410
infections on a regular basis you know

511
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:03,900
and and and they get that tied down i we

512
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,820
definitely have to move in the detection

513
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,500
route because things will get past that

514
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,120
I don't think it's important or even

515
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,110
necessary to go for a hundred percent

516
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,470
prevention you know some point we've got

517
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,440
to have that layer further down to catch

518
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,260
things so data collection that's where

519
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,010
this comes in

520
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,480
we've got all these products that just

521
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,250
gather tons and tons of data from the

522
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,250
endpoint and I think it's I see a lot of

523
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,630
enterprises trying to compare prevention

524
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,060
products and products that just call

525
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,490
this data from endpoints and it's just

526
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,980
it's it's night and day if you've got

527
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,730
infections going on 24/7 you know that

528
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,320
and you're you never come out of

529
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,480
Incident Response mode you don't need

530
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,610
more data at that point to have to comb

531
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,680
through you know that that's not the

532
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,080
right move there and and generally those

533
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,260
those attempts fail because they do not

534
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,790
have the extra people to look through it

535
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,400
to tune it to monitor it to manage it

536
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,320
and that's why we see a lot of managed

537
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,429
services around this now you know the

538
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:10,440
red canary is a company they do nothing

539
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,350
but take your carbon black data and tell

540
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,080
you if something bad is in it that's all

541
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,780
they do they go through all that all

542
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,980
that noise for you and pull out the

543
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,340
signal so another big thing to mention

544
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,830
here a lot of the newer guys don't do a

545
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,590
whole lot with remediation and the term

546
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,160
remediation here I want to be clear on

547
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,660
when I think of remediation I think of

548
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,500
actually cleaning it up you're actually

549
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,450
undoing registry keys that were set you

550
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,720
know pulling files off the system

551
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,520
unregistering dll's whatever the piece

552
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,150
of malware did you're undoing it versus

553
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,890
containment which a lot of people use

554
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,679
the term remediation to refer to as an

555
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:54,000
incident responder what i think of as

556
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,790
containment that's just keeping you know

557
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,010
it from exfiltrating stuff talking to

558
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,500
see to spreading to something else if

559
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,790
it's a worm you know that's just

560
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,179
limiting your damage which is is very

561
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,309
useful in the moment that you detect

562
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:10,770
something you know bad is on your

563
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,890
systems but beyond that you still have

564
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,200
to clean it up eventually and it's very

565
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,530
very expensive as I mentioned to take a

566
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,960
system from somebody pull it back to the

567
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,419
helpdesk copy the data off reimage it

568
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,010
copy the data back on hand it to them

569
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,010
and my estimates it's anywhere from 800

570
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,200
to 2,300 dollars every time you do that

571
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,390
to an employee depending on that

572
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,000
employee salary your security analyst

573
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,950
salary your helpdesk people's salary all

574
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,400
the time necessary and labor necessary

575
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,950
to do that

576
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,679
so the startup cycle switching gears

577
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,299
here a little bit important to

578
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:53,940
understand that at some point here you

579
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,919
know most of these I'd say 95% plus

580
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,570
startups are going to be acquired by

581
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,169
somebody the founders are going to leave

582
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:06,450
at some point you know very important

583
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,309
understand if you're in a start-up

584
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:10,410
dealing with the startup using a

585
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,260
startups product and because it can be

586
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,780
disruptive to the customer you know some

587
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,309
customers prefer to wait for the

588
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,190
consolidation to happen you know other

589
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:20,970
companies you

590
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,430
like you see Netflix will try one of

591
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,350
everything you know anything new that

592
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,790
comes out they actually have the

593
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,280
bandwidth to try some of it and they'll

594
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,140
give good feedback and it's it's good

595
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,140
for the startup community and general

596
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,060
it's a three to five year cycle is what

597
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,700
we see in security from the start of a

598
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,340
market to most of the consolidation

599
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,840
having happened so here's my roadmap for

600
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,110
security and honestly this actually

601
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,610
might be a good place to stop because

602
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,770
I've got a ton more slides but it's

603
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,200
really mostly an angry rant for me so

604
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,730
maybe I can just I can give the other

605
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,410
part of the presentation and a bar later

606
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,200
but this is kind of the key here so this

607
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,550
is you know I promised five years out

608
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,420
this is really and I formed this over

609
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,220
you know several several years doing

610
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,700
this well we're really my whole career

611
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,790
just thinking about it so all of this is

612
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,530
happening right now this is not going to

613
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,710
happen linearly in this order companies

614
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,230
are every single one of these steps is

615
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,730
happening now but I put this in this

616
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,200
order because I think this is the order

617
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,240
that makes the most sense for the

618
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,670
average enterprise out there right now

619
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,830
what their capabilities are you know

620
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,090
what they have available and like I said

621
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:44,580
before it doesn't make sense you know to

622
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,450
get terabytes of new data every week you

623
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,760
know when you're just trying to handle

624
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,190
stop the infections so the better

625
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,080
malware mousetrap is definitely what we

626
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,950
see most of those 77 vendors doing and

627
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,140
really really focused on and just a

628
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,000
broad number of different ways to

629
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,910
accomplish that AV certification is

630
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,760
obviously important for the market

631
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,090
because a lot of people can't buy it you

632
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,050
know that they're not going to be able

633
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,880
to use it unless that certification is

634
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,600
their you know standards regulation

635
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,360
stuff like that requires it to be

636
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,770
something that's that's had some kind of

637
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,660
due diligence third-party due diligence

638
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,750
done on it non malware attacks we could

639
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,690
solve malware today be done with it have

640
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,720
a 100% solution for it and attackers

641
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,840
will still get on

642
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,269
you know so we we clearly have other

643
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:39,759
issues we have to do there you know

644
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,909
somebody earlier was talking about they

645
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:46,629
call it CFO fraud yeah I guess a new

646
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:49,570
term but the idea that you know if I'm

647
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,759
an attacker and I want you know there

648
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,429
was the case in Austria where the think

649
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:57,509
it was an airplane parts manufacturer

650
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:00,730
attacker just sent the CFO an email

651
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,220
requesting forty five million euro to be

652
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,539
moved from this bank account to this

653
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:06,519
bank account and he did it there is no

654
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,769
link there was no attachment there's no

655
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:12,789
exploit it was just 100% social

656
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:15,399
engineering you know and really that you

657
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:17,169
have to get down into thinking about the

658
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:19,899
entire workflow of how we use computers

659
00:29:19,899 --> 00:29:22,869
email things like that because

660
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,600
transferring forty five million euro is

661
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,269
not a workflow that should exist in a

662
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:31,629
company of excise within email there

663
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:33,220
should be some other system some other

664
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,799
workflow for that an email gets abuse

665
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:36,700
for that kind of thing

666
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,860
so it's a you know for a defender that's

667
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,490
a different way of thinking about things

668
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,779
then of course the endpoint protection

669
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:46,480
features there's a lot more we need on

670
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,529
the endpoint than just malware or even

671
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:54,759
just attack prevention you know so these

672
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,019
features are going to have to make it

673
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:57,940
into whatever product we end up getting

674
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,470
using or using and I think eventually

675
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,019
we'll see a shift where the enterprise

676
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:07,419
is not comfortable with having two or

677
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:10,389
three vendors you know separate invoices

678
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:12,809
for each product separate separate

679
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:15,759
control management consoles for each

680
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,309
product they're only going to deal with

681
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:21,340
that temporarily so we're going to have

682
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,499
to see that consolidate and then data

683
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:26,230
visibility I think this one is huge and

684
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,879
it's been avoided because it's a very

685
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:34,619
very hard problem we have a lot of

686
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:37,330
products that can tell us if an

687
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,169
infection occurred but very few those

688
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:43,710
products can tell us what was taken and

689
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,909
it's incredibly important because

690
00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:48,429
generally you know if that

691
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:51,129
happens the default for a company is to

692
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:53,919
assume the worst and so they buy all

693
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,929
their customers identity theft

694
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:59,440
protection you know they assume all 7

695
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,809
million records were lost but if we had

696
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:03,129
a product that could tell us exactly

697
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,440
what was taken if anything was

698
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,929
successfully exfiltrated you know maybe

699
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:10,960
it was only seven thousand records or

700
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,869
seven records or no records and we don't

701
00:31:13,869 --> 00:31:16,899
have to enact the the breach protocol at

702
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:18,549
all we don't have to go through that

703
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:19,840
work workflow at all

704
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,820
and I think that's going to be very very

705
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:26,169
attractive to companies and ultimately I

706
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:28,720
think the direction we need to move in

707
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,830
is aiming to not need a separate product

708
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,980
in a first place we saw that with a lot

709
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,360
of these features with host firewall

710
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,059
full disk encryption I don't have to buy

711
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:44,409
a third party product to do that Android

712
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:47,019
iOS you know the average person I think

713
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:49,210
does completely fine on those platforms

714
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:53,019
even Mac without antivirus you know

715
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:54,940
generally if you make a few precautions

716
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:59,080
you know you don't have to do it so you

717
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,369
know Windows is kind of the special

718
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:02,970
child here because there's so many

719
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,519
legacy requirements so many components

720
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:09,519
and I think there are signs that we're

721
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,039
getting there though recently they

722
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,929
opened up their App Store which I think

723
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:15,759
having a centralized App Store is one of

724
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,789
the key ways you know that that you

725
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:21,070
increase the resilience of the platform

726
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,940
you keep bad stuff away from it and

727
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,480
Microsoft just opened their App Store to

728
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,480
external full applications not just you

729
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,830
know they cross-platform mobile

730
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,840
applications that have been the only

731
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,710
thing on there before okay all right

732
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,999
okay thank you
