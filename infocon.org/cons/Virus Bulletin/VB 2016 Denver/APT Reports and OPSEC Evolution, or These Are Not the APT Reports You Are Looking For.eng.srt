1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,140
okay again these guys are in a hurry

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,160
because they told me they've got an

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,629
hour's worth of material they're going

4
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:09,120
to try and get into 30 minutes so

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,429
without further ado two troublemakers

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,719
from Israel India we are I'm in bar this

7
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,029
is gaudy thank you for not leaving we're

8
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,890
going to talk about apt reports in the

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,050
evolution of optics and how it actually

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,090
brought the malware to the stage it is

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,539
today which is kind of sort of relating

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,730
to the last question or the first

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,439
question that will just act and we also

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,620
gave it another title these are not the

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,920
apt reports you're looking for because

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,600
we will articulate that the format is

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,250
not exactly as it should be

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,800
why are we actually here for a number of

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,260
things we want to simplify the attack

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,789
process because you can make it as

21
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:49,230
complicated as you want but at the end

22
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,480
the consumers need to understand and

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,430
they don't come from our background we

24
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,809
want to demonstrate the evolution of

25
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,329
various actors over time as what we

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,030
claim as a result of their reading apt

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,520
reports how we want to suggest some ways

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,549
to close the gap or maybe make it a

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,700
little bit better for the good guys on

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,170
that note I would like to start with a

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,600
story that will frame the discussion for

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,670
us so we all know there is malware out

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,460
there nothing new with that however one

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,100
day the mandiant report on apt one came

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,130
out I wasn't really shocked I doubt many

36
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,320
people in the room we're but he changed

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,680
everything the extent of the exposure

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,520
both of the apt threat actor as well as

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,720
in the media was insane more than that

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,430
their operations were significantly

41
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,920
disrupted some say that they disappeared

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,560
up to a year and a half after they were

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,259
essentially disclosed to the world they

44
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,780
weren't alone we have seen even back

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,310
then some others threat actors such as

46
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,990
Stuxnet and flame there's some

47
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,670
interesting things to say about them for

48
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,180
example Stockton was very tight it was

49
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,329
500k or so when that disclosure happened

50
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,219
naturally we believe that the threat

51
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,920
after was damaged but what the damage is

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,770
big as when flame was disclosed which

53
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,319
was clearly a scaled operation

54
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,019
with twenty megabytes in it with their

55
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,730
tools their vulnerabilities I mean I'm

56
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,120
trying to think about being in a meeting

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,530
after his flame was disclosed to the

58
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,719
world with all your tools of

59
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,560
vulnerabilities just gone like that that

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,599
has got to be a very weird meeting when

61
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,250
somebody got fired I'm just saying

62
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,049
so the different scales to these

63
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:36,599
operations and we can see actors

64
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,900
actually start adapting for example you

65
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,459
could see Gauss it will scale the

66
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:42,510
Federation I believe they're at about

67
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,959
2000 targets that got hit but also they

68
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,939
had a specific target specific variant

69
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,400
that attacked a specific machines and

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,049
was encrypted to it you had to have the

71
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:54,180
right parameters to open it I'm not

72
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,389
aware that it was ever decrypted rocket

73
00:02:57,389 --> 00:03:00,829
Khitan just using off-the-shelf implant

74
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:03,989
core impact because they didn't want to

75
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,299
lose their toolset or at least their

76
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:07,859
first stage in that particular case

77
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:10,730
second stage toolset and patch work well

78
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,019
that was really interesting because we

79
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,299
felt kind of deja vu everything we

80
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,310
watched was code taking the stone from

81
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,290
forums from github

82
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,169
from all over the place including their

83
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,780
second stage toolset so when the first

84
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,639
one is compromised and taken by a

85
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,040
researcher so little is very interesting

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,918
to watch the evolution of threat actors

87
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,109
just try to think that you are in that

88
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:39,449
particular meeting and you're talking up

89
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:41,099
second how to plan these operations

90
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,720
before and after so OPSEC operational

91
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
security in 60 seconds

92
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,139
why do you actually need object objects

93
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,259
something you do for three reasons comes

94
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,060
from the army army everything is in

95
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,759
three first you want to ensure success

96
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,859
you've gone through all that trouble on

97
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:02,909
creating a plan creating tools you want

98
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,349
it to succeed you don't want to fail you

99
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,209
want to make sure that you're not

100
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,989
detected because detection shortens your

101
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,459
available time on the target it has

102
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,169
repercussions maybe you have to change

103
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,780
tools and you have to abandon the target

104
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,180
all together and you want to prevent

105
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,358
attribution now nowadays as you've just

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,389
heard there's this is not so much a

107
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,010
problem used to be because there are

108
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,210
ways to bypass that

109
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,550
but originally this is what you do in

110
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,910
order to prevent the attribution and you

111
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,470
can compare that to normal processes

112
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,740
that are not apt involved for example

113
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,350
the software development cycle or risk

114
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,780
assessment risk management it's the

115
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,520
things that you do to make sure that

116
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,009
stuff goes well doesn't you know break

117
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:49,050
down and everything is in order

118
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,810
now when would you actually compromise

119
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,180
the OP stick these are the reasons that

120
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,430
malware actually gets caught and then we

121
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,620
all read about it so first of all you

122
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,229
have the time to market to develop a new

123
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:02,610
tool from scratch to find

124
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,070
vulnerabilities to right tool to evade

125
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,960
all the detection mechanisms that takes

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,500
time

127
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,849
and sometimes you don't have that time

128
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:12,630
so you may compromise it scalability if

129
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,270
you have a lot of targets you would want

130
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,830
to have a different tool for each one so

131
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,900
in case you know Kaspersky CAPTCHAs one

132
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,000
of the samples you don't have the whole

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,729
tool chain coming down but you can't do

134
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:25,020
that because if you have many targets

135
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,419
you can't develop different tools you

136
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,160
may compromise it and these of

137
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,949
deployment sometimes the delivery the

138
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,130
malware is a big operation structure it

139
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,810
was a huge thing we don't exactly know

140
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,820
what happened there in theories goes as

141
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,010
far as people came in through USB drives

142
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,990
or use drones or whatever and sometimes

143
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,130
you can't do that interesting I didn't

144
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:54,650
even know that so back to where we were

145
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,130
apologize for that so generally speaking

146
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:02,070
every apt report that you guys read or

147
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,729
write is the result of some failures

148
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:08,460
some objects failure that created the

149
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:17,220
problem so continuing from this point we

150
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,590
have one case maybe there are others

151
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,759
we're not aware of where we can actually

152
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,740
look behind the scenes and see what the

153
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,169
attacker is thinking that is in this

154
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:26,940
particular case sucking things and as

155
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,320
you can read here the font isn't very

156
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,110
big the citizen lab reports quoted an

157
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,990
email that said their primary concern

158
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,240
seems to have been not getting caught

159
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,750
again just imagine for a second the

160
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,039
economic cost

161
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,129
of not being able to continue operations

162
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,800
for a year and a half of stocks method

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,479
code in it it was 12 years old

164
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,539
imagine running let's say 25 under

165
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,159
operations a year for twenty twelve

166
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,039
years with this code or parts of it and

167
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,930
all of a sudden all that all these

168
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,509
different operations targets are gone

169
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:02,009
and you can't keep working for about a

170
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:03,240
year in a house not to mention the zero

171
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,710
days and everything around that by the

172
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,149
way there's a recent example with the

173
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:07,919
NSO tool that got caught and all of a

174
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,869
sudden you lose a lot of infrastructure

175
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:11,879
you lose volume is that you're

176
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,009
exploiting there's a huge cost of being

177
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,949
caught so we we reach the conclusion

178
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:23,879
that as a consumer of apt report most of

179
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,620
them actually quite suck there are few

180
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,349
reasons the first one this is something

181
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:29,580
that we've been saying for a while now

182
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,589
this whole agenda has been going on for

183
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:32,270
over a year

184
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,069
sometimes as a malware researcher you

185
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:38,339
feel like something in the spirit of a

186
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:40,860
sports commentator why because you stand

187
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,169
on a stage and you talk about how good

188
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,099
the other guy is right and it's not

189
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,709
exactly what we we think we want to see

190
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:52,800
in a PT reports they're very long this

191
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,419
was also mentioned in the previous talk

192
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:57,930
some of them are 60 pages long if you're

193
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,589
a an IT security guy or some other

194
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,419
security professional at a company can

195
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,519
you really reach 60 pages every time and

196
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,449
it's all that content relevant to you a

197
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,639
lot of it as we've just heard is for PR

198
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,189
reasons companies have public versions

199
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,499
of the documents and they have customer

200
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:18,199
only versions and the one that go out

201
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,879
sometimes our more aimed at PR and

202
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,339
building the reputation of attention not

203
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,629
to mention also writing for ourselves

204
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,759
what will other researchers think is

205
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,219
opposed to the actual target audience of

206
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,760
the report yeah and as a result there's

207
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,990
an asymmetry that's being created get it

208
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,429
okay you don't get it get it

209
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,040
so there's na asymmetry between the

210
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,360
benefit that the attacker takes from

211
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,009
these HD reports and the benefit of the

212
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,889
defender or the actual consumer and then

213
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,199
the attackers are like oh really this is

214
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,639
interesting all that stuff that you've

215
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,769
discovered tell us more about your

216
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,019
abilities but the problem is that it's

217
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:00,660
not just the actor that has been caught

218
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,709
everybody else is reading the same

219
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,350
report and drawing their own conclusions

220
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,269
what did the other guy do wrong that we

221
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:10,209
can not repeat next time all right

222
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,519
the apt report apt one report kind of

223
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,589
made a for everybody else

224
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:20,649
essentially it's like having three QA

225
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:23,230
when you do a PT report and we can look

226
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,569
at some lessons learned over time from a

227
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:28,060
PC one when they had a very simple C&C

228
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,740
server I don't have been able to

229
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,089
remember with an IRC I don't think it

230
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,319
was a nice evening anyway a very

231
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:35,350
simplistic C&C server I like to Carola

232
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,199
with satellite truck hijacking which is

233
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:41,170
kind of interesting there is learning in

234
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,470
progress so code sharing ecstatic Dooku

235
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,980
flame add some code sharing in there and

236
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,850
then you never know

237
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,519
iron tiger for example if we're sorry

238
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,829
for throwing names of and name

239
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,059
conventions everything is kind of

240
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,889
confusing but just go with us on this if

241
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:57,970
you don't recognize the CEO to me that's

242
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,519
fine iron tiger was clearly Chinese or

243
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,939
was it correct Oh damask everything fits

244
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:07,180
so well we're so sure who it was well it

245
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,420
may be false flag dukkha - there's so

246
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,069
many false flags in there we're not

247
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,329
really going to go into this too much

248
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,279
because the entire talk before us talk

249
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,139
exactly about this issue which was

250
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,910
amazing for us to really drill down on

251
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,110
that but do you really ever know so you

252
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,370
read an IVP report amazing what do you

253
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,740
get out of it if you err the actual

254
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,920
consumer first of all a lot of malware

255
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,379
and all the amount of either screenshots

256
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:37,750
you get the report is really important I

257
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,850
love those then you get some IO sees

258
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,379
some commanding control set up sometimes

259
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:45,959
maybe

260
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,769
attack vectors a little bit and the

261
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:52,689
actual attacker objective motivation and

262
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:54,080
what we know about the intelligence

263
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,210
hirato and the graph is invert here

264
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,860
because on the left it's the stuff that

265
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,320
is least useful and on the right is the

266
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,150
stuff that's most useful like you get

267
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,880
the least of it so considering this is

268
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,160
the usual distribution in apt reports of

269
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,800
information that's useful to us why do

270
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,690
we keep writing them the same way do we

271
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,460
just have this information or do we

272
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,190
choose to write it this way so what we

273
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,780
want to get into is what we call the

274
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,630
engaging process essentially when we

275
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,460
look at the various investigations and

276
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,160
apt reports there is a lot of effort

277
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,560
that goes into reverse engineering the

278
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,790
sample what's going on with them and

279
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,980
that's fine let's do forensics what we

280
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,890
are interested in is region earing how

281
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,380
the attackers actually work so that we

282
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,710
can create understand what the

283
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,560
methodologies are create a simplified

284
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,650
model we can learn and grow it and we

285
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,340
call this the engagement process so

286
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,950
we're going to start we're going to

287
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,470
start by looking at a curse ID all right

288
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,270
because every attacker is like a hacker

289
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,740
with who do you think first thing you

290
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,390
have to compose your intelligence

291
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,830
requirement this is your shopping list

292
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,870
as an attacker what is the states that

293
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,530
you're after

294
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,490
then the second thing is I'm sorry we

295
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,170
have some examples now see that's your

296
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,830
yeah yeah this one so if you want to

297
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,000
compose your intelligence with lines

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,530
it's kind of very simple you ask some

299
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,890
question for example that's what I was

300
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,020
saying have wmd I think it's far enough

301
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,490
in history that people are not too

302
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,840
attached to the subject so that's why we

303
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,070
chose it where are the WMDs does he

304
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,850
intend to use the WMD always working on

305
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,800
the WMDs can we get Matt Damon back some

306
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,180
people got the jokes this time that's

307
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,800
pretty cool

308
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,210
so the second stage after we know what

309
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,710
we're looking for is where can I find

310
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,960
these answers or who all the information

311
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,020
I need so for example we can have talked

312
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,260
about some verticals such as banking or

313
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,390
aerospace and we can talk about specific

314
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,950
targets such as gaudy as the information

315
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,120
that you would want

316
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,290
the thirst page the intelligence

317
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,730
gathered this is all information that

318
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,939
you gather before you attack how to and

319
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:14,059
by that to make a decision on how to

320
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,980
choose your tools choose your way doing

321
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,410
that gives you the target report this is

322
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,089
the document this is a little bit of

323
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:25,559
military drill I don't know the word for

324
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,259
that but yeah German this is what we do

325
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:30,959
in the Army now you have a target report

326
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,369
that has all the information that you

327
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,860
need in order to make a decision on how

328
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,990
to do it and then you make the attack

329
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,509
plan the attack plan consists of two

330
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:42,269
parts the first part is how you do think

331
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:44,550
the plan we're going to come through

332
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,110
here and there's going to be another

333
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,899
effort and the second part is what is

334
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,970
the tool that we're going to use what

335
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,949
are the weapons or we are going to use

336
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:55,740
these are decisions made based on the

337
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,259
target report for example the family of

338
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:03,749
Stuxnet Dooku flame in Gaza they all

339
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:07,619
carried some very particular weapons for

340
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:10,559
some very particular targets whereas in

341
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,480
the case of one of the attacks that

342
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,459
they'll reported the attackers were

343
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:17,759
using the already installed what was it

344
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,649
the management system it's an open

345
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:21,360
situation of provisioning system yes

346
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,639
yeah so they use an existing tool that

347
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,829
was installed at the target to

348
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:28,019
proliferate so you choose your weapons

349
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,110
based on the target and that doesn't end

350
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,170
because once you attack you only have

351
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,879
one system and that is usually the

352
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,069
weakest link and from there you have to

353
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:39,899
proliferate you have to move on to the

354
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:40,649
other computers

355
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:43,470
lateral movement so now it all repeat

356
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,990
I've gotten hold of the first computer

357
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,549
now I want to move to the next one so

358
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:49,319
once again has to collect intelligence

359
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,110
and to draw the target map and I have to

360
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,100
decide what to do now the problem is

361
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,379
that right now we're no longer outside

362
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:01,559
we're already inside the destination so

363
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,720
it used to be this one you do upset you

364
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,480
are worried about very simple things

365
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,100
what are the controls my target tab do

366
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,829
they have an antivirus for example with

367
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,019
evolution they start caring about what

368
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,850
are the back-end capabilities the vendor

369
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,699
has for example Kaspersky KSM what could

370
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:18,390
they do to us

371
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,220
later on regardless of what was

372
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,920
installed on the system and more

373
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,040
recently let's look for other players

374
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,230
ragging for example if you read the

375
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,880
report there was a term there that was

376
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,560
called a PC magnet I'm not going to tell

377
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,019
the Kaspersky story but essentially hey

378
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:35,820
this machine is infected with so many

379
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,339
apts we wonder what else is on there now

380
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:39,720
we have to take care of the aspect of

381
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,899
the opponent what are they doing wrong

382
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,760
that could potentially make us

383
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,089
vulnerable to detection you really

384
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:50,220
really need to try to hide your identity

385
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,160
right now or as we'll see change your

386
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,579
strategy completely not care so in one

387
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,730
of the examples of a campaign the

388
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,790
attacker was acting on the target the

389
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,130
target has it's a net responding by

390
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,440
crowd strike that showed up and once the

391
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,899
attacker noted that somebody else was

392
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,940
there looking at them they disappeared

393
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,130
and we heard a similar example in the

394
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,769
previous talk compilation times which

395
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:18,089
was also mentioned mentioned in the

396
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,130
previous talk when you look at the

397
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,899
difference between the compilation time

398
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,790
in the inspection time that reveals

399
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,579
information he tells you what the

400
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,010
ability of the attacker is from the

401
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,199
moment of creating the malware to

402
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,540
delivering it and in the case of Fox

403
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,910
News we're talking about some very

404
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,670
guarded facility and it tells a lot

405
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,920
about your ability to close that gap in

406
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,769
such a short time some other examples

407
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:48,720
some groups whenever possible use tools

408
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,000
that are installed on the computer that

409
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,290
way you don't need to develop your own

410
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,510
they cannot be blacklisted they will

411
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,070
always be there I mean we all see

412
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,750
especially I mean the more the time

413
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,579
moves on the more this power show is

414
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:02,699
being used I mean that's one of the key

415
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:05,189
I guess TTP's foremost threat actors out

416
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:08,490
there nowadays and dukkha too is an

417
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,530
interesting example because they

418
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,569
actually were so confident in their

419
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,849
ability to control the network that only

420
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:17,400
a bunch of were like a small bunch of

421
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,919
computers actually had code installed on

422
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,049
them the rest of the computers were just

423
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:24,449
running stuff in memory because they

424
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,179
were so confident you see how we're

425
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,130
moving forward in there's an evolution

426
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,920
in the object of the attacker

427
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,930
one of the interesting things that we

428
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,270
found in a research that is rarely

429
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,980
mentioned whenever people talk about the

430
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,750
various types of kill chain buzzwords is

431
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,890
the full retreat stage for example Red

432
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,870
October it took them a while and you can

433
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,100
duck the costume somebody from the great

434
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,540
thing about this to dismantle their

435
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,340
infrastructure with the mask though

436
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,470
careto within four hours writing a blog

437
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,340
post just said the mask they were gone

438
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,930
our supposition this is a story we can

439
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,810
prove it is with Dooku - they didn't

440
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,520
wait for publication they hunted the

441
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,670
vendor down that is how we see the

442
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,300
evolution of essentially mr. adaptors

443
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,190
and it's counter examples people who

444
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,800
just don't care if they are being

445
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,180
discovered if they even look for that

446
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,340
are a p12 and does the hunter team

447
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,330
although after I think they haven't

448
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,190
really followed up on them the past six

449
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,300
or eight months so they could have

450
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,670
changed so now okay now we switch over

451
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,280
to the defender side so we've shown the

452
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,600
different stages and how the attacker

453
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,790
things now let's talk about the defender

454
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,490
side and here we're actually trying to

455
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,050
answer some of the problems that our

456
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,170
previous speakers mentioned we're going

457
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,910
to show the problem in the existing

458
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,580
situation what the takeaways are and

459
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,980
what we recommend that the defenders or

460
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,760
the consumers of the apt reports to

461
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,260
stage one we said compose intelligence

462
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,150
requirement there's not enough

463
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,940
information on attacker objective not

464
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,070
enough because the attacker objectives

465
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,750
are what information was actually stolen

466
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,550
and many times that is not something

467
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,780
that people disclose so the result you

468
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,340
have to understand that it's like having

469
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,740
a stalker they really like it's not

470
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,960
going to end just one there's this

471
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,050
example there was an attack and then

472
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,600
there was an intervention nucleotide

473
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,660
shutout from bill 4q work cube route at

474
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,260
RSA 2014 for the critics and then a few

475
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,890
days later the attacker returned okay

476
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,650
now stealing data is just one of the

477
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,170
options now everyone who's been working

478
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,210
with malware knows that basically once

479
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,410
there's a malware and computer you can

480
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,420
do whatever you want but all the stuff

481
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,210
that gets published is mostly data set

482
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,940
so it's building this understanding in

483
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,750
the customers

484
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,700
I had that that's what I'm worried about

485
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,370
if someone steals my data but as the

486
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,940
Sony case showed us sometimes it goes to

487
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,220
different directions they erase a lot of

488
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,980
data we add the attack on the Saudi oil

489
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,720
rig it's not always about stealing

490
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:06,680
information you can also change it so

491
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,990
this is where we'd like to talk about

492
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,750
that action perform a meaningful risk

493
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,130
assessment risk assessments used to be

494
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,510
this book that you would throw around

495
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,310
after spending a lot of time creating

496
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,220
for compliance if you take into account

497
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,740
hey this Trojan horse can spy that means

498
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,870
it can also destroy the risk assistance

499
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,190
can be meaningful for your daily

500
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,820
operation compile it sorry place the

501
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,220
second stage there is no time-sensitive

502
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,320
information out there in many cases

503
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,520
which means we can't really distinguish

504
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,900
a pattern if you have similar platforms

505
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,300
similar data you are on the list

506
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,890
if you seek target getting on let's

507
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,780
start thinking they own those systems do

508
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,350
I have those systems and here is where

509
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,330
you can perform for example at threat

510
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,160
assessment this is something actually

511
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,560
happening in the world don't wait make

512
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,270
sure operational you understand this

513
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,470
could happen to you now it's no longer a

514
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:04,580
risk now we come to the inside the

515
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,940
organization stage right and here there

516
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,530
is a pre engaging stage and an engaging

517
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,860
stage it's a pre-engagement there is a

518
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,630
lot of publicly available data there is

519
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,730
a lot I can discover about my objective

520
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,920
about my target just by scanning the

521
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,320
internet stuff gets scanned it gets

522
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,840
indexed it gets posted and you don't pay

523
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,580
attention and there's a lot there that

524
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,130
can be used by an attacker there's lack

525
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,320
security awareness that allows probing

526
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,510
and by that I mean for example people

527
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,030
making phone calls and just asking some

528
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,490
questions and getting answers or maybe

529
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,400
doing some port scanning and no one

530
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,720
cares about port scanning because you're

531
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,800
saying oh it's just for scanning

532
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,320
whatever it's not really an attack but

533
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,180
the attacker gets all that information

534
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,790
and the takeaway is that the attacker

535
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,330
can gain a lot before actually getting

536
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:56,600
to you so what you need to do is limit

537
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,300
public information and it's

538
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,400
easier said than done but whenever

539
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,060
possible don't put our ganna grand try

540
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,910
not to give away all sorts of email

541
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,470
addresses and stuff that can be used

542
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,250
against you

543
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,470
you want to act outside your perimeter

544
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,420
is something we've been talking about

545
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,260
also don't wait for them to come to you

546
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,180
there are companies that deal with that

547
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,520
they do intelligence research they will

548
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,950
try to find signs that the attackers are

549
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,900
on there waiting before they actually

550
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,450
come if you can find this Intel provider

551
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,990
use them and this has to be periodically

552
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,510
refreshed because just like any other

553
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,390
thing that is annoying and security is

554
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,060
annoying in safety is annoying only when

555
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,770
something bad happens then people get

556
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,840
aware and then for a while they remember

557
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,420
not to connect unknown use the devices

558
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,140
and not to click on emails but every now

559
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,820
and then you know nothing happens and

560
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,610
then all of a sudden everybody forgets

561
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,630
that so you have to go through that

562
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,590
again and again and it seems obvious but

563
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,190
it's not ok we work in this area but

564
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,410
most people that read the reports they

565
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,940
are not there are no researchers there

566
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,160
are people whose job is to make an

567
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,080
organization secure usually understaffed

568
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,630
under budgeted so what is obvious to us

569
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,090
is not necessarily obvious to them in

570
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,060
the engagement stage there's not many

571
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,370
people or organizations share the

572
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,710
lateral movement stage I don't know why

573
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,870
whether they think it's not interesting

574
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,760
because same malware so what difference

575
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,260
does it make or maybe the way that the

576
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,810
lateral movement was done exposes

577
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,210
vulnerabilities or some bad things that

578
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,760
you do or date into right so there's not

579
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,940
an honest formation and the takeaway is

580
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,430
the engagement cycle is not a one-time

581
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,790
thing it takes a while ok because they

582
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,700
will infiltrate in the weakest link and

583
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,710
from there they will move on because

584
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,600
usually they're after some information

585
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,460
on a computer that is hopefully not

586
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,330
publicly accessible and that means that

587
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,580
you have a number of opportunities to

588
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,890
interfere with that it's not a one-time

589
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,750
thing but if you miss it that is it's

590
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,180
over no it's not like that so what can

591
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,310
you do you need to put as many out

592
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,410
pickles as fast as possible layer

593
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,450
security god I can tell you all about

594
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,540
deception put rocks on the road of the

595
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,370
attacker make them have to deal with

596
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,730
them by time to give you response time

597
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,560
it don't be shy

598
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,410
share whatever you can because the

599
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,180
attacker has learned from our analysis

600
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,970
of their tools we need to learn from the

601
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,810
analysis of their method okay we need to

602
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,020
learn on our side as well so we're going

603
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,760
to run to the end because essentially

604
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,240
you're starting to get the conclusion

605
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,170
this is really important to us

606
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,760
personally one of their studies we have

607
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,590
about the field changing leaders we

608
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,510
changing the attackers can obviously

609
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,230
destroy forensic evidence and they do

610
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,300
snapshots and logs can save the day but

611
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,190
it's waste is it's no longer just about

612
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,930
monitoring or sending it to the steamer

613
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:06,400
stock but backing up the data can be as

614
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,080
important if not more important when

615
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,690
forensic comes in at work the way for us

616
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:13,830
to speak about this in a way is that

617
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,450
effectively whether it is needs to

618
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,880
happen or not a lot of our security is

619
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,490
incident response that's our biggest

620
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,030
control or should be or is in many cases

621
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,210
if we do not have these logs this

622
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,090
information backs up that is very bad so

623
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,190
for us embarked came up with this term

624
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,770
I'm going to throw this out in create a

625
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,350
backup response plan or as we like to

626
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:43,840
call it burp now try this at home our

627
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,340
purpose here was just to take you

628
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,510
through it but if you have an agency

629
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,000
report you're creating one or you're

630
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,860
trying to use one for the intelligence

631
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,760
at your organization go through this how

632
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,290
much information that's relevant do you

633
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,660
have there and go to the engagement

634
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,360
process and try to see how can I use

635
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,450
this with my defenses as opposed to just

636
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,850
taking the IOC s copy pasting them and

637
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,700
whoever here uses a poutine IO season

638
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,560
report as a picture thank you very much

639
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,030
please stop but just saying try go into

640
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,980
this process yourself l Tasha fights

641
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,030
back demand better equity report from

642
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,750
your vendor so there is a problem that

643
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,400
we call the decline of shame and it has

644
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,080
a lot to do with what the previous talk

645
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,300
was about the attribution at the

646
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,340
beginning before we started distributing

647
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,010
and actually detecting stuff then people

648
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,290
were really really careful they went out

649
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,330
of their way not to be detected but then

650
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,010
we started capturing them and we started

651
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,680
outing them and all of a sudden it it's

652
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,420
a nun secret everybody is attacking

653
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,110
everybody and no one cares about being

654
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,930
caught and it's true to some particular

655
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,720
actors to the extent that sometimes they

656
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,810
won't bother hiding the the tools or

657
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,730
sometimes the agenda is so obvious that

658
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,730
they just don't care okay and this is

659
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,070
also probably because of the way we're

660
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,720
dealing with that so what we would like

661
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,000
to see better more actionable like PT

662
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,090
reports also mentioned before earlier

663
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,880
breach report give us the heads up let

664
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,470
other people know something is going on

665
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,740
so they can raise your defenses and

666
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,120
actionable public information sharing

667
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,160
and enough with the attribution

668
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,410
addiction thanks guys for the previous

669
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,050
talk and it's essentially the previous

670
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,090
tough talk a lot about attribution there

671
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,140
are two points we would like to make

672
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:37,030
here to emphasize here number one no

673
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,980
more attribution based on IP addresses

674
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,230
please it's a complex subject you just

675
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:45,940
shared 30 minutes on that number two yes

676
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,350
I understand what attribution can be

677
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,880
imported to some but think about all the

678
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,590
resources you put into it issues you

679
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,060
could have put into the sense or

680
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,690
research how do we actually help you

681
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,890
that's like the way it heads up to date

682
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,690
Marcus about that tribution whatever I

683
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,980
speak about attribution I mention him

684
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,880
and it's final words number one apq

685
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,680
report can be a huge help we have seen

686
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,930
out thread afterwards evolve lets evolve

687
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:13,480
too let's stay under six yes we are

688
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,980
there QA but if they have to keep

689
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,960
changing if we can increase their

690
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,670
economic cost for operations that is

691
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,220
significant let's keep doing it let's

692
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,210
just change our focus slightly that's

693
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,960
pretty much it

694
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,929
and with that we would like to thank you

695
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:37,029
very much we appreciate your time I

696
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,610
don't know if we have time for questions

697
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,769
because there's a break but sister the

698
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:44,899
break you can just come in after yeah I

699
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:46,909
think with like one question before

700
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:49,639
lunch Angela anyone got a pressing

701
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:50,169
question

702
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,210
no really everybody wants to go to lunch

703
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,769
in that case I think we should give in

704
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:57,399
bara hand

705
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,860
