CSIS who's going to talk to you about

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,379
never quest the crime is a service and

7
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:19,500
on the hunt for the big bucks okay

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,410
thanks it is on anybody can hear me so a

9

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,329
gonna try to keep you on your toes just

13
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,100
a quick rundown on the agenda for today

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,930
I've got like 30 minutes that's

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,120
definitely not enough time to cover this

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,149
but I'll do my best anyways the quest

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,010
begins overview abstract what is never

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,250
quest coding protocol analysis

19
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,649
prevalence and geographical spread

20
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,120
something about the vulnerability in

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,649
pony which is being used as the first

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,469
stage infection and being used also to

23
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,530
extract username and passwords in many

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,329
of the most prevalent never quest about

25
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,870
shrek campaigns going to dig into the

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,960
infrastructure look at the the command

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,119
control servers look at how they stay

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,450
actually were operating yes server

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,580
infrastructure at the panel and the

30
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,009
money mule accounts but some potential

31
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,560
also millions and aunt missing link and

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,390
then finally the latest development have

33
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,400
been brushing this up because as you

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,979
know virus bulletin presentations always

35
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,710
like four months you know in in the past

36
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,720
and they always did strike out page

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,390
really quickly so I had to like putting

38
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,369
the latest stuff that we see here from

39
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,610
from this criminal gang and then I'm

40
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,320
going to share some quiero rules for

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,630
your hunting pleasures so let the quiz

42
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,540
begin so never quest is also known by

43
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,880
other names those are just one of them

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,210
some of them it's it's another prime as

45
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,780
a service they're very good at picking

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,299
those people they want to you know get

47
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,549
into their services so it's not like an

48
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,350
open crime as a service but which you

49
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,149
can get you know trawl through the

50
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,619
underground website these are very

51
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,899
particular about the people they they

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,280
get involved in the operation you slip

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,740
is the foundation actually and in the

54
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,420
later evolved into what you would you

55
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,750
know at goosey goosey we emerged as a

56
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,230
Sakuya premium app in America and never

57
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,030
quest was born out of that and HD

58
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,800
evolution is shrinking Boyd's range of

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,650
Jordan banking development it was first

60
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,520
discovered in the midst of 2013 and in

61
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,050
December 2014 profound interest

62
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,610
implemented some new functions and

63
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,250
directory is also that you will see a

64
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,760
new version out kind of confusion in the

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,500
industry generally about the what is

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,360
ghost name and stuff just to make it

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,730
quite clear it goes name is a confusion

68
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,580
is not really a not really a new banking

69
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,010
sergeant that is more a loader which

70
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,770
were used to load the main component and

71
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,390
their various modules in the middle

72
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,310
quest actually it goes way back to the

73
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,520
67 66 service which just has tied way

74
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,670
back to 2008 that is one in the dawn of

75
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,270
the banking croydon's really as you

76
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,980
probably already know it keeps our

77
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,240
kruseman was arrested in january 2013 go

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,910
super mega code was leaked and and those

79
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,070
were also being developed and has been

80
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,890
maintained and like many other droids

81
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,470
bankers we see that the source code is

82
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,820
getting league when when they kind of

83
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,750
just continue their projects the

84
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,780
internal name of go she was is FB and

85
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,700
the new panel was reported back in

86
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,150
october 2014 think actually at first i

87
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,790
found it while solo hunting for never

88
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,180
quest and ok let's let's just see what

89
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,090
is just kind of banking trojan has

90
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,090
browser holding facilities it then it

91
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,370
can do side redirects we can use HTML

92
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,590
manipulation it can basically change the

93
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,390
whole concept of a website which is also

94
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,860
some of the ways that it does when it

95
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,770
does social engineering it kills

96
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,650
antivirus products which is for you know

97
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,330
in the basement like ours it's not

98
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,550
something that is completing you but

99
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,770
it's something that we don't see so much

100
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,130
in intro and bankers it had men in the

101
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,488
browser facilities so it's able to to

102
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:21,839
hook into the browser and do various

103
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,169
things it has web in jax just like be

104
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,510
seen in the in the best shoes style

105
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,760
can do it can do web injection of go

106
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,740
further into that when this presentation

107
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,250
progresses and it have this browser page

108
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,200
and regular basis so it has all the

109
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,400
functionalities that you will usually

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,530
see as a banking croydon so it has a it

111
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,540
has actually the big latest version of

112
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,080
AB never quest of our track they call it

113
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,290
bill true at the office and and it

114
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,090
actually the latest development is dead

115
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,980
and now has a failover the gay it has a

116
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,890
primarily geared as a secondary GJ it

117
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,050
uses a soda random GTA for the fall back

118
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,360
it's been actually been there for quite

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,430
a while it's been there since 2014 since

120
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,390
they implemented the tour to web comment

121
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,940
distribution methods in in this regard

122
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,140
is emails where they use the jod the

123
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,820
usual know those methods where they

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,610
implement macros in documents and when

125
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,340
they usually opens the document it will

126
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,500
if they then activate the macro it they

127
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,880
will also activate the payload and then

128
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,660
to download tributes typically pony they

129
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,620
also also run the usual crime as a

130
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,970
service where they use export kids

131
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,950
they're going through the change it's

132
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,270
like everyone else in the business right

133
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,430
now from the from the miles of anglers

134
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,010
since the some of the guys in Russia got

135
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,920
arrested there was involved in the work

136
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,080
operation the guys behind angler got

137
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,120
kind of scared that the court that they

138
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,230
were go to great that they were actually

139
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,630
rebuild them so they decided to deter to

140
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,760
abandon the anchor project which means

141
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,020
the people are now moving to the

142
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,120
neutrino and lately been moving to break

143
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,800
which is also some of the stuff that we

144
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,450
see in in EverQuest they're being

145
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,460
distributed food awake as you go to the

146
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,330
wake X pocket first aids oftentimes

147
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,850
download pulley which is available to

148
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,680
everyone if you want to search google

149
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,750
for fur coat you probably get a back

150
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,510
door for me but but the way the thing is

151
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,400
that the pony is available to anyone

152
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,110
it's a builder basically and you can you

153
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,090
can set it up like you want and it's

154
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,420
very effective that harvesting passwords

155
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,610
from from the from the client so when it

156
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:30,990
runs it would basically clear everything

157
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,910
you have like it AP passwords email

158
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,880
passwords passwords and your browser

159
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,590
stuff like that so it will harvest

160
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,390
everything and so they've probably been

161
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,980
around a while and used to demo

162
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,540
pegging the time there's not really

163
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,010
relevant because everybody can go get

164
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:48,390
pony well actually one of the

165
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,890
interesting things is the comprehensive

166
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,900
list of target that that pony actually

167
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,060
supports it has more than one thousand

168
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,490
unique targets in there in there in

169
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,950
their various kind of web injects that

170
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,930
is that is the biggest list of targets

171
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,190
that we have ever seen in the Tour de

172
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,390
banco family before ever so in that way

173
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,010
it's very very interesting that they

174
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,830
actually target so many different brands

175
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,210
lately they've been targeting various

176
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,310
sectors outside of the financial sector

177
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,470
so they're also looking for other things

178
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,980
they're looking for job recruitment

179
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,910
websites stock market website stuff

180
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,810
Luddite so when it's when it's been

181
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,790
executed what happens is that first of

182
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,560
all it will typically download pony on

183
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,970
the first date in general that it would

184
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,130
drop the loader the loader will go into

185
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,470
the into the into the program data

186
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,480
folder which means that at some point

187
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,920
you know the user have to have some

188
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,660
rights in the system for it to execute

189
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,450
actually to run in a particular way it

190
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,720
is in a in a 32-bit and 64-bit supported

191
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,310
version as well so they go they run both

192
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:55,020
and 32 and 64 never quest execute the

193
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,480
drops BNL and uses the registry service

194
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,030
creature to exactly run to add it to the

195
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,700
registry so it's being rerun every time

196
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,980
to read the machinery boots it arose the

197
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,250
the but with with the usual way that

198
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,440
banga georgian works so it's basically

199
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,870
just involves with some with some with a

200
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,240
project ID and Enver decision a PHP

201
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,130
session ID that's very actually

202
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,920
unencoded cookie session about you never

203
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,210
cursed probably has a larger set of

204
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,210
comprehensive targets that's one of one

205
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,290
of the things several never cross

206
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,600
campaigns we've been pushed at the point

207
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,880
of sale now where as well so we are also

208
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,659
seeing and push additional malware maybe

209
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,130
we can even call it a cocktail like a

210
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,500
third stage so they also interested they

211
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,260
also push a point-of-sale Mel wow that's

212
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,360
that's one of the reason developments we

213
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,260
have been looking at this kind of

214
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,820
interesting let's particular one

215
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,950
campaign that does that we're looking at

216
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,800
20 26 different campaigns related to

217
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,570
never questioned that illustrates it's a

218
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,270
requirements of service latest project

219
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:54,630
campy

220
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,380
is a project 238 actually it's 244 if I

221
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,360
remember correctly now so the things

222
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,330
that happened since I wrote that yet

223
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,850
again we see them implement new targets

224
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,650
including investment retirement services

225
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,650
such as Vanguard and paychecks most of

226
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,100
them us services but also kind of if you

227
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,690
look at their target list if you look at

228
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,490
their the inflation maps and you'll see

229
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,500
that they also very like global they

230
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,300
they're they're not like a red you

231
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,040
seriously but bank and fingers audience

232
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,380
they're not specifically interest in one

233
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,510
country only since they spread across

234
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,430
many different campaigns you see that

235
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,190
there's different perps that are working

236
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,820
this also tends to 2am to working in

237
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,880
various countries in fact it uses Sophia

238
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,280
for the entire retirement savings being

239
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,110
stalled and I can tell you already that

240
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,570
we have seen that being done so I'm

241
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,910
going to step into the panel in later in

242
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,440
this presentation so you can actually

243
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,510
see what goes on behind the scenes what

244
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,640
is most disturbing about never course is

245
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,560
the amount of infected users that's one

246
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,750
thing but also they're very targeted

247
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,580
method day using they're going for

248
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,930
corporate businesses and the corporate

249
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,250
businesses often times have a lot of

250
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,260
money on the banking accounts so they're

251
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,000
cashing out in a similar manner that

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,100
we're seeing the CEO fraud being done so

253
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,600
they're using most of most of all

254
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,070
they're using banks and in the in the

255
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,320
Asian region so they use banks and in

256
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,330
China to use banks in Hong Kong to cash

257
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,740
out and that some of the stuff that we

258
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,750
also see being set up when you look at

259
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,090
the CEO fraudster stuff so we're looking

260
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,440
at a lot of money we're looking at

261
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,600
millions of pounds looking at millions

262
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,100
of dollars to purchase we could get lost

263
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm going to I'm going to document that

264
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,380
in a while so it has several layers of

265
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,210
protection Excel from detection and from

266
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,420
basically from from being analyzed

267
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,310
there's nothing really much so much new

268
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,080
to that but it has many of different

269
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,020
entity bugging things it makes reversing

270
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,010
a pain in the ass to be honest the

271
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,440
commander control will respond with with

272
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,810
a liquid with a list of items you can

273
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,480
see the overview here after the HTTP

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,330
request is done the trip will get with

275
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,330
respond good if we didn't provide the

276
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,030
configuration or the web in jax they

277
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,190
change that so they actually changed

278
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,380
that in the in diversion to so now it's

279
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,420
not so easy to do

280
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,060
first first and foremost they're doing a

281
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,820
lot of blood listing so if you see that

282
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,279
we are running stuff in a bag of in a

283
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,630
sandbox environment that we have a

284
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,940
machine dedicated to run bats rackin to

285
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,279
run never quest they will actually when

286
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,079
they see too many like requests coming

287
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,579
from the same IP they'll block that IP

288
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:28,430
automatically so it makes it also a pain

289
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,740
to actually extract the config files

290
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,510
automatically so that's one of the

291
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,190
things that just aside from a lot of

292
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,470
other stuff also one of the things that

293
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,480
is notable is that the configuration

294
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,600
file it used to be stored under under

295
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,160
machine now it's actually being stored

296
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,290
in memory and it's being encrypted so

297
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,670
you have to pull it out you cannot make

298
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,620
a memory dump and just you know get the

299
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,180
config file which you used to do you

300
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,130
have to have to get could be the config

301
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,839
file as well yes and basically this is

302
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:58,730
also some of the stuff could be that we

303
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,470
found out or no know how visible it is

304
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,389
you guys but this is this when we

305
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,389
started looking into them obviously many

306
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,760
of these setups operations have spam

307
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,300
mail modules and and servers for the

308
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,899
purpose of sending out spam mails what

309
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,310
we were able to do we're able to get

310
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,339
into that spam server and we were able

311
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,170
to look at what when they did their

312
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,640
spamming campaigns we were able to

313
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,620
extract all the information on regular

314
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,410
basis so with that information be able

315
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,060
to see when the campaign started what

316
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,740
the concert would be because i'ma get

317
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,050
the hashes we could get the files and do

318
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,029
analysis so every time they pushed a new

319
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:36,800
version the person who spammer on we

320
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,360
could get it directly from the from the

321
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,250
spam server which was kind of convenient

322
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,110
we can still do that by the way so we're

323
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,000
doing that automatically extracting all

324
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,170
the new frame wheels they're sending out

325
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,209
to be within that way we get all the new

326
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:50,060
campaigns if you look at the at the

327
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,459
infections you will see that the u.s. is

328
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,470
definitely the one with the most

329
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,810
infections you will then see that there

330
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,930
are there are england at the UK which is

331
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,819
also kind of interesting we got many

332
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:03,709
customers in the UK which is of course

333
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:05,510
partner interests into the spanking

334
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,399
croydon because then our customers are

335
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:08,690
actually taking quite a lot of losses

336
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,670
due to two never cost and backtrack aah

337
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,000
yeah there's 20,000 so if you look at

338
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
the infection infection

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,220
hit waves or what you call it like you

340
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,590
will see that most of it are situated

341
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,130
around Asia and US and Europe but

342
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,170
basically they are dead global so I mean

343
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,180
the this shows that this is not just one

344
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,460
of the you know usual groups that are

345
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,260
operating in one certain country he said

346
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,750
these are multiple groups working in

347
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,180
various different countries and using

348
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,010
different methods methods to spread the

349
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,710
request okay then in the bosses it is

350
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,090
one of the interesting things when we

351
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,250
will be kind of like investigated this

352
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,380
because as you remember I told you that

353
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,210
the pony was the first stage Yoda right

354
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,250
so so pony is interesting in the fact

355
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,280
that they actually has a vulnerability

356
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,580
which make it easy to to brute force

357
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,920
user names and passwords on the panel

358
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,510
one should not do that is obviously it's

359
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,940
illegal but if one actually decides to

360
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,800
do it then you can do something like

361
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,940
this you can how about you can have the

362
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,480
whole like set of Pony panels and in

363
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,730
that way you can run your your exploit

364
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,140
code if you want to do that you can run

365
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,640
the exploit code and you can basically

366
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,910
dumped all the pony panels all the

367
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,070
databases by abusing the vulnerability

368
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,010
in the cookie session so so one of the

369
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,420
interesting things about that is that

370
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,310
when you correlate this information from

371
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,830
the pony dumbs which are three million

372
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,750
usernames and passwords from unique

373
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,030
users when you correlate that with never

374
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,890
quit you get completed a single soul

375
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,360
which meaning when you look at the first

376
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,130
HR pony you look at the second stage

377
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,810
never quest and you correlate all the

378
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,390
data you'll see that the data matches so

379
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,120
so they use pony just to exfiltrate all

380
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,770
the all the usernames and passwords

381
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,110
that's an easy way to do it and then the

382
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,410
second stage they more targeted the the

383
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,230
users with with various kind of social

384
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,710
engineering and and web index data

385
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,470
stolen by pony for the past six months I

386
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,500
mean again three million usernames and

387
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,150
passwords we're unique using as my

388
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,190
passwords also you can see that they

389
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,170
steal email atras it's still email

390
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,390
username passwords entropy use names and

391
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,940
FTP and such and all of that they gather

392
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,560
together in a database and again you can

393
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,200
you can again you can target a pony

394
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,730
panel so you can extract a base if you

395
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,760
want to so if the weapon cakes just to

396
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,890
get a view of the of the massive amount

397
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,160
of targets that quite many target

398
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,280
ladies and largest is the project ate it

399
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,350
the country finally since it's almost

400
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,080
too megabyte that is very big for a

401
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,610
country for leavin that detergent banker

402
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,740
and also it you know shows that they

403
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,780
here in total it has more than 300

404
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,300
targets in just that campaign and then

405
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,650
with that adds up with the two megabytes

406
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,750
so they're very specific those engage

407
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,570
they're using we are monitoring 26

408
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,600
that's like 34 I think a project

409
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,610
different project right now in total

410
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,580
more than one thousand eight charges so

411
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,320
they didn't enter infrastructure now now

412
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,850
it gets really the kind of like things

413
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,350
that are that I think is the most

414
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,680
exciting one we have the commander

415
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,920
control servers these are the 26

416
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,390
campaigns some of them have debug

417
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,160
information you can use to do to

418
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,960
distinguish the different campaigns from

419
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,140
one another but this is basically still

420
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,960
probably URL that you can get from where

421
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,990
you can grab with an epic quest code

422
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,960
when when you look at the day of share1

423
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,370
we see a server that is located in

424
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,570
Germany and if you look at the a beauty

425
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,160
or two you'll see that the server the

426
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,900
chair to server is located in Ukraine

427
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,970
and thanks to log a colleagues in the

428
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,790
Ukrainian this oftentimes dump the

429
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,170
servers and give it to us so we can

430
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,520
actually investigate this further that

431
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,110
is reason why we have a very good

432
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,490
insight into the in for the

433
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,530
infrastructure so we got they've got the

434
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,180
server from from from the Ukraine and

435
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,550
and we dump the memory and from that we

436
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,680
were able to get a more insight into how

437
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,619
the operation is actually being run one

438
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,480
interesting things is this see this is

439
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,920
the panel this is where the bad guys

440
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,880
would log in they have various functions

441
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,770
that you would usually you know

442
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,780
recognize that sucks and V and CS and

443
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,339
analogs and you can you can choose

444
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,109
whatever you want to want to choose from

445
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,599
from that infrastructure and and one of

446
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,270
the second one is the main server that

447
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,459
is to get there is the money mule and

448
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,439
the commander console itself is located

449
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,170
in Russia much of this is pointing to

450
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,880
Russia but we believe that some of the

451
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
neighbor Chris Rodriguez is also

452
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,520
operating out of Ukraine so this is the

453
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,190
panel this is where you would log in

454
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,170
this is the overview that you have so

455
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,240
basically you could put in any target

456
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,070
you want

457
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,080
is very interesting is that the way did

458
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,240
they set this up you can buy a target

459
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,760
for amount of dollars and then you

460
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,040
prevent others doing the same crime as a

461
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,650
service from from buying that brand so

462
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,300
you could buy a brand for approximately

463
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,020
10,000 of WMC which is equivalent to US

464
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,270
dollars and that will guarantee you that

465
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,070
you own that brand in the climate of

466
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,090
service network so you don't have any

467
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,000
other colleagues if you like that

468
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,890
attacking that specific brand because

469
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,290
now you have the the royalty to attract

470
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,450
those friends this is the way that it

471
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,740
looks when you when you're walking

472
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,600
through you can add a new bank just a

473
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,040
panel you get you can add a new band you

474
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,780
can add new web injects if you do pretty

475
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,970
much everything from this panel and

476
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,180
again the different axis that are being

477
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,500
provided at this thing from the

478
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,210
campaign's so since we have many

479
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,710
different campaigns many different

480
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,840
groups they all the groups at their own

481
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,790
username and password and they give them

482
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,080
certain rights and they give them

483
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,290
certain limitations as well so this is

484
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,480
the money mules even if you look at the

485
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
amount of money because you can also see

486
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,990
that they're actually commenting on the

487
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,690
only I understand the stuff that they

488
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,610
use the money wheel for and how much

489
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,950
money is on the account I don't speak

490
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,420
Russian but some of it indicates that

491
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,030
there they are talking about 500,000 in

492
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,350
balance and it's a UK likely company and

493
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:06,050
again it's easy way to control the money

494
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,760
oh so you have a whole panel where you

495
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,040
basically can put you know new money

496
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,480
mules in and you can you can move them

497
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,130
out if they say Trick you because that

498
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,260
happens to monument they also steal

499
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,320
money from the criminals which is cool

500
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,180
and I like that so and this one this

501
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,250
decide just overview basically how you

502
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,230
can also set it up this is how you can

503
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,360
add how it looks when you add a bank you

504
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,040
can you can add different functions you

505
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,380
can put your own web injection there you

506
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,150
can basically you know put everything in

507
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,190
there and and make your own attached to

508
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,380
it it doesn't never quit that actually

509
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,300
can can act in different manners

510
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,640
depending on what kind of what kind of

511
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,370
campaign you look at this just to give

512
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,110
you an idea to something we intercept it

513
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,610
which is kind of interesting isn't it I

514
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,750
mean if you look at that conversation

515
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,030
they're doing well we gotta regatta UK

516
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,650
bank here with with two million pounds

517
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,720
on the account and they conversating

518
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,660
about trying to send that to China so he

519
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,130
would talk about like millions of pounds

520
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,480
that it actually did

521
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,770
access to already because of the

522
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,570
infection and now the bad guys are

523
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,520
communicating and actually you know to

524
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,620
communicate about we should try to send

525
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,810
just you know two million pounds to that

526
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,670
account that we just created in in China

527
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,190
so we talk about criminals that had

528
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,920
access to like millions of pounds and we

529
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,330
talk about when we look at the panel's

530
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,280
we can see that the comments and at the

531
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,840
end the communication they have that

532
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,250
they have access to approximately about

533
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,550
100 million pounds I mean that I mean

534
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,160
potentially the loss if you get from

535
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,250
from from our perspective is huge

536
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,630
because they have the access a day

537
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,250
already what they need to do now is

538
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,930
actually it's just to transport the

539
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,430
money in a way that they can actually

540
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,430
catch out and I told you already they do

541
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,740
a similar stuff is TC / setting this

542
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,410
stuff up in Tunisia and and having a big

543
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,570
set of companies where they where they

544
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,760
then float the money through because you

545
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,260
won't go into a bank and you know we

546
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,780
draw 1 million pounds without you know

547
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,790
making notice of yourself so that's the

548
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,150
way to do it so one of the ones kind of

549
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,590
interesting is that you see an overlap

550
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,720
as well on different families you should

551
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,970
cook it in there you see you a sniffle

552
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,100
you're even see Chamberlain there and

553
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,350
and just to illustrate it i put it up on

554
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,880
the undie on this chart you can see the

555
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,470
day they use the same command console

556
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,820
server it seemed like good cadence

557
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,340
people and they even have the same the

558
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,380
same API for controlling some other

559
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,400
functions so we know we know that these

560
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,070
guys are also you know depending on

561
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,100
which group it is also using other

562
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,570
criminal tools Thank encouraging such as

563
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,930
a Simba and cook it so latest

564
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,850
development this is the one of the kind

565
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,320
of the interesting stuff that comes here

566
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,930
this to juice apart never crafts are

567
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,000
done quite a lot lately to to kind of

568
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,290
like hide themselves from from

569
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,990
researchers improving commanded consoles

570
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,090
regularly it particularly the tier ones

571
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,590
making it a lot more difficult to track

572
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,160
them the block request to block IPS in

573
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,080
that way they will make it a lot harder

574
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,990
for us to extract conflicts and to

575
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,330
follow the movements several campaigns

576
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,610
have moved around now using various

577
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,290
exploit kids with them again the demise

578
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,930
of angular they are moving towards

579
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,850
neutrino no tree no retire just a month

580
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,500
ago so now they are now they're using

581
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,210
wake in some of the campaign's today

582
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,740
that we see

583
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,690
the number of active campaigns have

584
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,950
dropped within the past two months

585
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,840
however the number of targets and

586
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,410
restrictions keep static moving from

587
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,559
pony to what we known as h1n1 i think is

588
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,170
the bird proofing it's also called

589
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,910
janitor that is that is they're moving

590
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,320
from that and said basically just

591
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,740
because they're they're improving their

592
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,660
their own liberation because pony is

593
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,270
more or less and now outdated and also

594
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,179
most av's most security products

595
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:43,160
disabled to find it unless they put a

596
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,800
really cool clips on top of it late

597
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,570
assembles have implemented this is of

598
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,220
this is the interesting part is second

599
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,290
stage the DGA so it doesn't have just

600
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,960
one DJ daddy calculate it also not have

601
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,300
a second stage where it calculates under

602
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,030
tub little but sup i'm going to show you

603
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,290
that in a second and actually what is

604
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,120
very interesting is the fact that nobody

605
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,460
sinkhole that yet kept aside from us so

606
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,559
apparently nobody looks at it nobody has

607
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,230
seen it yet but definitely i don't know

608
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,059
whatever nobody has actually started

609
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,250
calling it what is also interesting you

610
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,809
came from india to sell on the under

611
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:16,520
command control side so now they

612
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,380
transport all traffic through is a cell

613
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,600
that means stolen data and web injector

614
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,510
crosses are the config file is encrypted

615
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,340
memories so we cannot easily be striked

616
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,550
it anymore is it used to be the active

617
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,530
second stage all points to this

618
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,210
particular IP address and you can write

619
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,950
it down you can take a picture of it for

620
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,720
your own you know so you can you know

621
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,640
dig further further into it if you do

622
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,110
passage ganesan it you'll find a lot of

623
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,390
hits with which refers directly to

624
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,000
should never question contains and he

625
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,429
said I just dug this up like two hours

626
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:48,350
ago so it's completely fresh they're

627
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,630
still operating from this IP you will

628
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,950
see some of the domains that they

629
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,150
already you if you can see under the

630
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,100
methods of the domains that these are

631
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,280
probably based on the dgs which it is

632
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,590
it's a fact so what I wanted to do I

633
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,880
think I still have the time period this

634
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:08,090
just to give yer just demo I'm just

635
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,170
going to put in all the TGA s into our

636
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,510
system here and make it you know work a

637
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:20,150
bit hopefully this will work so what is

638
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,919
what you're looking at is is the whole

639
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,809
DGA debris pre-calculated for the next

640
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:25,910
month so the DGA is

641
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,490
is predictable you can calculate both

642
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,740
the first and the second DGA and what is

643
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,420
happening there is that it translates to

644
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,730
to whatever to whatever you know if it

645
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,680
actually has a record you will see it

646
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,050
here and that puts us right in the

647
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,730
middle of Russia you know I remember

648
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,710
that's only that most of this comes out

649
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,810
of Russia well all of these DGA those

650
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,790
that are registered at least they all go

651
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,010
to that to that specific IP address go

652
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,010
to that host so we use the system for

653
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,900
monitoring the DJ's we use it for

654
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,700
monitoring windy when it has an a record

655
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,440
of when it doesn't so at any point

656
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,750
people register at the main that fits in

657
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,090
the DGA we are able to extract it and

658
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,920
then look at whether this is the bad guy

659
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,110
so these are sinkholes so it will go on

660
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,940
yeah we will go on forever probably go

661
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,830
crazy on you before I'm done so you get

662
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:25,010
the idea I hope and and agera rule you

663
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,210
can do this Yahoo freely it's already

664
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,210
been released this paper is already

665
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,040
available on the website so you can even

666
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,600
download it and use that for your

667
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,660
hunting pleasures and what I'd like to

668
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,820
say is that you know the updated thing

669
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,430
with the latest development if you want

670
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,870
the latest development and never

671
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,150
question you want any country files see

672
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,860
me I'm not going to push that up to the

673
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,930
website come and see me and i'll push it

674
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,910
to you guys so you get a better overview

675
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,370
of what's going on apparently they're

676
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,500
their new tactics are working they did

677
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,870
the cup of life style is working we

678
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,340
don't see people think hold it we don't

679
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,810
see people they're taking it very often

680
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:05,120
so it has low AV detection that

681
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,100
yesterday it has low visibility to the

682
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,690
to the security community in general

683
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,400
because we can see that based on the

684
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,890
single data and it has again two states

685
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,720
GGA and with that i think i actually

686
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,840
managed to some time so I think there

687
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,970
are maybe a room for four questions yeah

688
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,740
does anybody have any questions I think

689
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,450
we have time for one maybe you're

690
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,900
possibly click why do you think there's

691
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,330
such a prevalence on foreign banks and

692
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,220
foreign institutions did you see not

693
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,320
really any focus across the u.s.

694
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,470
I would say that I mean looking at at

695
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,240
never quest it's been it's been really

696
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,470
developing quite fast I think the point

697
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,210
is that you take in different groups and

698
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,889
those different groups they have you

699
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:52,950
know different you know objectives so so

700
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,539
as I see it if I understand your

701
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,110
question correctly i would say that 1000

702
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,000
targets I mean you're looking at the

703
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,309
target list of 1000 some of them are

704
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:03,929
something that we would never like look

705
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,490
for I mean I'm not even going to mention

706
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,470
it here but it also look for password

707
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,899
for a pornographic websites I mean I

708
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:11,669
mean I don't know if that worth anything

709
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:13,440
in you know in the underground economy

710
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,649
but they look at a broad range of

711
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:18,509
various targets where they can equate

712
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:20,549
exceed again they can make money that

713
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:21,840
goes from the time and stuff they go

714
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,330
from from money they go from job

715
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,279
recruitment website a lot of different

716
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,139
you know kind of industries across a

717
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:31,230
broad various of of bit of businesses

718
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,840
and in the in the US in particularly you

719
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,370
see that the most infections were in the

720
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,049
US they've been taking very much

721
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,000
interest in the US for the past 2-3

722
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,710
months and particularly true of the

723
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,690
campaigns running they target sales

724
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,669
force the target monster they target you

725
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:49,019
know a lot of different things that we

726
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,929
in Europe maybe don't even know how much

727
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:55,019
it what what what really is but how they

728
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:56,129
can actually catch other that we don't

729
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:57,480
know neither probably money with

730
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,509
recruitment like just an example hope

731
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:01,799
that answers your question or we can

732
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,639
hook up afterwards in the bar whatever

733
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:07,980
ok I think that's always fun for them as

734
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,289
I just like to say thank you Peter I

735
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,950

736
