2
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:17,279
good morning everybody

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:20,609
my talk this morning is less technical

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,640
than some of the others you'll see we're

5
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,740
going to talk about cybersecurity but

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,710
from the point of view of working in

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,690
this field how we can start out in this

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:39,329
market and what age we start training

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:41,489
and getting prepared for this field in

10
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,860
terms of computer science but not only

11
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:48,000
just in cybersecurity it's in general

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:51,030
let's go quickly into the presentation

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:02,010
because I've always been presented this

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:01:05,989
morning just give me a second because

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,989
the slide isn't moving forward

16
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:33,369
we'll skip over this first bit because

17
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,779
I've already been presented I work in a

18
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:38,410
field that's not directly related with

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:42,340
cybersecurity but in my specialization

20
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:45,280
in my area workers come into this field

21
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:48,790
I am a teacher or lecturer at the

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,540
University of castilla-la mancha and on

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:02:00,729
the master of in cybersecurity and

24
00:01:51,540 --> 00:02:03,420
security information but in computer

25
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:06,070
safety and I've worked in the

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,289
administration but the last few years

27
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:15,489
I've been working in the field of

28
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:18,220
computing and cyber security so let's

29
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,420
move on to the next slide and we're

30
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,130
going to talk about several different

31
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:27,880
things I've got a little bit of an index

32
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:30,130
here this is the title of the the talk

33
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,549
is about working in the field of cyber

34
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,609
security what do I need to do do I need

35
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,709
a degree a little bit about the

36
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:43,810
available qualifications that you can

37
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:47,400
get in the field and so different areas

38
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,870
within cyber security you can work in

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,380
what would I like to do is more

40
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,190
specifically we'll talk about

41
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,709
certificates that you can gain in the

42
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:01,620
field of cyber security and some of

43
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,090
these I think these are both

44
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,050
theoretically and in practice very

45
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,900
positive also the skills that a person

46
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,480
who specialized in cyber security needs

47
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,150
and we'll talk about training and

48
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:22,359
qualifications and continuous cert

49
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:24,820
training people involved in this field

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,000
are always in different forums were

51
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,950
different congresses and giving talks

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,800
and we're continually improving and

53
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,299
learning law what our business is

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,970
looking for and what

55
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,840
the salary can we achieve this is one of

56
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,390
the areas that I love it would seem that

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,440
there are few people in this field not

58
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:50,450
enough people and few specialists people

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,390
however that it's not really a balance

60
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,910
in what businesses or institutions ask

61
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,940
for what I'm prepared to give for some

62
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:03,770
institution we're doing a comparison

63
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:05,390
also with the US and the UK and we'll

64
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:11,750
talk about if there's a future in this

65
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:13,339
field I think the future is closer than

66
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:19,730
we think in terms of the professionals

67
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:22,160
that we need in this field start with

68
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,930
the definition of cybersecurity this is

69
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,590
taken from a sack I'm sure you're

70
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,910
familiar with it they establish

71
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,770
regulations on a global scale and

72
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:37,880
perhaps for me this is the best

73
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:42,859
definition and it's a protection of

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:46,490
information assets in short what we're

75
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,990
talking about here is if it can get the

76
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,640
information up we're talking about

77
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,570
assets and information which could be

78
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:56,120
anything anything can be a value for an

79
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,390
organization that can be systems and can

80
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:03,350
be people can be computers of any kind

81
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:07,340
and assets and information come is very

82
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:12,850
general but at the end of the day what

83
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:24,109
we do is to protect digital information

84
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:44,560
information they can find reasons why

85
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:44,560
I'm talking maybe not

86
00:06:06,639 --> 00:07:41,659
we have training training training in

87
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:44,110
terms of gang hired by companies basic

88
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,110
location

89
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:32,690
all ready to do the things that they

90
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,329
want to do and not necessarily undergo

91
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,419
studies that then they my actually at

92
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:45,710
some point if they didn't go we have

93
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:52,760
different professional families is basic

94
00:08:45,710 --> 00:09:13,100
location on a painting that is composed

95
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:15,290
reset globe RC apprenticeship you can

96
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:32,839
imagine well obviously here the salaries

97
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:53,560
are very very you can actually access to

98
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:53,560
the higher level many people who once

99
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:50,590
it's really close to the actual work and

100
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,129
[Music]

101
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,520
have been doing

102
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:59,870
undergoing I might be interested in

103
00:11:52,520 --> 00:12:02,920
having that person maybe I can thing

104
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:07,100
them maybe I can just give them

105
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:09,400
professional training so occasional

106
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,400
train

107
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,569
[Music]

108
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,159
[Music]

109
00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:10,000
together so you get 300 very very

110
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,680
training in four years

111
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:54,529
[Music]

112
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,109
[Music]

113
00:15:40,519 --> 00:16:18,449
doing coding and you think the way it

114
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:23,389
works what happens is many people say

115
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:23,389
you have to be very sure once you

116
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,130
[Music]

117
00:16:43,149 --> 00:17:22,699
and cybersecurity there are many many

118
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:30,049
things to do with cybersecurity in

119
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:35,169
vacation going to now the biggest

120
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:40,389
question do I really need a degree three

121
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:40,390
vocational training versus self training

122
00:17:41,350 --> 00:18:06,668
degree versus vocational training out

123
00:17:45,590 --> 00:18:10,340
I'm going to lie I'm going some often

124
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:12,520
require university different thing would

125
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,520
be

126
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,360
[Music]

127
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:30,710
google play to sell them and you've

128
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:37,010
always liked hanging and everything you

129
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:42,500
are that person you will need 90% to

130
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:44,450
join a company very professional

131
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:50,380
training when it comes to salaries is

132
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:55,450
not as university degree talking from an

133
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:58,370
economic point of view annual training

134
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:02,900
training you have the more if you're

135
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:04,250
going to it you may think well when you

136
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:10,460
finish a degree you didn't have a

137
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:11,929
practical training or not as much more

138
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,000
than someone who's been working with

139
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:16,000
computers since they were 14 yeah

140
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:36,580
project when they people they ask

141
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:49,960
company once those people should also

142
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,960
have further certification in CH

143
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:05,870
certifications they compulsory on the

144
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:12,500
conditions to take part in the

145
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:14,059
competition so with degree we have no

146
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:20,030
training America let's not forget why I

147
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:20,450
said before people with vocational

148
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:24,700
training

149
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,700
now how about self

150
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,069
[Music]

151
00:21:19,030 --> 00:22:13,899
now when it comes in on this if you want

152
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:28,100
I highly recommend this what field

153
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:30,950
should I choose what can we do in the

154
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,899
field of cyber security there are many

155
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:36,400
many things that you can you can do

156
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,850
cybersecurity you can work in software

157
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,160
creating

158
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:46,549
apps to manage security or even Hardware

159
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:50,539
creating equipment to protect different

160
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:55,730
areas could work perhaps in the the

161
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:58,429
legal security terms of regulation soon

162
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,440
on people working in this field don't

163
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:08,690
tend to have come from an engineering

164
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:11,870
field but to does happen sometimes in

165
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:15,470
terms of vulnerabilities or ethical

166
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:17,989
hacking and so on pen testing these are

167
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:21,169
quite popular so there's the field of

168
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:26,630
malware it's very very popular at the

169
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:30,770
moment so there's a reverse analysis and

170
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:35,120
so on all of this are very popular areas

171
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:38,600
but my advice is always to try a little

172
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,799
bit of everything if I don't try

173
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,379
something that I don't know if I'm going

174
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:45,889
to like it maybe just to do a course for

175
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:48,250
a few hours give me a general idea and I

176
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,890
might say oh I love for reversing or

177
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:55,549
it's not my particular case but you

178
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:59,240
might make ethical hacking or response

179
00:23:55,549 --> 00:24:00,799
to incidents forensics try a little bit

180
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,440
of everything that's the most interest

181
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:08,780
way interesting way of doing things

182
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:12,070
there are many different areas different

183
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,899
areas that you work in in cyber security

184
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:17,689
generally offensive and defensive

185
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:21,940
security that can relate those two main

186
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:28,580
branches we're talking about pen testing

187
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:33,200
but hunting of protecting we're talking

188
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:36,080
about there's two main definitions and

189
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:41,299
then we have the rest of the areas that

190
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:43,428
you can work in here's a list of the

191
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:44,790
different areas that you can work in a

192
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:47,940
cybersecurity

193
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:53,310
malware from digital forensics incident

194
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:55,740
handling developing tools telefónica

195
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:58,889
telefónica develops its own tools so we

196
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:02,910
have ethical hacking management of risks

197
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:06,410
a cycle hacking is one of the things

198
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:09,090
that people like most looking systems

199
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:13,670
and testing and it's also really great

200
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:17,760
area threat intelligence rat hunting

201
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:19,590
critical infrastructures critical

202
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:26,760
infrastructures Tamizh there's a very

203
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:30,300
very interesting field you can see there

204
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:34,760
are many many different installations

205
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:39,290
and not necessarily critical ones but in

206
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:46,860
different companies they look any

207
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:50,480
external people for coming in in some

208
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:54,030
companies look with Windows NT or 3/1

209
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,770
just with a card here you can say wow we

210
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,379
to do this at the beginning of their all

211
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,930
time but it's always worked like this

212
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:04,470
and if I want to change that then I have

213
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:06,420
to stop the company's system and they

214
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,790
have to put it on hold and that costs

215
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:10,710
money and so therefore companies don't

216
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:13,050
even think about it we have to focus in

217
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:16,230
a different kind of way you have to go

218
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:18,030
around the perimeter and get their

219
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:19,650
different kind of focus on it so it's a

220
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,030
field that I think is very very

221
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,150
interesting and I think it's a field for

222
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:27,600
the future as well in cyber security

223
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:33,240
the term of installations so very

224
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:36,540
interesting so certificates that you can

225
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:40,050
get the most demanded ones in cyber

226
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:43,080
security and the ones that companies are

227
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:44,940
looking for because he can be a computer

228
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,649
engineer but you don't have any

229
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,700
experience when you go out into the

230
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,710
world of work

231
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,730
and so you'll enter into a company as a

232
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,840
junior with no experience sometimes

233
00:26:53,730 --> 00:27:00,070
companies do go after a particular

234
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,350
person because would you say that we

235
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:05,080
need many many computer professionals

236
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:08,738
for cybersecurity and that this is

237
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:13,749
necessary and these people need to go

238
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:17,169
straight into companies right now but

239
00:27:13,749 --> 00:27:24,190
it's also difficult to find jobs without

240
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:26,830
any kind of qualification those that are

241
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:30,460
most abundant in the field are those so

242
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:33,519
for aisaka such as the systems auditor

243
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:38,129
and security manager these are the ones

244
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:40,749
that are most required in the field of

245
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:43,209
we look at specific something a bit but

246
00:27:40,749 --> 00:27:47,379
you'll see that these are some of the

247
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:50,669
things that are being required this is

248
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:53,830
nothing this is a safety governance

249
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:56,619
however I'm talking about a sake here

250
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:59,439
but there are some people who do already

251
00:27:56,619 --> 00:28:01,449
have a vocational training and that to

252
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,220
me tells me that that person has gone

253
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:08,109
through a practical process and tells me

254
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,759
that that person already has some

255
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:16,330
training and can sit in front of a

256
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:21,100
computer my practice might be two

257
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:23,999
different things what about the

258
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:29,019
ec-council certificate for ethical

259
00:28:23,999 --> 00:28:31,509
hackers it's a test at the end of it all

260
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:34,269
there's a subject matter that you had to

261
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:38,739
cover and then a test at the end you can

262
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:41,889
say I'm a computer scientist this

263
00:28:38,739 --> 00:28:46,320
ethical hacker certificate for me see

264
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:49,570
Council I know I'd like to work a

265
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,340
business might say that be given three

266
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,720
options

267
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,039
not to select one of those because

268
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,380
that's what I've been trained for and if

269
00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:04,010
I'm not able to do that then what have I

270
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:05,940
been trained force this is a filter and

271
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,960
certifications are important but we do

272
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:11,130
need practice

273
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,830
we need practice currently in Spain

274
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:18,029
there are some qualifications that you

275
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:19,949
can give that are issued by a company

276
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:24,600
for one for Red Team one for Blue Team

277
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:27,120
and qualifications means getting and

278
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,949
training in a specific area and you have

279
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,070
to know what that is going to be useful

280
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:35,309
for you if somebody comes to me with

281
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:41,939
practical experience then I believe in

282
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:44,389
them a little bit more so sometimes what

283
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,580
you get is what you see on this list and

284
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,950
there are other certifications that you

285
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:53,428
can get but they are very very expensive

286
00:29:49,950 --> 00:30:03,179
very expensive for what they actually

287
00:29:53,429 --> 00:30:05,970
give you so what girls do you need I'm

288
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,770
going to go through this quickly I'll

289
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,029
just talk quickly a little bit about

290
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,740
some of the things I think are a most

291
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:16,890
important asset e to learn this is

292
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:19,679
everyday today we are given a problem

293
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:22,169
but it doesn't exist yesterday so now I

294
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,510
have to resolve it today I have to be

295
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:29,390
continually learning and Kimpton t

296
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:29,390
updating myself regarding the technology

297
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:36,389
I don't know anybody cybersecurity there

298
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,928
isn't constantly going to forums isn't

299
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:41,730
getting involved in talks I don't know

300
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:43,350
anybody who really works in the field

301
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:52,980
who is not involved in these kind of

302
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:54,510
events there is a lot of sharing of

303
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,860
information between different companies

304
00:30:54,510 --> 00:31:00,039
and this is really important somebody

305
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,330
some

306
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:03,970
beginning you tend to think oh if I've

307
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:07,509
got this so knowledge then I'm going to

308
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:09,489
be better valued in the market know on

309
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:10,779
the country but if I don't know if

310
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:12,249
you've got that knowledge if you don't

311
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:21,009
tell me about that I'm not going to find

312
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:22,989
you ever it's not just that you're in

313
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:26,259
your house hidden away but it's just

314
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:30,359
that you're not exposing yourself to the

315
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,359
opportunities I'm not going to find you

316
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:39,039
and results these have the big companies

317
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:48,969
you have to be able to work under

318
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:53,190
pressure you will be faced with a big

319
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:55,359
issue you sometimes you just have to to

320
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:59,019
to resolve that and that might be the

321
00:31:55,359 --> 00:32:00,939
only thing that that employing you who's

322
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:02,889
been useful for you have to be able to

323
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,109
resolve issues whatever time of day

324
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:08,978
Saturday it's 12:00 at night if it has

325
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:10,899
to be team work you have to know how to

326
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:15,279
work by yourself but you have to know

327
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:20,258
how to work in a team a lot of work is

328
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:22,809
done from a whole many of the companies

329
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:24,249
the big companies have people who work

330
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:31,840
from home but you have to work in a team

331
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:40,269
as well you have an issue if you need to

332
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:41,949
be dynamic can have intuition that's

333
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:43,269
when you have an issue that comes to

334
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,679
mind are not really sure where it's

335
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:49,809
coming from anything of that kind that

336
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:54,009
makes you think and you just can't just

337
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:55,869
sit back we have to react and act so now

338
00:32:54,009 --> 00:33:01,570
we're talking about ethics this is a

339
00:32:55,869 --> 00:33:04,330
vocational area of employment obviously

340
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,570
when you're 13 14 doing secondary

341
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:08,710
education

342
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:11,330
have to feel the vocation at that age

343
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:13,640
but when during the first few years of

344
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:16,699
your engineering degree for example then

345
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:18,410
you do need to have that feel for

346
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:23,810
vocation and then to know whether it's

347
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:25,700
the job for you that's irrespective of

348
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,870
whether or not there's a current bubble

349
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:34,970
of employment in this that's very

350
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:39,800
well-paid most contracts that are set up

351
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:43,960
with large companies also have an

352
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:50,360
attachment to them and it indicates that

353
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:52,870
you have to you have to respond and you

354
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:57,580
must not reveal any of the information

355
00:33:52,870 --> 00:34:02,600
and this is what you're sharing with

356
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:05,480
your colleagues even teamwork is

357
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,490
absolutely essential you have to share

358
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,420
results you have to share experience

359
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:13,699
share absolutely everything in this

360
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:15,620
community in the hacker community for

361
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:17,989
example this is a community in which we

362
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,909
share everything we have a lot of

363
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:26,239
exchange is the sort of forums there are

364
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:31,100
a lot of talks never lose that interest

365
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:33,290
in sharing if you share information that

366
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,960
does mean you're of less value for a

367
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:43,330
company on the country you're of more

368
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:43,330
value to a company continuous training

369
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:52,460
training never ends never ever you have

370
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:55,400
to be continually learning here we have

371
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:59,300
a number of blogs of all different kinds

372
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:01,910
a bit darker than others some are on the

373
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:08,480
gray area and some of which I can

374
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:12,470
recommend security for example I like

375
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,860
blight a lot I like the Hispanic there

376
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,540
at the bottom so they can focus on some

377
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,060
of the vulnerabilities that are coming

378
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,830
up so

379
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:24,029
can continue update one a day you gnarly

380
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:28,380
at the bottom that you say there is a

381
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:34,470
Spanish one it's a project by Paco

382
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:36,840
Gonzalez and it's been on hold for a

383
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:41,689
while but it's now is up and running

384
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:46,760
again now and it's very good the in

385
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,760
zebra also has a lot of information

386
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:53,670
sometimes it can seem a little bit heavy

387
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,620
because there's an institution but they

388
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,940
have a really a load of interesting

389
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:01,470
information what courses can we do to

390
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:06,140
complement and add on to what we've

391
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:06,140
already learned in official education

392
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,230
recommendations here such as offensive

393
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:15,600
security that I think are essential if

394
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:20,070
you'd like to work in pen testing or

395
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:23,150
ethical hacking for example the

396
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:28,290
pentester academy over the Internet

397
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:30,660
economy code Academy some of these

398
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:34,020
courses are free and the other thing you

399
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,730
have to do is to pay if you need to get

400
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,509
the certificate or the Diploma at the

401
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:42,450
end because well these entities or put a

402
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:47,160
lot of time into these projects so

403
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:49,500
that's fine deme also has a number of

404
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,830
different courses of this kind both in

405
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,660
English and in Spanish and there are

406
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:58,230
very very many interesting things about

407
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:00,000
technology about programming of course

408
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,740
if you don't know anything about Python

409
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,550
in terms of cybersecurity then you're

410
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:15,629
nobody so specific academies that I

411
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:17,010
mentioned many that work in the weekends

412
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,150
that are available in the week they're

413
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:21,260
different many different ways of

414
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,950
forgetting additional education

415
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,840
different events that you can

416
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:28,649
participate in such as this one cyber

417
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:31,670
down the technical talks or educational

418
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:34,080
talks such as this one or even practical

419
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,610
workshops that you can avail these

420
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:41,009
events are really worth getting involved

421
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:48,860
in so SEC admin nopon name honey coin

422
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:57,960
there are many different ones and John

423
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:59,190
this is from South America day so the

424
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,930
many places that you can learn new

425
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:05,390
things it's not just about learning new

426
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:11,660
things though it's also a little about

427
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:15,420
networking and getting to know people I

428
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:17,009
just met somebody in the VIP room

429
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,080
somebody who are used to go to

430
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,570
university with but I didn't actually

431
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,720
personally know that person and it was

432
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:27,590
really great to meet him also meeting

433
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:34,470
people on the floor or in the room and

434
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:37,020
that's also way of making a community so

435
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:40,370
this is very very recommendable please

436
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,370
go to all the events that you can

437
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,440
hologram is the revolution of many many

438
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:51,359
different groups and I really recommend

439
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:57,840
this very highly I recommend you going

440
00:38:51,360 --> 00:39:00,330
into telegram continuously if you just

441
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,160
don't go in one there for one day you'll

442
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:07,440
only have about 4000 messages the next

443
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,850
day so so you have to discriminate a

444
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,970
little bit the information that you're

445
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:12,750
going to receive and find out what's

446
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:17,750
important to you

447
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:19,590
highly recommendable be info say foreign

448
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:24,840
informatica forints there was a forensic

449
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:30,300
computer hack the box they've also got

450
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:33,690
their own group in telegram talking

451
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,720
about certifications there's a group

452
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,720
which is CIA

453
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,720
espanol

454
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:49,770
there are specific cybersecurity group

455
00:39:46,250 --> 00:41:45,480

cybersecurity

462
00:43:37,229 --> 00:43:42,089

we've talked about doing university

500
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,370
degree or vocational training

501
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:29,059

502
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:15,630
it was someone who what is true is that

503
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:17,790
unless you have specific all the things

504
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:20,160
as I was saying before then it's not

505
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:23,300
really complete I mean from my point of

506
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,299
view if it's not

507
00:58:27,219 --> 00:58:40,630
by an external company then then maybe

508
00:58:30,009 --> 00:58:55,479
it should be anything else yes over

509
00:58:40,630 --> 00:59:02,289
there I just wanted to say that I've

510
00:58:55,479 --> 00:59:04,359
really liked speech I'd like to add when

511
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:05,920
it comes to training in cybersecurity

512
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:09,069
for what I've seen

513
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:13,809
looking around I've seen masters which

514
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:15,400
have very very high tuition fees I don't

515
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:19,029
know about only we see every day

516
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:22,869
Victoria but there's there's a master's

517
00:59:19,029 --> 00:59:28,869
by one of the one of the big audit

518
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:39,599
companies sorry change our people is

519
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:39,599
true that we have the big four or five

520
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:48,609
are the ones which train people yeah

521
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:51,369
that's how it works yeah and I also like

522
00:59:48,609 --> 00:59:55,839
to see in your CV the you are a private

523
00:59:51,369 --> 00:59:59,369
detective well imagine how important it

524
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:02,680
would be when they intercept your mobile

525
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:05,140
chip they take it to another phone and

526
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:08,229
they empty your account would you be

527
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:27,219
able to detect the person who has

528
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:30,269
started that well actually managed chips

529
01:00:27,219 --> 01:00:47,319
to then have them mounted in other

530
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:55,779
machine I personally difficult some

531
01:00:47,319 --> 01:00:58,739
