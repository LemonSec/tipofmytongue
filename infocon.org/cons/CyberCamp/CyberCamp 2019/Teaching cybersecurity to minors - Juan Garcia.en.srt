2
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:15,839
like to thank the organizer for having

3
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,490
me here

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:23,340
I am Chelsea fan so if I am very excited

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:26,909
is not due to the presentation it is due

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,070
to Attell see gold okay so if I see I'm

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,560
very motivated just tell me that

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,059
Valencia scored against Chelsea and I

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:41,099
will be devastated I think you all look

10
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:44,940
as the IT friend who in every Christmas

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,750
dinner needs to explain to children how

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:53,489
Instagram works in order not to in order

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:56,250
to avoid so you are in that situation I

14
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:01,129
am here to help you survive Christmas

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:05,090
dinner no I don't know if you know that

16
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:06,960
training in cybersecurity is a bit like

17
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:11,070
vaccinations I'm not talking about

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,580
preventing diseases I am talking about

19
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,089
positive externalities when we train

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,350
someone in cyber security and the train

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,869
works that successful training will have

22
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,869
a very positive impact in the

23
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,180
environment of that person and this is

24
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,619
more relevant when talking about

25
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,200
children when I say children I am mainly

26
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:43,500
thinking of children between 9 and 12

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:48,960
years in those cases when serious

28
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:55,470
problem occurs the main reaction or the

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:02:00,809
main resource of children peers and this

30
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:04,490
is more evident during teenage years so

31
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:09,199
if we are able to communicate our

32
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,199
cybersecurity strategy

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,620
you have seen all those children in the

34
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:21,260
workshops this morning so if we managed

35
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:26,370
to make those children and teenagers to

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:32,310
convey the key strategies half of our

37
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:35,760
job will already be done I wanted to

38
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:40,250
comment on these aspects I want to place

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:44,640
you into context of the questions that

40
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:48,000
children frequently ask I will also talk

41
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,570
about some practical exercises that I do

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,100
with them which are not common but quite

43
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:58,019
successful and some ideas for you to

44
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,859
share with your friends and especially

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:06,170
with those children who are jumping

46
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:10,110
around house and whom we want to protect

47
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:13,290
because we do not want anyone to do them

48
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,500
any harm not on social network not on

49
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,380
the Internet the first thing I want to

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,040
talk about is one of their first stories

51
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,380
or one of my favorite questions this

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,840
happened some years ago I don't know if

53
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,109
you know who Selena Gomez is please

54
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,510
raise your hand if you know who she is

55
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:39,840
yeah quite a few and do you know what

56
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:43,880
tick tock is raise your hand of you know

57
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,820
about tick tock which was really named

58
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:51,420
musically for those who don't know it it

59
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:54,480
is a karaoke application so you know the

60
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,700
typical thing we used to do to sing in

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,780
front of the mirror now you can do it

62
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,810
but with very cool filters and effects

63
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,620
on Instagram and then you can share it

64
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,530
tick tock is the social network that has

65
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,380
had a bigger increase in the last few

66
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,480
years and there are already football

67
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,298
teams for example who are carrying out

68
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,500
marketing campaigns

69
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:26,719
these social networks so we for example

70
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:29,300
Selena Gomez is is advertising her new

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,900
album in these kind of social networks

72
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:37,340
okay so I was speaking in a classroom of

73
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:42,080
year six and after my presentation a

74
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:45,460
girl came to my side and asked me okay

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,340
I'm gonna tell you that last week I

76
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:52,280
Selena Gomez sent me a message through

77
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:57,020
Selena Gomez in order to invite me to

78
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,030
the duet together after what you said

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,990
maybe it wasn't

80
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:07,400
Selena government and I replied indeed I

81
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,650
don't think it was a Luna Gomez this is

82
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,830
the contrast between the use of

83
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:17,090
technology and the knife instinct that

84
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:25,729
we have at certain ages I am setting

85
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:28,669
this example because parents usually

86
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:31,789
think that their children are digital

87
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:38,120
native and this is a myth the myth is

88
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:41,120
that we think children are completely

89
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:46,629
capable of using technology because they

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:50,960
were born in this era so if I was born

91
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:53,180
at the time when tik-tok was created

92
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,750
then you should know how to use it of

93
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:00,199
course not but we are speaking a lot

94
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:04,039
about the myth of digital natives and I

95
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:06,979
am sure that you will hear something

96
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:09,169
like nowadays children and every

97
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:13,128
sentence that starts with no other

98
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:17,948
children is not gonna be good and that

99
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:23,389
myth is a perfect excuse not to train

100
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:26,539
our children how to use technology they

101
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:29,580
are digital native and they know much

102
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:32,599
more than us so how am I going to

103
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:36,120
them some training it is true that your

104
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:41,030
children may know more about you but

105
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,030
life experience belongs to other hoes

106
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:47,698
due to the fact of having lived more

107
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:52,169
experiences we know more about life if

108
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:55,620
your son gets home and tells you Messi

109
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:58,650
wrote to me and is inviting me to play

110
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,319
football with him in the park obviously

111
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:03,599
you don't care about the technology used

112
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,759
you don't care if it was snapchat

113
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,919
Facebook or Instagram you don't care

114
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,370
about the social network your life

115
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:15,990
experience and your education in values

116
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:22,500
ethics which is gaming more and more

117
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:25,469
important is multi-platform we don't

118
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,759
care about the platform they use some

119
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:33,900
years ago 90% of my conferences were

120
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,440
devoted to 20 nowadays it doesn't make

121
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:41,190
any sense to even mention 20 in a talk

122
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,639
because children look at me with a very

123
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:48,419
weird face imagine if I tell them about

124
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:54,419
photo log this is like ancient times for

125
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:57,599
them despite your technology experience

126
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,448
your life experience will give you

127
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:05,580
skills do you know how to react to these

128
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:09,719
situations the fact of you being trained

129
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:14,400
or trained somebody in technology or the

130
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:16,819
fact of you talking to a friend who is

131
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,258
worried because their children use

132
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:24,479
social network the best the best piece

133
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,569
of advice that you can give those

134
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,750
parents who are worried about their

135
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:34,919
children is to create an account in that

136
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,198
social network even if they say they

137
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,000
don't care if they create an account

138
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:40,939
they

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,469
can try the social network in order to

140
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,900
know how it works and then you can

141
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:47,720
eliminate your account because when you

142
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:53,930
get to know applications you start

143
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:57,080
losing the fear the problem comes when

144
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,329
we do not know the application because

145
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,820
when something is unknown to us usually

146
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,370
we're afraid of it and when we are

147
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:11,390
afraid of it and we cannot understand it

148
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:16,720
what do we do we hide it this is one of

149
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:21,050
the main problems when talking about

150
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:25,630
children between 12 13 years old who are

151
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:30,349
hiding their problems on many occasions

152
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:36,010
willingly in good faith for example us

153
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:42,170
for sexual content in the United Kingdom

154
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:45,080
one and a half years ago they not taste

155
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:49,040
that it was a big problem because

156
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:52,220
children were claiming that when they

157
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,800
were finding sexual content on the

158
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,589
Internet they had made that they feel

159
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,670
awkward and they do not want to see that

160
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:03,440
kind of content

161
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:09,310
but we need to live in the real world if

162
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:14,450
the United Kingdom they prevented to any

163
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:17,329
sexual content to people under 18 years

164
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:20,000
old and they in the end they abandoned

165
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:23,470
that project but I think that mark crone

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
some weeks ago said that he wanted to

167
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:32,870
try that idea of course I have a small

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:38,570
kid and I would be terrified if he could

169
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:43,730
watch video with extreme violence and I

170
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:48,459
am aware of the fact that filters for

171
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,459
children are not completely efficient

172
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:55,829
as a positive thing what they managed to

173
00:10:53,879 --> 00:11:00,559
do in the United Kingdom with that

174
00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:08,059
attempt was to boost the origination of

175
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:11,459
groups of hackers when we focus on

176
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:14,100
deleting the risk eliminating the risk

177
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:16,979
as if we were able to eliminate all

178
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:20,249
risks in the universe something that

179
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,980
parents always want to do when we focus

180
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:24,809
on that

181
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:32,100
these things happen

182
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:35,790
this is report by TV when children are

183
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,970
asks are asked what do you know - do we

184
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,839
know what to do when somebody acts

185
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:46,549
online in a way he didn't like

186
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:52,819
represented girls and their 12 year old

187
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:58,379
understand many times or always is 36%

188
00:11:52,819 --> 00:12:03,809
only 6% of girls under 12 years old know

189
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:07,019
how to react in face of those risks the

190
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:09,959
important is not the risk itself it is

191
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:14,610
the management of that risk which is the

192
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:17,779
key of the problem on the right side you

193
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:22,669
can find one of my favorite graphs

194
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:33,499
regarding to minors and digital skills

195
00:12:22,669 --> 00:12:33,499
the pink bars show less competent minors

196
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:39,869
which work in a more restricted

197
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:44,868
environment due to their parents

198
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:48,059
limitations on the the blue bars show

199
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:51,169
children who can navigate on their own

200
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:56,040
without restrictions or limitations

201
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:59,249
however these grass distinguish between

202
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,750
the Rings and the harm it is not the

203
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:04,240
same

204
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:07,819
on the left side you see the number of

205
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,579
children who receive sexual content

206
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:17,410
messages or pictures logically those who

207
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:21,920
can navigate on their own receive more

208
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:25,670
of this kind however if you see the harm

209
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:31,209
on the right side you can see that it is

210
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:35,329
lower even if they are exposed to great

211
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:38,719
this is very important because maybe we

212
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:42,469
need to change our focus and train our

213
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:47,389
children with tools in order for them to

214
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:52,910
face those risks on many occasions we

215
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:56,750
focus on exceptional situations and we

216
00:13:52,910 --> 00:14:01,459
forget about daily situations I am

217
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:04,459
insulted in on foreign for Denis from

218
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:06,739
for night and if you tell them if you

219
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:10,279
tell them do not play obviously that's

220
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:15,680
not this solution or somebody or

221
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:18,050
somebody asked me to join our our

222
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,979
accounts on Instagram and you tell them

223
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:25,729
do not do not use Instagram - of course

224
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:30,290
not that's not the solution or what

225
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:32,870
about person asking out asking a

226
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,360
children out it is not important word

227
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:42,649
that happened the important thing is how

228
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:48,589
to manage that risk some sample of

229
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:53,720
strategies something that we that I

230
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:58,180
think we need to work more on I don't

231
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:03,079
know if you know my little below they

232
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:05,839
try to dismantle me on the internet the

233
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,660
important thing is to teach children how

234
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,740
to detect real and fake information on

235
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,430
the

236
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:17,960
an exercise that I usually do is to show

237
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:22,040
a profile this is a profile by of Shawn

238
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:26,750
Mendes a very popular singer and I asked

239
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:30,530
them what makes you think that this is a

240
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:34,850
real profile this is a trap question

241
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:36,680
because the obvious answer is nothing

242
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:41,500
but you can find really interesting

243
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:47,349
answers because they say the he has many

244
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:51,620
followers he has the blue the blue tag

245
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:57,170
or the is the official one for any

246
00:15:51,620 --> 00:16:04,430
reason not is that one of the tasks by

247
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:08,120
maldita below is training is it good to

248
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:10,250
put pressure on social networks on the

249
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,910
issue of fake news you know that will

250
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:21,110
reduce them yes of course it is but we

251
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:24,380
also need to have a list to Train

252
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:37,480
children in order for them to be able to

253
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:40,880
detect here when miners are asked if

254
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:44,930
they find it easy to check if

255
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:49,040
information is real or fake only 27

256
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:57,489
percent of boys 18 percent of girls

257
00:16:49,040 --> 00:17:01,640
under 12 years old say it is 27 percent

258
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:04,180
under 17 years for girls so obviously

259
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:12,829
this is something we need to focus on

260
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:17,180
another issue that I have noticed is

261
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:20,168
that we tend to blame victims here you

262
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:26,679
have some screenshots

263
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:30,039
very popular video on YouTube where they

264
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:38,230
create a metaphor where a ten-year-old

265
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:43,359
girl decides poster on the door of her

266
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:47,590
house with pictures of her then a man

267
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:50,470
passes by and he decides to enter the

268
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:55,029
house and the end is a big disaster

269
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:59,109
because those her roommate her

270
00:17:55,029 --> 00:18:02,529
classmates start posting the same

271
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:05,710
pictures in the walls of the school the

272
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:08,559
girl reacts the man is arrested

273
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:17,549
there are some details in the video that

274
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:21,340
I don't like first speak about roomate

275
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:24,220
her classmates who were posting her

276
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,559
pictures on the hanging her pictures in

277
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,190
the school the girl didn't commit any

278
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:36,609
crime

279
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:39,730
however the we cannot blame the girl

280
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:46,019
because she didn't know that she had an

281
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:46,019
option to make her pictures private

282
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,720
there are also some security breaches

283
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:57,070
which are so big that you have no

284
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:00,879
warranties at all and finally what we

285
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:04,899
need to tell children is not to hang a

286
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:06,730
poster in the door of her of their

287
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:08,139
houses because they are going to do it

288
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,989
any way we want

289
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:14,439
we have to ask them what do you want

290
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:17,409
everyone to see I mean if you have a

291
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,859
digital identity it is like having a

292
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:23,470
poster hang on the wall of on the door

293
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:26,590
of your house do what do you want people

294
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:29,859
to see maybe you want them to see that

295
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,720
there is a hole if you tell them remove

296
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:32,590
the poster it is going to be more

297
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,970
complicated

298
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:39,639
because when you reach 15 years old you

299
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:42,899
will want to have that poster we need to

300
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:45,928
rethink what we want to show the others

301
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:50,080
to give you more representative data

302
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:55,840
let's go back to those control issues

303
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:58,509
when we're speaking of how present

304
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,470
eighths of children who are given

305
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:07,210
permission to who who do not have the

306
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:13,200
permission to use on to use Internet the

307
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:17,499
percentage is similar to the one that

308
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,960
replied that their parents help them

309
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:22,960
when something bothers them on the

310
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:27,999
internet and only 23 percent of children

311
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:32,409
say their parents talk to them on topics

312
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:34,659
related to the Internet my message the

313
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:40,659
message they want to convey is that it

314
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:43,330
is very natural Norma for children that

315
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:46,389
when we are speaking with children we

316
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:50,110
tend to close the door in order to leave

317
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:57,279
all the reasons outside and we may

318
00:20:50,110 --> 00:21:01,959
discard the fact that they are gonna end

319
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:04,119
up in that digital world so even if you

320
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,340
don't know a lot about technology you

321
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:10,899
need to talk with your children about it

322
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:16,408
because this is something common for

323
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:21,820
many platforms sometimes it is just

324
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:26,110
going go doing that trip that journey

325
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:29,649
together with your children something

326
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:31,070
which is quite frequent in teenagers is

327
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:35,059
to

328
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:38,750
have a link on your profile where your

329
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:43,250
classmates can ask you questions in an

330
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:45,980
anonymous way go back in time let's

331
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:49,850
imagine yourself 15 years ago

332
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:54,740
if you had a profile where you can have

333
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:59,840
anonymous questions and comments maybe

334
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:02,210
from the girl you like you would have

335
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,510
loved it it is something quite frequent

336
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:08,780
not long ago I was asked about a girl

337
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:11,360
who had a profile in this social network

338
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:16,100
and an anonymous user was insulting her

339
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:20,479
was bothering her so how can can i

340
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:23,360
denounce this I don't use this

341
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,450
application I don't know it's reporting

342
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,409
tools the situation was not that serious

343
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,270
so as to go to the police station it was

344
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:37,040
a situation she was more or less

345
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:41,480
managing so what can we do search in

346
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:48,409
Google right it is as easy as that so

347
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:53,000
you can write denounced careers cut it

348
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:55,190
is true that sometimes since it is since

349
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,380
these social networks has an English

350
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:03,290
origin maybe you need to look for

351
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:07,370
English words it's just report careers

352
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:11,350
cut and then the first result is linked

353
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:14,629
by the official website with

354
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:18,620
instructions of how to denounce users

355
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:26,030
even those who do not have a profile in

356
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:28,129
the social network talking and going

357
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,620
through this process with your children

358
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:33,950
all together is going to be quite

359
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:36,799
positive because the most important

360
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,010
thing is for them to be a competent and

361
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:43,639
know how to look information or

362
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,570
solutions on Google for example in order

363
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:51,620
to

364
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:54,019
and I think they will no be time for

365
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,979
questions but you have my Twitter

366
00:23:54,019 --> 00:24:00,649
account so you can look for me on the

367
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,659
Internet to ask me any questions but I

368
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:05,000
wanted to tell you first about a

369
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:08,720
practical case that I carried out with

370
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,019
my son because you may be wondering how

371
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:17,740
can you apply this to my four year old

372
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:22,279
girl or boy my son is four year old and

373
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,899
likes to play with a tablet although he

374
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:27,110
prefers my laptop

375
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:29,870
he is quite smart as you can see I spend

376
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:35,379
some time with him playing on the

377
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:35,379
computer I also let him play by himself

378
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:42,830
there are some instructions that any

379
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:45,220
killed any child can understand for

380
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,908
example you cannot take a device without

381
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,519
asking permission

382
00:24:46,909 --> 00:24:51,919
you have shown time limitation and the

383
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:55,009
most important thing is that if you see

384
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,220
something weird on the screen not your

385
00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:01,070
fault so tell me about it and I will

386
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:06,350
help you to solve it that's the key

387
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:09,080
because the youngest children feel very

388
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:14,629
guilty when something wrong happens to a

389
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:19,460
digital device and that's that's been

390
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:23,090
taken as an advantage by those who try

391
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:26,409
to do them some harm because children

392
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:30,320
think they are going to be punished

393
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:36,649
however not everything that is on the

394
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:40,100
screen is the result of your activities

395
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:43,879
because sometimes you just see some

396
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:46,610
Google AdWords for example from that day

397
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:47,449
on he tells me everything that happens

398
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,059
on the screen

399
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:52,370
last week he told me something weird is

400
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:54,870
happening and the only thing that had

401
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:58,139
happened is that he had minimized

402
00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:03,120
the older that he was used in to plate

403
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:06,510
that was the perfect moment to explain

404
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,870
to him how to open more folders how to

405
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:11,850
minimize them and so on maybe he

406
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:15,360
couldn't understand everything that I

407
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,820
told him but I'm sure he kept some of

408
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,459
that information

409
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:24,720
last week we order a pizza on the

410
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:29,330
internet and a certain point I told him

411
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:32,880
I am taking my smartphone to check my

412
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:38,090
inbox beak and he was why are you

413
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:41,580
receiving some message when you pay

414
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:45,120
online and I was trying to explain to

415
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:47,928
him that since we are using digital

416
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:52,649
money I need to receive a confirmation

417
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:57,080
text to know that that everything is

418
00:26:52,650 --> 00:27:00,360
secured we are obsessed with how long

419
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,720
children can spend in front of a screen

420
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:10,559
in a week but the most important thing

421
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:13,980
is how long do till drone and parents to

422
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,740
spend together using that screen because

423
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:19,620
it is good to reduce the time children

424
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:23,880
spend alone in front of a screen but if

425
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:26,699
you can manage to increase the time that

426
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:32,010
families all together spent in front of

427
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:36,179
screen let's imagine a 14 year old girl

428
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:39,840
showing you your Instagram then we will

429
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:43,559
have proven that children are digital

430
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,928
natives and know how to manage risk we

431
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,710
are always going to be there thank you

432
00:27:45,929 --> 00:27:51,729
very much

433
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,729
[Applause]

434
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,729
[Applause]

435
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:58,730
you
