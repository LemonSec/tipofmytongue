2
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:23,939
good afternoon well it was said well

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,698
first of all I would like to thank you

4
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,470
for the invitation but as it was said

5
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,040
I'm going to talk about online frauds

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,210
I'm going to explain some real cases of

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,059
course I'm not going to give information

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,120
about real companies when I'm going to

9
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:43,320
explain real cases about fraud phishing

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,099
and then we're going to see what the bad

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,280
guys do with the data that they obtain

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,230
well as well I've been introduced

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,110
already but I must have our security

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,468
employee in and a lady I'm an expert in

15
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:04,830
fraud and I'm starting to collaborate

16
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:06,270
with dead etcetera and Jeanne said well

17
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,020
before starting I would like to ask you

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,460
some questions

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:15,420
in order for you to reflect upon this

20
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:19,860
issue a little bit for example how many

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,200
of you use two step verification okay

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,990
great

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,360
how many of you do not have the same

24
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:32,970
password for all your accounts okay

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,100
great best then this is better than what

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,650
I thought but of course we are here in a

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,960
cyber security band maybe this is not

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,180
the same thing for everyone how many of

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,589
you change your passwords frequently

30
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,310
okay not that many people we are going

31
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,729
to see as I was saying the main come on

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,969
routes that we may find and what the bad

33
00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:01,500
guys want regardless of the fraud but

34
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:04,289
guys are always going to try to look for

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,229
things about you they want to gain your

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,509
trust you know that to obtain your

37
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,540
account numbers your data and in the end

38
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,609
your money because this is

39
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:18,019
business in the end that moves a lot of

40
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:21,470
money so there is fishing of people or

41
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:24,470
brands there are feminists that we tend

42
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:27,049
to be company for example and that say

43
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,940
that they are hiring or they are going

44
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:32,660
to pretend to be a brand that is doing a

45
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,400
campaign on whatever and they able to

46
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,829
say ok we are going to have this product

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,299
sold by a cheaper price and this is

48
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,920
where the fun starts

49
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:45,410
there may be also some criminals

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,160
pretending to be public organizations

51
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:55,310
such as the tax agency in order to do

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:03:00,049
fishing already introduced malware they

53
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:01,670
usually use a text in a link but and we

54
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:05,470
have to be very careful because with the

55
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:09,738
Social Security that was a fraud and the

56
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:14,599
there was just a text that was being

57
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:16,430
sent with a lot of typos and people

58
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:19,849
started saying that it was fishing but

59
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:23,030
in the end it was a real email it was a

60
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,858
real text also they we have the least

61
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,560
type of fraud related to attach

62
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:32,720
documents that usually have malware or

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:36,049
phishing so these will building this

64
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:40,190
will be related to a link that will end

65
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,870
up in fishing also kidnap profiles are

66
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,239
something common to their these are

67
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:50,019
criminals are stealing accounts or that

68
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:53,209
say that have access to account and then

69
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,950
from that point and from that moment on

70
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,180
they say ok if you don't want me to do

71
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,369
anything with your account you have to

72
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,650
give me the money you can do it or not

73
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:06,049
but maybe sometimes this is not real and

74
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,849
they don't even have your account leave

75
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:11,870
obtain your password through a file with

76
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:15,798
that contains many fun

77
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,930
passwords and it's not just but they

78
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,228
have your passwords it is that their

79
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,560
password has been leaked and it may be

80
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:28,669
obtained by anyone

81
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:33,130
fishing is the top number one because it

82
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:36,380
is the most frequent one and even if

83
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:39,469
everybody is familiar with it there is

84
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:44,900
always somebody who is going to fall

85
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:48,440
into that trick what do the bad guys do

86
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:52,820
with this let's say they have a lot of

87
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:56,660
free time they are bored and then they

88
00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:02,710
do whatever they want here you can see a

89
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:05,450
list of users maybe that list is useless

90
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,989
and sometimes they just do it you know

91
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:13,729
that you gain some kind of reputation

92
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:17,180
among all the bad guys they look

93
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:20,090
thanks to this fishing I obtained 1000

94
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:24,050
passwords how many can you obtain we

95
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:26,869
will also see how they sell Netflix

96
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,600
users cards and so on I don't know if

97
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,640
you can read it but on the right part it

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:38,540
says that they are selling among of

99
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:41,719
Netflix at 2 years and 3 months for 7

100
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,270
euros following a certain set of rules

101
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,910
you cannot share it you cannot change

102
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,210
the access data and you cannot change

103
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:55,130
the language of the region then you can

104
00:05:50,210 --> 00:06:03,859
pay through PayPal Bitcoin or fee as go

105
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:07,310
keys fortify accounts when account when

106
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:12,460
premium accounts have expired they

107
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:17,270
publish them then they include the name

108
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:20,630
everybody knows they had access to those

109
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:24,530
accounts as you can see they are from

110
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:27,169
May 2009 teen let's see all the more

111
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:30,500
intense fishing because I think they are

112
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:33,740
the most important attack this is a

113
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:37,930
content recovered from a real case this

114
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:41,580
in real case it extracts the

115
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:46,210
the password the IP address and the name

116
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:52,870
in this case it was a person named Malik

117
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:57,070
admin were real the entity affected was

118
00:06:52,870 --> 00:07:02,770
informed that these data were here and

119
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:06,759
they subject also there are some people

120
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:10,299
who do not Rick do not fall into the

121
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:14,430
trick I'm sure these kind of things as

122
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:20,190
you can see I am going to go after you

123
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:24,360
it says we also have very elaborated

124
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:27,430
fishin's and they came in this case I

125
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,820
don't know if you can see it says

126
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:37,720
Microsoft online.com and then the real

127
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:41,409
domain is on D which is a vulnerable

128
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,410
narrated domain and people went see the

129
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,650
lock they think it's something

130
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:52,840
legitimate however it takes you just

131
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:55,690
five minutes to add that lock let's see

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:06,280
some other fishing cases that I have

133
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:09,159
here so let's see first these massive

134
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:14,559
males they are all written in English

135
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:17,380
and they say warning ye are suspect of

136
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,830
having committed a crime the email comes

137
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:29,680
from the police and some all the weird

138
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:33,279
stuff two to four years you could send

139
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:40,330
this through email we also have another

140
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:43,750
case here Spotify for example it

141
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,420
your account has been disabled you need

142
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:50,350
to access immediately to change your

143
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:55,120
password in the end it lets you to a

144
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:57,850
fish in case of Spotify these are not

145
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:03,399
very sophisticated but there are more

146
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:08,079
elaborated ones this is from Dropbox it

147
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:10,450
says you have been sent a new shared

148
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:18,010
folder and you have to click on the link

149
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:21,640
here we have another email and here

150
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:26,769
we're going to see a real fish in case

151
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:30,579
this is a fishing by Gmail you can see

152
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:37,870
it is exactly disabled so you are here

153
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:44,319
you enter your account for example this

154
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:48,660
one your password obviously in order to

155
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:52,779
be here we would have left we would have

156
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:57,449
clicked on any link that they would have

157
00:09:52,779 --> 00:10:03,790
sent us once you enter your credentials

158
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:07,300
it takes you to the limited account but

159
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:10,270
then you see the domain and you think ok

160
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,420
no no it was the real one but it is not

161
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:16,810
the official one and if we want to go

162
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:21,130
backwards you can't because it's all a

163
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:26,380
lie because if you delete this part you

164
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:38,079
see it again and here in this phishing

165
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:43,420
case log in txt file that we could

166
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:48,420
discover includes all the victims of

167
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:53,399
this fishing we have these have become

168
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:57,849
the current cyber come that way we could

169
00:10:53,399 --> 00:11:00,510
recover the users to inform the company

170
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:04,750
about the loss of data

171
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:08,079
I also have another one from Outlook

172
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,720
which is very elaborated on the outside

173
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,479
because it really looks like the

174
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,149
official one but it is not that

175
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:21,250
elaborated you will see why do you enter

176
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:31,660
anything and it doesn't work so it makes

177
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:34,000
it more credible gmail.com and it worked

178
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,449
so if you think that's efficient that's

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,270
what you have to do so let's try to see

180
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:49,529
if it connects I translated it myself

181
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:49,529
I'm sorry for that it leads us to here

182
00:11:51,839 --> 00:12:00,520
it says that we need to add banking

183
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:03,670
accounts so we would enter the number of

184
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,730
card the name cyber camp in this case

185
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,520
the date that we can make up because it

186
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:14,470
doesn't have any checking system and the

187
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:20,410
code zero zero zero and we confirm and

188
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:28,680
in the end the limit a legitimate

189
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:33,120
website the previous case it has saved

190
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,120
the data in a file

191
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:43,790
oops

192
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:47,240
here you have them these only saves in

193
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:52,069
the last file so it's quite useless it

194
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:57,140
doesn't store all the data and fun we

195
00:12:52,070 --> 00:13:03,950
also have another case miscellaneous of

196
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:08,000
cases they say bad guys not for them to

197
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:11,270
know who checked that fishing they

198
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:18,710
control the IP addresses with the time

199
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:28,850
they entered the same ip address enters

200
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:34,820
twice ok so if my fishing was blocked at

201
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:37,450
4 p.m. the second time this user entered

202
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:43,970
the fishing it means that this person

203
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:46,580
blocked it so the next time I'm doing a

204
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:57,170
fishing I want sent it to this person to

205
00:13:46,580 --> 00:14:02,870
this IP address then this is the

206
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:06,829
credential fishing which is very similar

207
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:12,830
to the one that we saw earlier and saves

208
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:18,080
all your data for you to have an idea it

209
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:21,110
asks asks you the username password it

210
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:26,870
extracts the IP address information it

211
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:30,410
ask you a signature your credit card the

212
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:34,010
expiration date the code so they see VV

213
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:37,760
and the pin code so it extracts

214
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:40,700
absolutely everything and it says 2-step

215
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:44,839
verification so that when you receive

216
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:47,040
the SMS you think oh yeah I did this

217
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:54,720
payment through my bank

218
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:58,079
occasion but you didn't and these works

219
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:03,589
in the same way I wanted to add this one

220
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:09,359
because I found it quite funny to see

221
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:13,019
Spanish entity have this kind of fishing

222
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:20,449
however we have IP addresses from nepal

223
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:29,180
china morocco lithuania in a vulnerable

224
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:34,170
server they uploaded the key to read

225
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:38,008
they upload a zip then they open it and

226
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:42,420
you have it there and if the server's is

227
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:46,199
not well set up you can see all the

228
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:48,889
files that it contains otherwise we want

229
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:55,109
to be able to see absolutely anything I

230
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:59,490
think I have spoken too fast so I just

231
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:04,130
want to be careful because fishings are

232
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:06,480
still happening it is even more

233
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,310
complicated because they are using new

234
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,069
techniques and they can extract

235
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:17,250
absolutely everything they we need they

236
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:19,639
use user I end and I don't know what

237
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,639
else to say

238
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:30,060
people are still falling into these

239
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:34,589
tricks so we need it is true that we are

240
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:38,160
raising awareness there are people who

241
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:42,089
are claiming something is phishing and

242
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,180
sometimes and even with that people fall

243
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,800
into that so you're here you're

244
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:49,380
interested in this you like cyber

245
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,870
security because you're here but maybe

246
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:55,019
there are people who are not familiar

247
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,000
with these field and you can encourage

248
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:59,759
them too

249
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,129
get to know it maybe your grandparents

250
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,880
are not familiar with that and could

251
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:07,620
fall into a fishing case because if they

252
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,020
think their bank account has been

253
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,250
blocked they access it and then they

254
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,668
fall into the trick

255
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:20,240
we have seen some recovered information

256
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:20,240
of people who fell into a trick once

257
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,010
they used another account you know there

258
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,590
to see if that was real or not

259
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:36,900
so with two different accounts they fell

260
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:41,428
into the same the same phishing trick as

261
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:45,000
for the domain the same they can buy a

262
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:48,750
domain which is almost exactly the same

263
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,500
as the company domain so if you read it

264
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,330
fast you don't see the typo and you

265
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,200
think it is the official one but it's

266
00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:00,928
not another thing that happens is that

267
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:04,350
people buy a Google ad although they are

268
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:09,169
usually dis activated quite fast and

269
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:13,199
then you click on it and it is not your

270
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:16,320
bank account one that you were that do

271
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,490
you were looking for as for passwords

272
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:24,210
they they are useless for them they

273
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:28,650
licked them and then you find some

274
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:32,010
collections of passwords or of 1.2

275
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:34,830
billion passwords that's why you need to

276
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:39,870
change passwords I know you don't want

277
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:43,080
to because it's lame to do it but if you

278
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:45,418
change it frequently you will have no

279
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,620
problem I don't even know my passwords

280
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:52,110
because I have access to my applications

281
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:56,668
through my smart phone however if I want

282
00:18:52,110 --> 00:19:01,559
to use my laptop to use my gmail account

283
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:06,380
I do not know how to access my gmail

284
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:09,100
from another device if five minutes of

285
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:16,390
tedious tasks

286
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:20,289
five minutes it is not as much so I just

287
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:23,110
wanted to offer you my contribution and

288
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:26,129
if you follow my recommendation I will

289
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:31,059
be land if you don't I won't care

290
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:34,059
nothing will happen but it is good to

291
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:37,539
raise awareness but it is not reaching

292
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:40,980
all the population so if you can access

293
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:43,419
you have access to elderly people

294
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:48,450
obviously they are not going to come to

295
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:51,490
cyber convoy but maybe you can send them

296
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:54,309
video for them to watch it in their new

297
00:19:51,490 --> 00:20:03,240
smartphone so that's all thank you very

298
00:19:54,309 --> 00:20:09,840
much thank you very much I don't know if

299
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,840
anyone has a question for lease Oh No

300
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:28,250
thank you very much for your

301
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:33,470
presentation I think the loiter rings a

302
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:37,670
bell as a consultancy firm but also as a

303
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:41,800
master in cybersecurity so I guess the

304
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:49,850
loiter has very talented people right

305
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:50,570
thank you very much is there any more

306
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:56,290
questions

307
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:56,290
oh yeah there is one more over there

308
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:06,470
good afternoon my name is missus I would

309
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:11,000
like to say hi why are you highlighting

310
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:17,150
fishing when it is being discarded and

311
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:21,680
now vision with V is more used vision is

312
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:25,610
made through voice calls so we're moving

313
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:28,730
from fishing to listen so why aren't you

314
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:33,340
informing more about vision because it

315
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:37,640
is my frequent yes vision is

316
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:39,770
increasingly used the the other day I

317
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,110
received a call from Microsoft and I

318
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:45,710
think it was a vision it is true that

319
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:50,810
they can try to trick you through a

320
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:53,720
voice call instead of email but I do not

321
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:57,700
think fishing is that eradicated there

322
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:02,870
are several cases of efficient every day

323
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:04,160
against a same entity and every we see

324
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:08,120
that they are more and more

325
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:11,360
sophisticated and there are several

326
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:15,620
there are many of them there are some

327
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:20,750
servers which upload the kid and there

328
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:24,169
are others which upload fishing in a

329
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:27,820
Russian server for a very long time and

330
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:30,430
