3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:17,419
good afternoon first of all I apologize

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,340
for the technical issues that we've had

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:26,099
but we're trying going to try and solve

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:28,769
them as we go along the presentation or

7
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,509
workshop that we have prepared because

8
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:34,170
there will be a practical side to this

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:39,750
this afternoon it will be about OS int

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:42,960
and social engineering and these two

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,649
concepts the Hat we don't associate them

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,559
directly but they do have a lot of

13
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,640
common aspects and that's what we're

14
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,930
going to comment here this afternoon

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,420
report or I'd also like to thank in

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,359
theory and for the jury for selecting

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:05,610
our proposal and thank all of you for

18
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:08,760
being here of course weekly I've just

19
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:13,049
like to introduce us my name is Ethan T

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:17,270
Agee lay down I am a partner and founder

21
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:23,030
of the of a company that works in

22
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,030
telecommunications it was set up in 2010

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,750
after the boom of the dot-com companies

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,409
and at the time security especially here

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,530
in Spain was something that practically

26
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:48,979
did not exist in the professional world

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:53,009
I began there in 2006 a founded a

28
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:56,009
capital risk company to do with it

29
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,780
development and here in in Phoebe we

30
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,570
have a hackathon and I'm a member of

31
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,960
that jury and that's a very much related

32
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:06,148
to development especially in free

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:12,379
software and giving something back to

34
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:13,860
the community these are open source

35
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,200
projects doesn't mean

36
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,690
that they're not quality projects for

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,720
the professional world we use them very

38
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:26,670
often and they are very great quality

39
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:31,470
projects we also have catalysis there

40
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:37,200
those here he is part of the team in

41
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:39,420
Internet Security auditors and I'm sure

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,450
you are all you all know who he is

43
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,000
already since he has done a lot in terms

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,480
of research and in the world of

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,820
intelligence as well he's very well

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,869
known in the field of terrorism and so

47
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,549
on but you will see that he his

48
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,320
knowledge covers many different

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:04,130
industries we're going to try and do a

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,500
practical workshop here this afternoon

51
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:11,130
but obviously we need to put this into

52
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:15,410
context we're not going to in going to

53
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:20,400
go into a great deal of detail because

54
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:21,690
we've been doing courses on this for

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,850
some time now but we're just going to

56
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:29,820
give a few different ideas it's about

57
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,250
the world of OS int linked to social

58
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,640
engineering and not from the offensive

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,519
point of view but with regard but the

60
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,190
measures that we can take in order to

61
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:48,510
defend ourselves from the attacks that

62
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:52,680
we're going to see a positive use of

63
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,720
what we're going to be commenting there

64
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,769
will be a short introduction during

65
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,769
which the catalyst will set the context

66
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:11,730
and where OS int come see and what is

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:15,000
the value of OS int pretty much we'll

68
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,459
talk about the types of attacks that we

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,350
are subjected to because we've been

70
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,269
talking about this for several weeks now

71
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,140
and we're going to talk about social

72
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,720
engineering as well we'll speak briefly

73
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,780
about this

74
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,920
because I'm sure everybody here knows a

75
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,169
lot about this con this subject but

76
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:44,510
we're going to use a different OS int

77
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:47,290
techniques in order to exploit the the

78
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:51,590
confidence the people place in social

79
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,510
networks and this will take us to the

80
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,710
last part which is about the best

81
00:04:53,510 --> 00:05:00,080
practices in this field first of all

82
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,340
thank you for being here at 4 o'clock in

83
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:09,530
the afternoon let us begin by taking a

84
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:13,609
look at this first screen which we have

85
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:16,489
an indication of the developments over

86
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:21,800
the last few years in terms of attacks

87
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:25,010
in different in the country this shows

88
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,810
the main concerns that different

89
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:32,830
countries have how tis evolved since

90
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:36,700
2012 when it was not such a great

91
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:43,510
concern in different countries - now to

92
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:47,570
2019 and there are different attacks

93
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:51,620
2014 that increased significantly 2015

94
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:55,330
it almost went away 2016 once again it

95
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,680
was a little bit concerning to to leakes

96
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,200
2017 things became a little bit more

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,550
serious and attacks and fraud could be a

98
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:09,250
significant concern for stability in

99
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:13,520
countries and now it has been

100
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:19,760
consolidated as an attack for countries

101
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:23,060
on the whole in Spain for example we had

102
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,900
to update the strategy for security in

103
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,090
the country and based on the background

104
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,060
and the speed which with which things

105
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:35,438
were changing there was a need for a

106
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:38,199
national security plan

107
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:40,939
and we'll talk a little bit about that

108
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:44,299
we'll talk about Snyder space as is

109
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:50,139
common space the threats and challenges

110
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:52,459
at the cyber space the proposals and

111
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,649
specifically we are concerned with the

112
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:56,329
threats and the challenges in cyberspace

113
00:06:54,649 --> 00:07:01,360
and that's what we're going to be

114
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:04,519
talking about afternoon in this workshop

115
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,979
why have things changed and why we have

116
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:09,139
these concerns there are a number of

117
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:12,529
characteristics that we will see and

118
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:14,629
these have created this boom if you can

119
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:19,819
call it that first of all there's a

120
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:23,179
financial cost if you would like to in

121
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,949
fact or a fact webpage or remove a

122
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:31,339
system you don't actually need a lot of

123
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:35,929
money in order to be able to do that and

124
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:39,079
furthermore if you wanted to avoid a

125
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:41,149
competitor actually coming to and

126
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:43,459
physically attacking you or they had to

127
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:45,469
do a to put a bit of silicone in the

128
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:48,099
lock and to stop somebody actually

129
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:52,129
coming and attacking your physical

130
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:54,110
facilities but now we have things in the

131
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,509
cloud or anything on the net we don't

132
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,309
actually need a physical location in

133
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:04,069
order to be able to do and attack that

134
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:09,499
kind we also now how the huge number of

135
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:12,529
tools that are available any of the

136
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:16,069
available platforms have number of tools

137
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:19,459
that can attack how a security such as

138
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:24,799
on get happen they can damage us

139
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:26,959
significantly so at the same time as we

140
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:30,289
have this boom in the kind of tools that

141
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:34,188
are available online there has also been

142
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:36,740
a number of simple tools and we can even

143
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:39,799
find on YouTube a number of manuals of

144
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,899
how to work with these tools we don't

145
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,149
even really need to know how they work

146
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,280
we just go to a tutorial a video

147
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:50,320
tutorial and follow the steps

148
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,319
this didn't used to happen

149
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,120
cybercriminals had to set up their their

150
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,560
own systems many years ago but that's

151
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:05,500
not the case now obviously the effect of

152
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:09,739
an attack is a huge a simple email can

153
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,530
stop a company from functioning and so

154
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:17,990
these attacks have an ability to have a

155
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:19,510
big impact there's a reduced risk for

156
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:24,650
the attacker

157
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:27,650
there are anonymous networks therefore

158
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:30,439
most attackers have a sense of false

159
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:37,100
security that they can work as they wish

160
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:40,610
and be totally anonymous security forces

161
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:46,010
in Spain a very competent and that's not

162
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:50,800
really the case here in Spain so what we

163
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:53,240
have now is cybercrime as a service

164
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,240
people who specialize in different

165
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,260
techniques and they work with other

166
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,400
people you don't need to know about

167
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:04,130
everything around a month ago in a

168
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,199
telegram channel dealing with this there

169
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:09,290
was a little group that was saying hey

170
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,270
I'm a specialist in ransomware I'm

171
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,520
looking for people who can give me

172
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,949
domains that might be vulnerable and

173
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,140
we'll come to an agreement for every

174
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:22,370
domain that you give me I'll give you a

175
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:25,790
percent of what I'm earning so neither

176
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,290
even bother to scan web pages or

177
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,719
services in order to obtain the

178
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,610
information they come to agreements you

179
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,930
do the scanning I'll do this bit and

180
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:39,200
they come to an agreement plus we have

181
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:43,280
now have a hyper connectivity in our

182
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,640
lives we have two three maybe telephones

183
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,189
or even our our things that we have at

184
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,230
home are all connected so we have hyper

185
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:56,620
connectivity in our lives and this is

186
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,620
leading to over exposure to attacks

187
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,870
last of all what we also have is that

188
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,150
just until a few years ago when we were

189
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:10,510
talk about conflict we were talking

190
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:15,150
about four areas we were talking about

191
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:18,460
war or conflict the earth sea space or

192
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:23,380
and they could easily identify these

193
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,850
attacks but now what we have in cyber

194
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,439
attacks is something completely

195
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:33,580
different what you can see here on the

196
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,110
screen is an idea of the characteristics

197
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,030
of the of the actors that could be

198
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,430
evolved in cyberattacks

199
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,040
so the cyber space isn't actually a

200
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:47,050
domain it's a transversal domain any

201
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:50,740
activity can be related to this this is

202
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:55,630
why it is so very difficult to attribute

203
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:57,370
an attack to a person or to a country it

204
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:03,550
depends on the different states of the

205
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:05,950
of the attacks so based on this we can

206
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,859
even come to the conclusion or to

207
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:11,410
understand that there is a sixth domain

208
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:16,300
versus sixth domain which is the

209
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:20,699
cognitive one we are being used in other

210
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:25,750
words we are being used for

211
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,700
misinformation for rumors and the

212
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,250
information the activity that we go

213
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,980
through is needed in order to carry out

214
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,200
attacks during the last elections during

215
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,850
the elections in the US and even in

216
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:43,270
brexit this is evidence it's the

217
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,730
influence of of information on the

218
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:49,449
citizens in order to select brexit for

219
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,910
example so moving on to social

220
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:56,140
engineering then what do we understand

221
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:58,329
by this social engineering a simple

222
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:03,340
definition of social engineering would

223
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:05,200
be when a person makes us do or not do

224
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,170
something that we would not have done by

225
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:11,570
ourselves

226
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:13,939
como parte de diferentes well if we have

227
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:18,740
a look at this image on here you'll be

228
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:21,920
able to see it clearly these are complex

229
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:25,210
now we have more complex systems they're

230
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,459
more difficult to penetrate and if I

231
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:35,680
can't penetrate a system I'll go to the

232
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:35,680
weakest side and who is that it's people

233
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:42,830
if I want to get close to somebody it's

234
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,690
very easy to get close to that click to

235
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:49,280
what I need in order to carry out my

236
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:53,680
attack so within image social

237
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,680
engineering we have hunting and farming

238
00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:00,800
in terms of social and entering the the

239
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,000
capacity the that we have in order to

240
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,650
carry out a direct or indirect attack

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:14,780
but I don't want to extend on this too

242
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:17,270
much in the words of kevin Mitnick i

243
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:22,850
don't know if you know of him he was the

244
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:28,040
first social engineer he based his work

245
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:31,270
on four main points there are four

246
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:36,520
points through which we can be attacked

247
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:40,610
the first point is we all want to help

248
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:44,480
second point is that when we get to know

249
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,910
some somebody we always confide in that

250
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,640
person and feel close to that person and

251
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:51,319
the third it's also we also find it very

252
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,870
hard to say no when somebody asks

253
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,180
something of us they ask us a favor we

254
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,420
say yes because we feel like we can't

255
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:04,189
say no and so attackers make the most of

256
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:06,020
those kinds of situations when somebody

257
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:09,050
asks you where to go how to get

258
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:11,980
somewhere for example you tend to help

259
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:15,589
him you just give them the right answer

260
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,500
and of course last of all everybody

261
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,220
likes

262
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:23,040
have something nice said about them oh

263
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,480
hi you're clever you are and how lovely

264
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,870
you are

265
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,780
that brings down our defenses and all of

266
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:36,120
those elements take us to a point where

267
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:39,380
it makes it more easy for us to be now

268
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:43,320
we'll talk a little bit about OS int but

269
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:51,600
will allow beef NT to come in at this

270
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:56,330
point so we'll talk about OS int I'm

271
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,220
sure that if you've come into this room

272
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:01,410
many of you will have heard of OS int

273
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:09,120
open source intelligence it's been

274
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:11,459
around for a few years with many new

275
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:19,470
innovations it began in within the

276
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:22,320
military field in 1941 when the FBI s

277
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,900
was set up before this was before their

278
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,590
CIA

279
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:32,370
American intelligence the idea was to

280
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:34,560
monitor foreign communication systems

281
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:38,660
and to follow what they were doing that

282
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,660
was already what we call OSI enmity

283
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:46,740
we've been using open sources since that

284
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:50,430
time to obtain information to process it

285
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,380
and to give us some of the registers

286
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:56,040
that so we've been talking about look

287
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:59,160
it's a dlc so this is what oh I oh s int

288
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:07,699
is all about and of course it's related

289
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:10,649
to public information we often say that

290
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:13,490
information is the petroleum of this

291
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:16,500
century or information is power

292
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:20,670
information is not power intelligence is

293
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,980
power information on its own it needs a

294
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,839
little bit more we needs intelligence

295
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,040
and that's what we're going to try and

296
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,740
see here today there's a short video

297
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,570
here

298
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:37,210
we can see it as community just for one

299
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:41,559
minute and I'll hope it'll serve as an

300
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,179
introduction it'll be a necessity these

301
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,510
days

302
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:49,240
kinder he didn't live as tienda de la

303
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:53,770
musica his co-chairs in periodico

304
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:57,540
Kelly's package is the clothes you're

305
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:01,179
wearing the newspaper that you're eating

306
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:04,420
photos that you put online the children

307
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:08,800
you have who decides all of this the

308
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:11,260
party that you vote for this who decides

309
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,700
what you need look at the blue Koopa

310
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,580
what makes you fall in love

311
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,410
what worries who decides what kind of

312
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,480
person you want to be who decides for

313
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,480
you who decides for us

314
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,900
[Music]

315
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,120
boy they can no say need to need your

316
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,200
happiness perhaps it's not me no you

317
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,120
there you know someone real integrity

318
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,550
but we have to understand that perhaps

319
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,139
we are not entirely free but

320
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:52,330
understanding this is perhaps the only

321
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:57,160
way of actually being free this is very

322
00:18:52,330 --> 00:19:01,439
interesting the decisions that we take

323
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:05,440
and the the impact that that has on us

324
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,320
and in fact there is actually an advert

325
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,710
it's actually telling us that you're not

326
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,379
actually free this is what we're talking

327
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,620
about in the previous point making the

328
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:24,850
most of others and manipulating

329
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:26,320
different techniques and information and

330
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,250
I were talking on the train yesterday

331
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:34,149
from Barcelona and we were working and

332
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:36,010
at one point I connected and looked F at

333
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:40,000
the film that was going on in the train

334
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:42,340
at the time and it was just talking

335
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,090
about information at the point it was in

336
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,850
like a supermarket he went to the

337
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:51,070
supermarket and you bought what he

338
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:53,679
wanted to buy but perhaps you being

339
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:56,950
guided - what - you were being bought

340
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:02,050
what you were buying because of the

341
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:03,640
information that they were input how

342
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,100
many of you are going to buy something

343
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,660
on Black Friday or maybe you've already

344
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,820
done it since perhaps it's not something

345
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,630
you actually need but you want to make

346
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,629
the most of that opportunity

347
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:22,000
so we receive a great deal of

348
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:25,090
information and we're going in to the

349
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,800
point of hacking in and ethics here but

350
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:31,060
what is this all about is about

351
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:34,800
information and data this happens in

352
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:38,320
just a minute on the internet nowadays

353
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,690
there are over 4 million searches in

354
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:46,009
Google

355
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:48,619
many many messages 42 million and 90,000

356
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:52,129
tweets and all of this information that

357
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:55,369
we generate is being exploited by

358
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:58,009
somebody there is nothing that is for

359
00:20:55,369 --> 00:21:04,039
free we have to understand and we have

360
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:06,259
to understand this and accept it people

361
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:08,269
don't invest a lot of money in different

362
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:12,769
applications so that we can just enjoy

363
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:14,659
and have fun they know who our contacts

364
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:17,419
are how many how many hours we spend

365
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:21,919
using the application what our network

366
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:25,039
is a load of data that is available and

367
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,669
it is moved and used by large companies

368
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:31,639
and purchased by other parties and sold

369
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:33,769
on to third parties but we're not going

370
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:38,869
to go into detail on that we're going to

371
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:41,590
stick with what we're talking about all

372
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:45,220
the information that way giving and

373
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:47,599
publicizing companies have mechanisms in

374
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,629
order to be able to use this and as we

375
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,789
will see as we go on in the presentation

376
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:55,099
there are also another group of people

377
00:21:52,789 --> 00:22:00,109
who are criminals and who make the most

378
00:21:55,099 --> 00:22:02,899
of that information talking about the

379
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:05,779
FBI s which was the predecessor of CIA

380
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:09,109
and we were talking about that earlier

381
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:11,869
but then CIA says that the percentage of

382
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:17,269
the information that information

383
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:19,759
agencies create nowadays is in its

384
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,259
greatest majority taken from publicly

385
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,779
available information so that you

386
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:26,960
understand the real weight of these

387
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:29,659
sources who works oh is int just to get

388
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,369
into context there's no specific

389
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:35,269
definition there's no clear definition

390
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:38,238
there are different approaches to talk

391
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:41,139
about say so I think too that we have

392
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:42,349
here on the screen the ones which are

393
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:44,508
closest

394
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:46,970
it's basically generating intelligence

395
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:52,059
from information gathered from publicly

396
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:52,059
available sources yeah

397
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:58,000
it's been processed and it's been

398
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,059
treated in a way that it has allowed us

399
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,640
to generate an intelligence products

400
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:06,399
fulfills the needs that have been

401
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:09,490
expressed before and that we are

402
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:12,908
transmitted in time and to the people

403
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:15,549
that wants that information because

404
00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:19,350
creating a quality product is worthless

405
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:22,179
if we didn't hand it in in time

406
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:26,370
sometimes it has lower quality but you

407
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:29,080
do hand it in on time it is more useful

408
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:31,719
rather than whether it's worth it if you

409
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,120
talk about a potential terrorist attack

410
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,890
after it has been perpetrated than

411
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,809
there's no use so obvious int is a

412
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,880
discipline of intelligence there are

413
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:45,070
many disciplines within the field of

414
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,309
intelligence or tsiyon team maybe one of

415
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,889
the oldest but we talk about geospatial

416
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:53,620
intelligence there's something that

417
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:57,010
started being talked about in 2005 came

418
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:59,620
from the US and it taps into everything

419
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:02,730
that has to do with intelligence based

420
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:06,580
on image analysis spectral analysis

421
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:13,690
concerning human activity in specific

422
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:16,960
geographical areas you see humans as

423
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,789
well human intelligence which is even

424
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,470
older than ours int and this is

425
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:23,529
information that has been gathered

426
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:26,110
through human and sources of spear notch

427
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,510
as we know it information that has been

428
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:30,820
gathered through interrogations all

429
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:33,730
through witnesses would have testified

430
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:36,879
in specifics in scenario you have also

431
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:38,200
financial cyber intelligence corporate

432
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,740
intelligence you have as many

433
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,450
disciplines as you can and so what is

434
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:47,159
the issues because if we're talking

435
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:49,840
about a rasayan T which outsources

436
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:52,990
everyone has access to both of you

437
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,490
it isn't it's beautiful because all that

438
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,059
easy because otherwise everyone would be

439
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,129
an information or intelligence analyst

440
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:03,178
there are three main issues that we have

441
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:05,158
summarized here perhaps its greatest

442
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,279
advantage is also its greatest fault

443
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,710
it's an excess of information there's so

444
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:13,230
much information that finding quality

445
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:16,740
information is like finding a needle in

446
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:18,720
a haystack so you have to be very

447
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,529
accurate or more young one because you

448
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,049
don't have unlimited time to select your

449
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:28,009
sources carefully you have to very high

450
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:32,519
because there's another issue might be

451
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:37,440
information that is wrong oh that is you

452
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:40,200
know intensely being made wrong some

453
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,820
people might actually give informations

454
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,490
that is fake so that we actually draw or

455
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:53,490
focus our attention on that information

456
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:55,740
which is and what's the right sources

457
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,559
whether they are so to see you can trust

458
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,179
or not because when we gather

459
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,779
information for example from social

460
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:08,009
networks that is source of information

461
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:14,249
so it's new spaces the minutes of

462
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:16,369
Congress or a radio program any kind of

463
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:19,230
information that is probably leave

464
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:21,389
accessible and I'm not talking about

465
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:24,419
free information doesn't have to be free

466
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:27,330
but it is information that everyone can

467
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:29,039
have access to even if it's paying all

468
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,009
via a subscription or anything of the

469
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:35,158
sort

470
00:26:31,009 --> 00:26:37,619
if it's legal so even if you have to pay

471
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:41,909
for it then it would be the sources that

472
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:44,279
we're talking about sometimes we need to

473
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:47,460
verify we cannot just trust any source

474
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:51,149
because that so could be giving us fake

475
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:56,700
information so we always need to check

476
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:58,129
and double-check we have to contrast the

477
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:02,810
information that we get

478
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:08,270
from information just a little apart

479
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:09,830
when we talk about information with

480
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,430
things that it might be countries or

481
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:15,620
organizations who ready but sometimes

482
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:19,760
it's actually a business owner who wants

483
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:21,679
to disappear from Google because they

484
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,800
don't want for people to talk about that

485
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,390
they just fill the net with wrong

486
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,980
information so that people draw their

487
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,810
attention to that you forget about what

488
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,030
they have done which they don't want

489
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:36,440
people to talk about as we were saying

490
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:41,660
information sources can be very varied

491
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:44,110
and this takes us to the cycle and with

492
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:47,540
this we're going to finish this

493
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:49,270
presentation so generating intelligence

494
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,590
is not an anarchic

495
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:55,370
process we don't know what status from

496
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:57,470
anywhere and finished just anywhere but

497
00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:00,290
rather there are stages this is a

498
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,900
theoretical model then every time we

499
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:09,470
adapted to our needs for example CIA has

500
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:14,650
five stages other entities have four

501
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:14,650
stages so that you have definitely one

502
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:24,639
planning phase which is phase number one

503
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:27,800
we ask the questions we need to

504
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,320
priorities are going to be the different

505
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,070
contexts that we have with additional

506
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,560
information we have as well and that's

507
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,070
when we start selecting sources where

508
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:43,700
are we going to get our information from

509
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:46,730
and by is the second stage acquiring

510
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,620
information this is very important

511
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:54,260
because as we are saying earlier we need

512
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:56,870
to find sources of check sources and we

513
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,960
will need ultimate aid for tools that

514
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:03,020
allow us to gather all this information

515
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,000
and of course we will need to process

516
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,830
that information

517
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,200
because you may be getting information

518
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:11,169
from a Russian portal and because we

519
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,330
didn't speak Russian we need to get that

520
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:15,040
information translated search gathering

521
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,560
more information does not necessarily

522
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,530
means that we have a higher quality

523
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,090
product sometimes it's actually in our

524
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,490
detriment because the more information

525
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:29,399
we have the more time we will to process

526
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:33,430
that information the next stage is

527
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,250
getting all the information together we

528
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:41,680
have to import that information so that

529
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:43,720
it has easy to interpret by the analyst

530
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,980
and that's how we get on to the next

531
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,290
stage which is and that is where our

532
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,850
analysts play a real important role

533
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:56,980
because they are the ones to have to put

534
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:58,480
together all the pieces and draw the

535
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,830
conclusions that they will then have to

536
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:07,750
report to the decision maker this is a

537
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:10,600
cycle that goes on and on and on all the

538
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,310
time and on the first stage when we are

539
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,649
acquiring information we have to source

540
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,240
a huge decision maker to see if the

541
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,650
information the way gathering is the

542
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,340
right one or whether we need to find

543
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:27,040
resources and I'm talking about the

544
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:33,250
cycle here we've seen six stages as

545
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:36,250
within the was saying this can vary but

546
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:39,580
remember that the first form status as

547
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:42,910
we will see now being used by

548
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,230
cybercriminals as well they also obtain

549
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,600
information they process that

550
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:49,000
information so this cycle is not only

551
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:56,310
for agencies cyber criminals do use this

552
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:00,340
cycle as well yes indeed used to be

553
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:03,850
before and more manual job and not so

554
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:08,530
accurate because analysts before used to

555
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:11,909
work as we saw in TV programs they they

556
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:15,430
work we have their blackboards and flow

557
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:20,800
charts that they did by hand there

558
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:23,590
we used before the relationships that we

559
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,990
could figure out before were much less

560
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:29,290
than we can do now because our dates we

561
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:31,900
can have a really accurate analysis and

562
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,300
find quality information about any

563
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:37,120
objectives year to person a company as

564
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,909
we will see after work and that we find

565
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,399
as well in cybercrime because before

566
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:45,670
when they launched their attacks we have

567
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,540
the famous Nigerian letters that were

568
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:53,470
coming to any domain but now we're

569
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:56,170
finding that the attacks are targeted to

570
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:59,560
a specific company they do a study and

571
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:01,030
they go directly to target that company

572
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:06,790
and they know exactly how they have to

573
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:10,389
process the information we're saying

574
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:15,420
it's not just full intelligence agencies

575
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:18,130
it's not just for NSA or C&I or Mossad

576
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:22,930
anyone with the tools that we have

577
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:26,110
nowadays available to us at home we can

578
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:33,730
obtain information which is extremely

579
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:37,000
sensitive about any objective this is

580
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:39,130
tapped into actively levels we will talk

581
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,010
about this later but one of the things

582
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:44,380
is what we can do ourselves at home

583
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:48,310
about the information that we have made

584
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:50,680
available publicly detect which of that

585
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,720
information is actually sensitive and

586
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:56,680
which part of this information we don't

587
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,300
want to have published at all so we

588
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,650
would have an objective which could be a

589
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:04,419
person and company or a groups people or

590
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:10,170
could use for escape these are the main

591
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:14,110
objectives that do your work so when we

592
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:16,930
fly o with int techniques what we do is

593
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:19,360
to try and obtain as much information as

594
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,070
possible about these objectives and in

595
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,169
order to do that we have different tools

596
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:29,220
if we don't do that yes and many of them

597
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,220
are actually okay

598
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:37,899
no it's just clear the with the growth

599
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:41,450
of social networks there was an

600
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:43,970
explosion of information as we were

601
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:47,750
saying in the infographics before we are

602
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:50,150
generating an amount of information was

603
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,590
unthinkable before we creating more

604
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,200
information now that we have ever

605
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:57,199
created in the history of humankind and

606
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,570
we now have tools to make this

607
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,390
information acquisition automatic and

608
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:05,510
actually in real time we can process the

609
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:07,520
information that we're acquiring because

610
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,120
I didn't today it's all about analyzing

611
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:14,509
this information and obtaining as much

612
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:16,279
information because the more information

613
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:23,149
we have the more efficient our attack

614
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:26,169
will be if you wanted to rob a bank you

615
00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:29,779
would not just wake up one day get your

616
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:31,190
balaclava and go to the to the bank you

617
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,139
wouldn't be very successful if you

618
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,360
really wanted to rob a bank what you

619
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:38,270
would do is go a couple times to that

620
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,240
Langevin several times during months

621
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:46,489
even you would locate the accesses in

622
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:50,060
previous exits CCTV cameras the

623
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:52,129
scheduled opening hours the schedule of

624
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:55,250
the security personnel so you you would

625
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:57,139
do research proper research and this

626
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,870
this is exactly what we do in the

627
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:02,720
virtual world and the more information

628
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:06,380
and the more patient and the more time

629
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,600
at the attacker hats the more they will

630
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,180
know about us and obviously this will

631
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:15,799
also depend on the objective because

632
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:17,660
even cyber criminal targets someone they

633
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,200
will already know whether they are going

634
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,560
to need an email or whether they will

635
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,899
need information about that personal

636
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,090
organization social networks or from

637
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:32,030
their family and this is what is going

638
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,800
to set the guide lengths of the way

639
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:38,360
we're going to acquire information about

640
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,810
that objective at the end of the day

641
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:45,850
well we are telling you right now

642
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:48,040
there's no magic it's no draw a wand and

643
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:54,420
get as much information about someone as

644
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:58,390
we can rather as we're going to see now

645
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:01,210
we have tools available to everyone

646
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:04,270
nowadays that will allow us to obtain

647
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,920
information or cybercriminals can

648
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,830
actually obtain information about apps

649
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:14,290
and can tap into that information and

650
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:19,540
use it against approach what we usually

651
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:25,630
do is use some of the different search

652
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:28,000
engine engines because we started a bit

653
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,640
later we're going to do this a bit quick

654
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:36,190
quicker than we were going to do it

655
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,440
before here we go for example one of the

656
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,590
things that we always look to bear in

657
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,480
mind and this is very important when you

658
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:45,370
launch a search about an objective and

659
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,880
this is what the cyber criminals do as

660
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:53,500
well I was saying first of all what you

661
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,480
do is you open for different browsers in

662
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,940
these different browsers we're going to

663
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,270
get different information what does this

664
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,310
say mean it means that when we want to

665
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,680
find information which is relevant in

666
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:09,279
this case for cyber criminals or just to

667
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:11,410
assess our over expectations on the

668
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,740
internet this is very relevant for

669
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:19,509
example we have looked at Rodrigo rato

670
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,629
came to mind as you can see we see

671
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:26,800
Wikipedia

672
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:29,650
lpena minuto Z's our newspapers if we do

673
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,350
it if we launch a search on bing we get

674
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,700
wikipedia as well but after that the

675
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:37,750
results are can be really different to

676
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:40,509
the ones that we had before how many of

677
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:43,390
you actually go over than the second

678
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:46,570
page some people will but in general our

679
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:48,910
people do the first second and third

680
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:51,370
page maximum and they didn't keep on

681
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:53,470
going and this is why it's important to

682
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:56,490
have some flexibility when looking for

683
00:37:53,470 --> 00:38:00,810
information with Yandex for example

684
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:03,700
Yandex is a specific search engine for

685
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:08,500
Eastern European countries and Russia

686
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:10,180
and this actually gives us results that

687
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,220
have nothing to do with all the others

688
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,839
and that's another search engine that I

689
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:18,180
really like I don't know if you know it

690
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:22,540
it's called carrot when we launch

691
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:25,990
searches here we can group the results

692
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:30,960
even if we have about 300 links in our

693
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:30,959
results what it does first of all is to

694
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:42,029
see everything grouped for example we

695
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:45,490
have monkey here then we have I am in

696
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:48,130
chief for example so I don't have to go

697
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:50,830
over all the results because I have the

698
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,780
results group my subject so I can go

699
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,299
directly to the file that I am

700
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,250
interested in and I will get on the

701
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,670
right hand side all the results that are

702
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:05,460
related to that category that the search

703
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:08,740
engine and then we also have a month

704
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:13,530
visualization and it is grouped by

705
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:17,580
subgroups according to what the engine

706
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:19,540
thinks it's more relevant to our search

707
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:22,660
visit this is really good for

708
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,730
presentations and infographics but as

709
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,310
you can see we even have a second sub

710
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:30,849
level to obtain information in this case

711
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,589
about this person yeah if we're looking

712
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:34,780
for information about someone who has a

713
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:38,049
very common name for example we could

714
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,790
okay cost results from many different

715
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,460
people but if we know that they have a

716
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,920
specific position in an organization

717
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,369
then we can at that and with here just

718
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,190
with a click we can locate the kind of

719
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:53,800
person and this also obviously the

720
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:55,330
boolean operators and we're not going to

721
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,790
go into them although they're really

722
00:39:55,330 --> 00:40:00,848
interested but we don't have time today

723
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:03,029
really but you say you know they're

724
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:06,750
really useful

725
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:11,220
kind of searches said because we were

726
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:15,120
looking information about someone who is

727
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:20,609
related to the business world man in

728
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:22,890
this case if we want to get to a company

729
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:27,300
or an organization there are different

730
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:33,900
pages in this case for example this is

731
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:37,020
we have I don't know if you know it but

732
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:41,070
what this page does is to download and

733
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:47,220
index the content of woman which is the

734
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:49,770
official diary of company's registry in

735
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,540
Spain every time there's a new person

736
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,720
coming into the companies and one being

737
00:40:51,540 --> 00:41:01,170
inside everything is registered here in

738
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:04,259
the central company's registry even ID

739
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:06,870
number this is a paid source of

740
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,350
information bits publicly available so

741
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:13,859
with this site we just type a name and

742
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:20,460
it gives us information in this case for

743
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:23,220
example among exclusive information

744
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,220
about all the positions that he has

745
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:28,950
helped and this is information it would

746
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:32,250
be more difficult to obtain from other

747
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:38,730
sources I think we've lost the

748
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:44,910
presentation I feel we had had the same

749
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:46,920
thing that happens in Malaga well as we

750
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:50,970
were saying our portfolios are in a

751
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,830
castle if we start looking into the

752
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,830
information that we get we see that he

753
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,960
sell different positions in detects but

754
00:41:55,830 --> 00:42:00,060
then if we go onto Inditex and we see

755
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,400
the board of Inditex being sample so if

756
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,049
we wanted to have a specific scam to do

757
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,530
with Inditex or if you wanted to know

758
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:08,550
who the

759
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:10,920
Sanjiv account or yearly accountant in

760
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:15,600
de texas then this kind of to would be

761
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:20,310
really really useful in order to see it

762
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:23,750
in graphic format I wasn't sure if we

763
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,750
were going to be able to do this or not

764
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:32,069
we have this search engine in which the

765
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:36,330
results are very very visual because one

766
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:39,210
of the things we mentioned beforehand is

767
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:41,040
that I don't know if you can see here we

768
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:44,160
have a month you or figure in the middle

769
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,970
and then around him we say that he has a

770
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:51,810
connection to five different companies

771
00:42:46,970 --> 00:43:02,250
so I if I click that map we will get a

772
00:42:51,810 --> 00:43:05,690
graph with that information that if I

773
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:08,700
want information on a given company I

774
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:09,620
can see the elements that I'm looking

775
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:14,640
for

776
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:16,650
for example of its Family Education and

777
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:22,830
I select to the information that I am

778
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:25,290
interested in regarding that person the

779
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:31,380
information is expanded so you get new

780
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:36,210
information about that company and this

781
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:39,000
information can be very useful based on

782
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:41,250
this information I can get dated find

783
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,960
out who is responsible for the board of

784
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:47,730
directors here we have a number of keys

785
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,780
that tell us the relationship between

786
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:54,420
one and the other and on the right hand

787
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,340
side I can select depending on the type

788
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:59,730
of entity of the company I can select

789
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:02,340
what I'm interested in yes the look at

790
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:04,520
us look at my parameter as well for

791
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,520
there

792
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:15,800
tambien o cannot permit este lo que nos

793
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:20,779
per meter

794
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:23,599
este what this allows me to do is the

795
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:28,849
Libra moon is an access accessed through

796
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:32,000
the API as well so if for example I put

797
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:36,920
in a little script and it allows us to

798
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,230
text to the - Libre board me and it

799
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,829
tells us we have found one person with

800
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:47,300
this name and the base database and he

801
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:55,940
has seven current roles it gives me the

802
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:58,819
information on those different roles and

803
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:03,530
there's a historical data regarding the

804
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:06,380
companies that person has worked so in

805
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:09,020
order to do an analysis in terms of an

806
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:14,380
objective in a company then this is a

807
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:17,920
rather relevant we talked about

808
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:20,180
selecting your sources carefully and

809
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,170
also the formats in which that

810
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,609
information is provided in this case

811
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:29,060
there's an API and that's the most

812
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:32,690
direct manner but we have to develop

813
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:36,230
sometimes vectors specific tools in

814
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:38,060
order to acquire our information in

815
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:40,400
order to be able to import it onto our

816
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:44,450
platform and to give it a global

817
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,270
treatment especially this is true when

818
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:51,980
we have a lot of information it needs to

819
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:55,339
be stored in order to situate it either

820
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,630
in a database database or in Excel or

821
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:59,960
whatever system in order to be able to

822
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:02,420
then later use it let's have a look at

823
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,770
an example we can see that it's not so

824
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:11,030
easy the information we saw about radula

825
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:14,210
rag doll when I do this consultation

826
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:16,109
about him now I have five results that

827
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:19,859
could coincide with that search

828
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:22,589
so I've got five Rodrigo druthers first

829
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:24,390
of all it gives me one of them this is

830
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:30,209
the ato al Arco Rodrigo in this

831
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:32,578
particular case and based on the types

832
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:34,469
of companies that come up I know it's

833
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:41,549
there the right person the person I was

834
00:46:34,469 --> 00:46:43,979
looking for the second objective is the

835
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,579
rato figure either Rodrigo a different

836
00:46:43,979 --> 00:46:47,209
person

837
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:50,489
it says he has 24 different positions

838
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:53,190
and we see relationship with the caja

839
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:54,930
Madrid the bank in Madrid and I know

840
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,259
that perhaps this is the person I'm

841
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,259
looking for

842
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:03,930
we had relations there the list of

843
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:05,700
companies that she is no longer related

844
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:12,769
to and then down here we have director

845
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:15,749
Figueredo Rodrigo so when people

846
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:19,078
companies rent are registered on the

847
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:21,299
file there's a difference between if

848
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:24,239
this is space between one sermon surname

849
00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:26,038
and the next so if we see the next one

850
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:27,660
the next example is deer that don't eat

851
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:31,289
figured out Lord Rodriguez slight

852
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,969
difference in these surnames so when we

853
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:34,709
do the search if we only look at the

854
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:37,619
first one we probably wouldn't have

855
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:40,198
found the rest of the companies so

856
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:42,599
depending when we do these searches or

857
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:46,529
whatever - were using we have to do

858
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:55,229
combinations because there might be more

859
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:57,690
information out there we try to monitor

860
00:47:55,229 --> 00:47:59,549
ourselves even to see kind of what

861
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:04,979
information about ourselves is out then

862
00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:08,130
a third party might have access to we

863
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:10,939
have a number of keywords that we put

864
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:14,999
into Google so whenever something is

865
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:17,219
published and we get an alert on that we

866
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:19,558
need to generate different combinations

867
00:48:17,219 --> 00:48:23,910
first your name and then your surname

868
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:26,069
your surname in any name and so on

869
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:28,230
this is a piece of advice that we'll

870
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:31,710
talk about a little bit more later on we

871
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:35,490
have to get used to this we have to get

872
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:38,640
used to searching for ourselves on the

873
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:41,308
internet using our names surname using

874
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,368
our IE d reversing the name and the

875
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:47,309
surname using our current registration

876
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:48,900
number so that see if we can people

877
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:54,000
could do something against using that

878
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:56,099
information using Gmail or any other

879
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,069
kind of tool we can set up alerts and

880
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:01,710
set up different combinations for this

881
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:03,690
so that if there is something going

882
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:05,819
against you or even if there is a fine

883
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:12,210
that has come up in your name then it

884
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:13,740
can be detected many people are not

885
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:16,819
interested in this because they say who

886
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,819
is going to be looking at my information

887
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:22,380
but if you look at Martha Peter I know

888
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:25,430
on the internet you've look up a talk

889
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:30,450
that she given and it's on YouTube

890
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:32,490
they're just nine minutes of talk it's a

891
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:34,259
TED talk but I think it's very

892
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:38,430
interesting and I'm sure you'll find a

893
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:40,740
lot of information in there we're going

894
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:43,440
to do something different now let's hope

895
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:49,140
it works to show you a number of tools

896
00:49:43,440 --> 00:50:04,529
and applications so when we get the

897
00:49:49,140 --> 00:50:06,990
go-ahead we'll go ahead with that we've

898
00:50:04,529 --> 00:50:09,150
needed to put the computer on this

899
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:15,209
little platform in order to be able to

900
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:16,079
do this this is the kind of issue that

901
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,910
will have words they're different

902
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:21,079
screens and adapters and so on

903
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:21,078
we'll get there now

904
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,519
[Music]

905
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:55,210
I can't see anything right now let's see

906
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:57,360
how we can arrange this I'm sorry for

907
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:57,360
this

908
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:05,500
we'll see very different very simple

909
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:08,700
tools and I'm sure you'll be familiar

910
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,700
with many of them

911
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:20,080
basically these are tools that have many

912
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,740
different purposes when we're talking

913
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:28,630
about searching for information there's

914
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:29,859
not just a series of tools but we don't

915
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:33,340
necessarily have to think they'll always

916
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:36,520
be available for us to use some are free

917
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:39,730
and then you have to pay for them some I

918
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,900
used and then they're closed so we have

919
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,910
to them they have to have different

920
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:55,240
tools available in order to be able to

921
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:59,580
work with them one of the objects is

922
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,580
that we might come across her actually

923
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:14,440
and we can gather a variety of

924
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:16,870
information about people get a variety

925
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,710
of information as I was saying such as

926
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:22,990
email addresses telephone numbers

927
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:29,440
aliases their nicknames in social media

928
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:31,629
so we have a very simple tool here just

929
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:36,100
so that you can get an idea of what we

930
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:41,170
can do and in this case it's using email

931
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:42,618
addresses we will attempt to obtain

932
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:49,480
information about a

933
00:52:42,619 --> 00:52:49,480
Janka protection provision sofia sofia

934
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:56,749
so we have our target this is a person

935
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:58,368
we don't know where this person works or

936
00:52:56,749 --> 00:53:02,058
what kind of in email addresses he or

937
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:04,789
she may have but we'd like to do a talk

938
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:06,230
here regarding social engineering there

939
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:09,190
are different types of social

940
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:14,749
engineering there's a physical type

941
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:16,970
whens when somebody goes somewhere and

942
00:53:14,749 --> 00:53:24,410
tries to actually physically get into

943
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:29,990
the facilities for example an operative

944
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:35,118
tries to access a place are the kinds of

945
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:38,680
such as fishing and it's not just

946
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:42,740
malicious emails being sent through a

947
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:46,308
given email account this can be done

948
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:49,069
also through SMS or text messages or

949
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:52,309
even a traditional letter in which we

950
00:53:49,069 --> 00:53:56,680
receive in our home and it's got a logo

951
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:56,680
and everything and it looks very formal

952
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:10,190
and we're told to call a given number or

953
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:12,649
to access an Internet address and pretty

954
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:19,789
much for everything nowadays we use our

955
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:26,119
email we'd hardly use faxes or even

956
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:29,269
regular letters and email is one of the

957
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:33,819
main areas for attack whether it's

958
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:33,819
through fishing for other kinds of tools

959
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:39,680
not working well we're working on it

960
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:45,410
we'll get there in the end you just have

961
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:46,700
said if you're going to be lucky or not

962
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:50,149
if we're going to be able to connect

963
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:51,640
that means everybody I'd like to access

964
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:57,800
a web surfing

965
00:54:51,640 --> 00:55:01,160
in this case it's called hunter this web

966
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:04,340
service is free and we can use it for a

967
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:11,149
series of consultations if we pay for

968
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:16,210
them for example if we would like to get

969
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:16,210
information about a company for example

970
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:27,350
we put in the name of the company intern

971
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:34,040
winter video finish the meal Sophia

972
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:36,350
sized empresa weekly we will receive all

973
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:39,550
the email dresses that have been indexed

974
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,549
for that company

975
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:49,970
1190 email addresses associated to this

976
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:51,799
business and this is a way of getting in

977
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:55,129
contact with people because we have

978
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:57,140
their email address and we have other

979
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:59,450
people maybe working with us and looking

980
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:01,009
for four different people in different

981
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:05,509
departments and we can get to them

982
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:09,020
through those other people only do we

983
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:11,570
have the email addresses here but we

984
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:15,759
also have the pattern that those email

985
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:18,530
addresses use so we have the first name

986
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:22,090
followed by a dot and then the surname

987
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:22,090
at cnn.com

988
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,190
sometimes there are different

989
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:28,010
combinations we have just the first

990
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:30,350
letter with or without a dot and what we

991
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:32,030
need we need that for actually we could

992
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:34,190
actually download all these email

993
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:37,730
addresses and incorporate this into our

994
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:40,240
analysis so what else could we do with

995
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,240
this information

996
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:48,950
after la busca de la pagina energy stays

997
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:52,100
on a page about it or not you could go

998
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:55,339
to Chrome or Firefox and look up Hunton

999
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:58,069
you can incorporate this he do a click

1000
00:56:55,340 --> 00:57:00,530
on the icon and do the same as what I've

1001
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:02,610
done you do a search or wherever you are

1002
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:06,170
from the page where they are you

1003
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:08,730
in the link and it will give you the

1004
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:15,120
email addresses of that page that you're

1005
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:16,680
looking at so we've got the format of

1006
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:30,630
the email addresses in this particular

1007
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:33,060
case what could this be used for I don't

1008
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:39,990
know if you're familiar with these tools

1009
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:42,029
that are developed by a couple of

1010
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:45,450
friends they developed this tool they're

1011
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:49,320
Spaniards and they've developed tools

1012
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:56,700
that are used on a global level such as

1013
00:57:49,320 --> 00:58:03,810
Linux and Kali and so on so related with

1014
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:15,299
OS int so in this particular case let's

1015
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:21,180
have a look at what we could do we could

1016
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:33,360
look up email addresses that we found

1017
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:35,490
previously let's take at gmail.com so

1018
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,260
based on the email addresses that we

1019
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:40,649
generated previously we could put them

1020
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:42,840
into a fire and we could take over the

1021
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:52,560
name of the file into the section and

1022
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:55,590
then do a search we could see if they

1023
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:59,100
see mail address has been recorded on

1024
00:58:55,590 --> 00:59:03,180
any kind of platform online for example

1025
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:04,650
this is one in info jobs it's available

1026
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:07,560
in four jobs and Twitter in this

1027
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:10,790
particular case so we know that a person

1028
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,790
has their Twitter account

1029
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:15,860
so we could try and get a little bit

1030
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:21,830
closer using the information through

1031
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:24,410
info jobs perhaps this person has put a

1032
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:26,690
comment there or a CV there or we could

1033
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:30,700
use a Twitter because we know that that

1034
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,700
person is using that email account

1035
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:50,270
so this reframe work also allows us to

1036
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:53,690
generate patterns generate users in a

1037
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:55,160
random manner you might have a person

1038
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,820
who but you don't know his or her email

1039
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:02,660
address or what their address is so we

1040
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:10,610
could make up random combinations and do

1041
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:15,799
a search on these platforms we could

1042
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:18,500
also use cross-linked and this searches

1043
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:22,190
for information and email addresses on

1044
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:26,660
LinkedIn we'll use the pattern that we

1045
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:31,130
had before for example we would type in

1046
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:32,839
first dot and then blast at cnn.com

1047
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:35,660
in this particular case that's the

1048
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:38,000
pattern we put in the name of the

1049
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:40,839
company and what we're doing is

1050
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:43,970
searching for email addresses in

1051
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:48,260
LinkedIn we could have done this with

1052
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:50,330
hunter before here we have searches

1053
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:53,390
using different search engines such as

1054
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:56,690
Google and so on and we had a number of

1055
01:00:53,390 --> 01:01:02,299
email addresses that we could combine

1056
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:05,650
and link to other platforms with other

1057
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:09,920
kind of scape such as Dimitri or other

1058
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:14,420
recognition escapes we have quite a

1059
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:17,150
number of results here 438 in this

1060
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:22,010
particular case related to this email

1061
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:23,600
address they follow this pattern they

1062
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,660
all follow this pattern the email

1063
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:31,880
addresses

1064
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:42,480
named dr. so we can use this information

1065
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:46,170
and extract something from it so we'll

1066
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:50,610
give a nickname inside this file so

1067
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:53,220
we're going to remove the domain name so

1068
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:55,680
from the start of the page

1069
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:59,870
we'll have this regular expressions

1070
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:05,700
which would be for example a to said

1071
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:11,759
space and dogs and these repeated

1072
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:17,370
characters so look in the names file

1073
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:19,620
that we generated and now we have the

1074
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:27,150
list of all the names what can we do

1075
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:33,020
with this list of names right in aliased

1076
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:33,020
he X T and we store all the nicknames

1077
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,270
now we put in sudo U so u zu Phi

1078
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:48,140
come on okay

1079
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:57,540
now we're going to cross over a file a

1080
01:02:54,360 --> 01:03:03,900
file that we created previously it was L

1081
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:06,660
alias txt and speed tool what it's going

1082
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:08,910
to do is try and see where that alias is

1083
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:12,450
registered on different platforms maybe

1084
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:15,660
in wall apart or any other kind of

1085
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:19,529
social media so you know where that

1086
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:24,450
email is registered it would search in

1087
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:26,930
almost 300 platforms and this would be

1088
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:30,629
the process that we need to go through

1089
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:32,819
well this is one example but we're going

1090
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:35,780
to see how we could combine email

1091
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:45,810
addresses Alice's let's see

1092
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:54,470
another interesting point is a few years

1093
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:54,470
ago 2014 I think it was I created a tool

1094
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:03,480
at the time one of the things it did was

1095
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:05,100
to extract metadata this is an open

1096
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,290
source tool that you can also download

1097
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:11,279
and use and what it does is to gather

1098
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:13,440
information using our Twitter's API so

1099
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:17,180
publicly available information on

1100
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:20,760
Twitter it gathers it massively

1101
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:22,919
processes it and it gives it in a way

1102
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:29,510
that it's easily interpreted by an

1103
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:33,690
analyst so for example when you upload

1104
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:36,300
picture or any sort of image to a social

1105
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:39,120
network social network will clean the

1106
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:51,840
metadata am i happy it didn't used to be

1107
01:04:39,120 --> 01:05:07,830
like this not that long ago if you look

1108
01:04:51,840 --> 01:05:09,990
at this picture this is Steve well he

1109
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:11,850
used to do what Twitter used to do for a

1110
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:14,660
long time was to do the leads metadata

1111
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:17,430
which didn't used to do the beginning

1112
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:22,080
but for example it would leave the

1113
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:25,980
profile picture or metadata that had

1114
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:27,900
already been uploaded pictures would

1115
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:29,460
stay there until someone deleted them

1116
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:32,720
and this is what happened with these

1117
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:36,890
Bosniaks profile picture for example

1118
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:39,600
surprise parties for a 60th anniversary

1119
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:41,430
so this is someone well-known and we

1120
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:44,430
know when they were born but for example

1121
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:46,520
from someone who's not that well-known

1122
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:48,140
it's important

1123
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:50,300
because that could be used as a password

1124
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:54,770
or you know and any other it could be

1125
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:57,980
any other way of recovering a secret so

1126
01:05:54,770 --> 01:06:00,380
here you get the name of the person who

1127
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:02,870
took the pictures someone very well

1128
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:06,320
known in the United States what distance

1129
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:09,380
this picture was taken from so for

1130
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:12,680
example if you need so the better news

1131
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:15,020
that the picture was taken with this

1132
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:17,509
person knowing so it wasn't stolen the

1133
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:19,610
type of camera model all of these

1134
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:22,520
metadata the still social networks

1135
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:28,520
nowadays about where we can find this

1136
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:43,820
information for example if we go on the

1137
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:47,560
Flickr we have here also ceviches this

1138
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:47,560
picture for example this is a building

1139
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:57,230
here at the bottom right you see that

1140
01:06:54,200 --> 01:07:06,230
you can download this picture so we're

1141
01:06:57,230 --> 01:07:09,260
going to copy the URL we're now going to

1142
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:12,580
go on to another site which is going to

1143
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:15,110
tell us and analyze the metadata from

1144
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:19,340
there are many different services lists

1145
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:21,290
to try this well for example we go into

1146
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:23,920
the site and we either upload the

1147
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:26,540
picture which is coffee yet copy the URL

1148
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:29,990
paste the URL that we have just copy it

1149
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:34,840
we and then we can get the metadata for

1150
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:39,830
the picture now you can see that even

1151
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:41,810
pictures ask metadata miniature pictures

1152
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:46,340
that you upload before the actual

1153
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:49,549
picture is uploaded it might be this

1154
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:52,760
miniature picture is not really a

1155
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:56,570
picture it's just a picture within the

1156
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:57,730
picture maybe this miniature picture

1157
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:01,000
sometimes you

1158
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:04,060
make sure you cut it a little bit or you

1159
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,230
change the ISO you cut it you copies of

1160
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:07,210
the Eaton's of the person next to you

1161
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:10,859
cannot be seen but in the miniature

1162
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:15,460
picture if that one has not been

1163
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:17,710
modified then you can still have the

1164
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:20,770
original picture where the other person

1165
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:23,380
is next to us everything what else do we

1166
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:26,830
get we get information about when that

1167
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:29,140
picture was taken the camera I was taken

1168
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:34,509
with it was an icon we can see the model

1169
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:36,100
here the date it was taking we have to

1170
01:08:34,509 --> 01:08:39,149
be very careful with everything we

1171
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:45,930
upload not only pictures but also

1172
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:48,429
documents there and everything else to

1173
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:52,630
go into too much detail about other

1174
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:55,359
tools there are many many tools that you

1175
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:59,350
can use to extract metadata from PDF

1176
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:02,080
Excel documents or files etc that might

1177
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:05,400
be published online about a company and

1178
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:10,330
then may reveal use the names

1179
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:14,608
credentials user names that you can use

1180
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:14,609
to attack and access to service

1181
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:21,880
platforms Microsoft platforms that we

1182
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:26,319
use internal routes almost anything that

1183
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:30,460
could allow attacks against those people

1184
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:31,810
I'm going to leave this here because we

1185
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:33,970
don't have that much time and I'm going

1186
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:35,980
to show you different aspects now

1187
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:41,830
another kind of information that we can

1188
01:09:35,979 --> 01:09:44,259
extract someone might say well if I want

1189
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:46,509
my privacy to be addressed then I just

1190
01:09:44,259 --> 01:09:48,279
want to use the Internet although this

1191
01:09:46,509 --> 01:09:49,660
is really difficult nowadays in there

1192
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:51,790
because whether we want it or no we are

1193
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:52,358
online even if we didn't want to be

1194
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:55,239
online

1195
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:58,750
there are CCTV cameras in the streets

1196
01:09:55,239 --> 01:10:00,910
and security cameras which are filming

1197
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:03,640
us and that can be tapped into or for

1198
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:08,019
example a video from a TV channel and we

1199
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:10,550
have here on television Loney moscow

1200
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:13,489
telegram so whilst

1201
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:16,309
getting this ready I just wanted to say

1202
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:18,468
when it comes to metadata that we always

1203
01:10:16,309 --> 01:10:20,750
have to be very careful which platforms

1204
01:10:18,469 --> 01:10:24,469
were working with because there is a

1205
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:27,440
platform which is supposedly one of the

1206
01:10:24,469 --> 01:10:29,420
most anonymous such as telegram wellness

1207
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:32,178
telegram does not delete metadata so

1208
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:35,480
everything that you upload onto telegram

1209
01:10:32,179 --> 01:10:38,449
whether you unless you have deleted your

1210
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:41,540
metadata yourself you will know that

1211
01:10:38,449 --> 01:10:45,619
that metadata will stay in all the files

1212
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:47,360
you've shed back to I was saying I'm

1213
01:10:45,619 --> 01:10:56,299
going to load a video that we're going

1214
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:59,949
to what try now concept tests who have

1215
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:02,210
generated this is a real video from

1216
01:10:59,949 --> 01:11:12,440
demonstration in Barcelona recent

1217
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:16,040
demonstration in Barcelona the Catalan

1218
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:18,469
process you will not hear anything

1219
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:20,510
because the audio is really it would

1220
01:11:18,469 --> 01:11:24,489
make a real impact we didn't get it

1221
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:29,059
right now but we see lots of people

1222
01:11:24,489 --> 01:11:32,989
these media can be uploaded by users but

1223
01:11:29,059 --> 01:11:35,270
even by police but they can even go on

1224
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:38,440
social networks if users upload that so

1225
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:41,750
we're going to do now because

1226
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:45,348
intelligence allows us and it doesn't

1227
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:48,860
better than us to recognize people

1228
01:11:45,349 --> 01:11:50,710
identify people if someone is a bit

1229
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:53,500
blurred and we cannot see it properly

1230
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:56,869
artificial intelligence will identify

1231
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:58,550
depending on different futures so this

1232
01:11:56,869 --> 01:12:02,299
can be very interesting for different

1233
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:05,020
purposes for example we're going to see

1234
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:10,699
now in real time this is a concept test

1235
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:13,309
we're going to see how with facial

1236
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:15,348
recognition techniques it's going to

1237
01:12:13,309 --> 01:12:19,350
identify the people that are on the

1238
01:12:15,349 --> 01:12:21,030
video in real time we're not getting the

1239
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,920
pictures of everyone because there's

1240
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:26,849
many people but you can see for example

1241
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:31,920
where exactly they are now you can see

1242
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:34,710
there in red where they are some people

1243
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:37,920
are very very hard to see because

1244
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:41,040
they're very very small on the image on

1245
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:46,350
the big image so what could we use this

1246
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:50,280
for both the security forces could use

1247
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:51,750
this information to see who are the

1248
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:57,269
people who are in the first line and are

1249
01:12:51,750 --> 01:13:02,550
actually causing all the issues how

1250
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:03,810
could we automate this for example if we

1251
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,610
know that these people belong to a

1252
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:08,850
specific group if this is a

1253
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:13,019
demonstration from particularly ideology

1254
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:15,540
we could search for profile censorship

1255
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:18,150
networks that are linked to that

1256
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:19,800
ideology we can even check out the

1257
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:22,110
followers they have the friends they

1258
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,730
have we can get all the pictures from

1259
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:25,500
their cross house and do automatically

1260
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:27,950
something is what I'm going to show you

1261
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,950
now

1262
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:51,960
after loaded the profile picture of

1263
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:53,490
Carlos from his Twitter account says I'm

1264
01:13:51,960 --> 01:14:01,590
I think it's Michael Cimino Sommerfeld a

1265
01:13:53,490 --> 01:14:07,410
Twitter locate oh god Oprah no yes so

1266
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:09,260
this is the picture here this is a

1267
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:20,040
picture that Carlos has on his Twitter

1268
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:22,220
profile right now I have downloaded it I

1269
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:28,200
have done is from my Twitter timeline

1270
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:32,400
through to I have downloaded my media

1271
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:34,800
and you can actually download media from

1272
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,080
people it's a specific time so I have

1273
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:41,370
downloaded the multimedia content of my

1274
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:43,200
200 tweets and in one of these there's a

1275
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:46,019
picture of Carlos who I'm asking

1276
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:48,320
the tool to do is to find this picture

1277
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:51,420
of Carlos of an how to unload it

1278
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:54,330
hold on let me let me just check that I

1279
01:14:51,420 --> 01:15:04,860
have downloaded it first because I might

1280
01:14:54,330 --> 01:15:07,250
have deleted it I'm going to do this

1281
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,250
very quickly

1282
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:26,009
and back on Kim Fowley and from my

1283
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:29,010
profile we're going to analyze say the

1284
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:31,890
last hundred tweets and I'm going to ask

1285
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:35,330
it to download and to analyze the

1286
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:39,710
multimedia content from these tweets

1287
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:39,710
that's all we going to do in this case

1288
01:15:53,409 --> 01:16:01,070
and now it is launching research it's

1289
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:03,889
analyzing the last hundred tweets as I

1290
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:08,210
have asked it to do it's downloading the

1291
01:16:03,889 --> 01:16:13,850
multimedia contents now is downloaded

1292
01:16:08,210 --> 01:16:21,949
and now we can execute it from here and

1293
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:44,330
let's see if it identifies the picture

1294
01:16:21,949 --> 01:16:46,699
but I've asked it to identify no

1295
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:50,840
conocida ramen Tamara Filipina kala kala

1296
01:16:46,699 --> 01:17:00,919
telophase C tenemos tiempo en Ramos Roy

1297
01:16:50,840 --> 01:17:04,100
oh ok inform us if you don't know this

1298
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,480
tool and it is worth it to have a look

1299
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,820
at it if we have time' then they will

1300
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:12,468
show it to you yeah I'm just going to do

1301
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:15,110
this demo and but yeah I mean this is a

1302
01:17:12,469 --> 01:17:16,969
really powerful tool because it gives

1303
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:19,370
you even information about the

1304
01:17:16,969 --> 01:17:23,030
timeframes in which that person goes

1305
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:26,929
online which device they use so when you

1306
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:34,159
want to have to undergo targeted attacks

1307
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:38,650
then it is very important let's see

1308
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:38,650
there's been some sort of mistake here

1309
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:48,430
no no call me number two let's just

1310
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:58,690
check where the mistake might be you

1311
01:17:48,430 --> 01:18:02,160
know otherwise I give you think maybe

1312
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:02,160
you have saved it with a different name

1313
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:09,060
otherwise we can just check it from here

1314
01:18:12,119 --> 01:18:17,098
is this a trip this was a machinist calc

1315
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:27,360
arigato

1316
01:18:17,099 --> 01:18:31,260
and therefore sweet para que vemos en la

1317
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:34,139
parte de Carlos this is the report these

1318
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:41,090
are the pictures it has downloaded from

1319
01:18:34,139 --> 01:18:45,480
my last hundred tweets obvious the fear

1320
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:50,010
and you can see one which features

1321
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:53,009
Carlos see as a picture that we took

1322
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:58,889
when we were coming here so what I'm

1323
01:18:53,010 --> 01:19:03,030
going to do now is tell the tool please

1324
01:18:58,889 --> 01:19:06,929
look for catalysis fates his profile

1325
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:08,519
picture based on his profile picture um

1326
01:19:06,929 --> 01:19:15,949
I think I saw sorry yeah I think Jose

1327
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:15,949
see machine is 3 which is where it has

1328
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:27,960
the same pictures I think in this case

1329
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:32,070
we had about 4 5 pictures in one of them

1330
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:35,219
only there was people and finally except

1331
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:37,290
I have identified Carlos in this picture

1332
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:41,010
which is the history that I had shown

1333
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:43,139
you so basically what we trying not to

1334
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:45,860
tell you is how automatically without

1335
01:19:43,139 --> 01:19:48,599
having really to do anything we can

1336
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:50,190
identify people and this can be

1337
01:19:48,599 --> 01:19:51,869
interesting interesting for different

1338
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:54,960
purposes in this case we're talking

1339
01:19:51,869 --> 01:19:59,040
about a demonstration but you could be

1340
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:02,499
trying to identify who this person is

1341
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:04,690
usually with who his friends are who

1342
01:20:02,499 --> 01:20:09,969
his family members are people who have

1343
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:11,499
been tagged sometimes you have a social

1344
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:13,570
networks or even you don't even have

1345
01:20:11,499 --> 01:20:17,530
social networks but you cannot control

1346
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:19,150
that people around you might suck you in

1347
01:20:17,530 --> 01:20:22,989
a picture and even if you're not on that

1348
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:25,449
social network you can be your name can

1349
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:29,039
be published on Twitter so that there is

1350
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:33,759
a way of knowing the people you usually

1351
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:39,789
go with we're going to continue the

1352
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:41,469
presentation now the mother race or

1353
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:49,989
fearless welcomed us

1354
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:51,849
come on visto C sabemos a person on deep

1355
01:20:49,989 --> 01:21:00,638
way trabajar emotions traction de

1356
01:20:51,849 --> 01:21:01,929
correos we've been seeing with tempo

1357
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,539
leaks for example we're never very

1358
01:21:01,929 --> 01:21:06,460
emotional form of you with from you know

1359
01:21:04,539 --> 01:21:07,960
just with the information on me no

1360
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:10,229
address if we know what that person

1361
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:12,940
works for example that we have extracted

1362
01:21:10,229 --> 01:21:15,130
email addresses and we can see which one

1363
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:17,978
might be used with look for that or

1364
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:20,349
searched that even addressing different

1365
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:22,960
social networks so once we have the

1366
01:21:20,349 --> 01:21:25,449
information and we know where we can go

1367
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:28,690
looking for that person comes the next

1368
01:21:25,449 --> 01:21:32,969
stage which is well now let's work with

1369
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:32,969
those social media

1370
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:53,510
keep working blow my social worker races

1371
01:21:51,079 --> 01:21:55,518
until meant to no tenia mucho éxito

1372
01:21:53,510 --> 01:22:00,309
porque but see but if you don't this is

1373
01:21:55,519 --> 01:22:00,309
not it's not my day today for the Bison

1374
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:11,329
this is social meeting this is a v-k

1375
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:14,539
didn't used to be very successful

1376
01:22:11,329 --> 01:22:16,608
because it's used by Eastern countries

1377
01:22:14,539 --> 01:22:21,108
and Russia but now it's getting more

1378
01:22:16,609 --> 01:22:24,010
popular in Spain and other European

1379
01:22:21,109 --> 01:22:26,959
countries it's being increasingly used

1380
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:30,409
we looked for a profile and I thought it

1381
01:22:26,959 --> 01:22:32,688
was interesting because it give us gives

1382
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:37,188
us relevant information Chester's his

1383
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:40,269
date of birth and we if we look at the

1384
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:43,369
entire information regarding this person

1385
01:22:40,269 --> 01:22:46,309
unlike Facebook it does give us personal

1386
01:22:43,369 --> 01:22:49,820
information it gives their political

1387
01:22:46,309 --> 01:22:53,989
ideology their interests the books that

1388
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:57,739
a person might like to read and this

1389
01:22:53,989 --> 01:22:59,299
person is following a right-wing far

1390
01:22:57,739 --> 01:23:05,239
right-wing group and I thought that was

1391
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:07,939
particularly interesting investigation

1392
01:23:05,239 --> 01:23:12,320
you're able to get into these kinds of

1393
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:17,409
groups another of the profiles that I

1394
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:17,409
thought was interesting was Mario seat

1395
01:23:22,179 --> 01:23:37,669
my team profile because they know

1396
01:23:34,429 --> 01:23:39,199
quality we have information on his date

1397
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:48,019
of birth and the last time this person

1398
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:49,999
connected to a device this might be a

1399
01:23:48,019 --> 01:23:51,530
hidden profile because of the

1400
01:23:49,999 --> 01:23:52,349
information that was given but we do

1401
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:54,659
have

1402
01:23:52,349 --> 01:23:59,369
the name of his children and

1403
01:23:54,659 --> 01:24:03,809
grandchildren and here's a Twitter

1404
01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:06,739
account Facebook account beliefs and so

1405
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:14,610
on and even photographs and

1406
01:24:06,739 --> 01:24:17,190
complementary information if we go on to

1407
01:24:14,610 --> 01:24:20,730
the Twitter account for example we can

1408
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:25,009
have a look at something else we get to

1409
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:27,959
this account we have a Google+ account

1410
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:33,659
active and it gives us the confirmation

1411
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:35,310
of the date of birth and this is

1412
01:24:33,659 --> 01:24:37,049
particularly important in terms of

1413
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:38,449
keeping the little bits of information

1414
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:40,800
that we talked about at the beginning

1415
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:44,610
save that information so it can be

1416
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:51,360
analyzed later on in this particular

1417
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:54,809
case it's a Russian social medium we

1418
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:56,429
must not only think that Russian social

1419
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:58,460
media is for Russian people but other

1420
01:24:56,429 --> 01:25:01,139
people might have be on there as well

1421
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:06,179
and this might be vital information for

1422
01:25:01,139 --> 01:25:10,079
our investigation we can gather all this

1423
01:25:06,179 --> 01:25:11,550
information and cross-check it we would

1424
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,489
like to show you other different tools

1425
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:16,380
but we don't have time here but we can

1426
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:20,459
use different sources to make up a

1427
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:22,500
profile download it in file formats that

1428
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:29,699
we were looking at before and then I'll

1429
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:32,190
analyze it afterwards now we have an

1430
01:25:29,699 --> 01:25:38,879
extract here from an account on tin faux

1431
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:41,730
leak it's sent a and my profile and I'd

1432
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,650
like to show you some of the images that

1433
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:46,348
it produces and I thought that was

1434
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:50,549
interesting in terms of analyzing a

1435
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:52,170
profile in this case for a mine it can

1436
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:57,750
be interesting not only the kind of

1437
01:25:52,170 --> 01:26:01,070
tools they're being used but also we can

1438
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:04,639
see the time of day when

1439
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:06,739
a person connects so if I want to attack

1440
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:10,400
a given person or send that person an

1441
01:26:06,739 --> 01:26:12,519
email address or any kind of file then I

1442
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:17,119
need to know when that person might be

1443
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:19,429
connected or might be busier at six

1444
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:23,900
o'clock this person was not connected

1445
01:26:19,429 --> 01:26:25,670
and you can see the time run range so

1446
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:27,469
when the information might be a

1447
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:29,000
particular interest and we can send them

1448
01:26:27,469 --> 01:26:46,730
that drill ephant information and make

1449
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:49,340
the most of that opportunity I want you

1450
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:55,669
to give you an idea of the photographs

1451
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:58,900
we did some many people have - you look

1452
01:26:55,670 --> 01:27:01,610
lies and activated on their devices

1453
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:04,460
sometimes we do that without even

1454
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:06,460
realizing you use Google to go from one

1455
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:11,030
place to another and then you forget to

1456
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:13,280
deactivate it in this particular place

1457
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:15,769
we published a photo when we got to the

1458
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:23,840
train station and indicated the location

1459
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:26,179
of where we were and if we looked on the

1460
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:29,420
fences profile we can see that same

1461
01:27:26,179 --> 01:27:31,670
image so here we get the different

1462
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:40,760
coordinates of these different people

1463
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:43,119
but they can also be falsified maybe

1464
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:46,190
it's something that you're trying to

1465
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:50,659
fool maybe somebody you would believe

1466
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:52,790
that this information is correct and you

1467
01:27:50,659 --> 01:27:56,089
can see where that person is connected

1468
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:58,460
you can put in false information you

1469
01:27:56,090 --> 01:28:06,050
don't necessarily have to trust

1470
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:08,780
everything that is out there we can get

1471
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:11,000
information from different profiles and

1472
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:13,259
we can even get from different platforms

1473
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,520
we can even get a profile

1474
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:18,430
and we have to know whether or not that

1475
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:27,640
information is correct whether it's true

1476
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:30,490
but the bad guys are clever as well and

1477
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:38,280
fake name generator' for example on this

1478
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:41,620
tool we can create a fictitious profile

1479
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:45,210
so if I want to have a Facebook account

1480
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:48,790
and I want to make it look real I can

1481
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:50,800
just set up the name and surname here

1482
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:55,090
with this tool you can set it up in a

1483
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:57,520
random name it gives back numbers that's

1484
01:28:55,090 --> 01:29:01,510
not real they're not operative but they

1485
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:05,080
look real if you want the name to be in

1486
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:07,960
check if you want to select Spain as the

1487
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:11,590
country for example you can determine

1488
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:14,250
the age and based on the information

1489
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:21,190
that we have collected during our

1490
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:22,360
investigation we can decide exactly what

1491
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,980
we want to do I don't really understand

1492
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:28,299
this thing about the percentage of male

1493
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:29,980
and female but anyway we have generated

1494
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:32,530
a name we've said that we want them to

1495
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:36,309
be between 16 and 33 years years of age

1496
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:43,170
to be Spanish and even the geographic

1497
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:48,220
coordinates where they might live find

1498
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:52,270
that photos are the tools that many

1499
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:55,210
people use if we find that somebody is

1500
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:57,370
interacting strangely with us one of the

1501
01:29:55,210 --> 01:30:00,430
most simple things that we can do is to

1502
01:29:57,370 --> 01:30:02,230
do a search using a profile picture to

1503
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:04,330
see if somebody's actually really using

1504
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:07,120
it on another account or if it's a

1505
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:10,960
picture of a famous person and linked to

1506
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:15,690
a false account then we have services

1507
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:19,960
such as this which is person assist and

1508
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:21,579
this sets up random faces they're not

1509
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:26,619
actually real faces it

1510
01:30:21,579 --> 01:30:28,329
science fiction this these faces don't

1511
01:30:26,619 --> 01:30:31,049
actually exist these people don't

1512
01:30:28,329 --> 01:30:31,049
actually exist

1513
01:30:32,849 --> 01:30:38,829
I can choose and have a look through

1514
01:30:36,939 --> 01:30:41,889
scroll through until I find the one that

1515
01:30:38,829 --> 01:30:46,419
I'm interested in and they look almost

1516
01:30:41,889 --> 01:30:49,979
real we can't do this with an inverse

1517
01:30:46,419 --> 01:30:52,809
search it will make us very difficult

1518
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:54,219
and it makes it very difficult to know

1519
01:30:52,809 --> 01:30:56,769
if the person that we're interacting

1520
01:30:54,219 --> 01:31:02,649
with is actually real or somebody using

1521
01:30:56,769 --> 01:31:06,030
these kinds of tools we commented to

1522
01:31:02,649 --> 01:31:10,800
your localization and we can actually

1523
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:10,800
falsify that information if we want to

1524
01:31:16,409 --> 01:31:23,619
we might need to use a beacon letter

1525
01:31:19,359 --> 01:31:28,599
given any given time and we can use that

1526
01:31:23,619 --> 01:31:33,030
once I've created a digital beacon I can

1527
01:31:28,599 --> 01:31:41,289
use it to create an interesting URL and

1528
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:44,619
my objective might be interested in so

1529
01:31:41,289 --> 01:31:47,409
I'm going to a Black Friday offer and

1530
01:31:44,619 --> 01:31:49,329
I'm going to select these shoes I'm

1531
01:31:47,409 --> 01:32:00,308
interested in that so I copy down the

1532
01:31:49,329 --> 01:32:02,759
URL then I go across here any other well

1533
01:32:00,309 --> 01:32:02,760
not got another

1534
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:15,990
so we have the image that we were

1535
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:26,650
looking at with the special offer and

1536
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:31,210
this is created a short URL and it's

1537
01:32:26,650 --> 01:33:35,170
this one that we can see here now what a

1538
01:32:31,210 --> 01:33:38,050
CEO but know that so what we can do this

1539
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:47,710
is to get a shortener and we're cutting

1540
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:53,290
down this link you know cocido see

1541
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:59,950
you're ready so resulta que aqui y la

1542
01:33:53,290 --> 01:34:03,640
corte so we end up with a link that

1543
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:08,139
takes us to the original page but what

1544
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:10,800
has happened here I take a look down

1545
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:13,860
here the shortener

1546
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:20,460
cut the domain name to make it shorter

1547
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:26,160
but it's linked to this webpage so here

1548
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:37,290
IP logger sounds a bit suspicious so if

1549
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:43,530
I go to a shortening service and I go

1550
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:46,680
back again and I connect again and I

1551
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:51,139
give this a shortened URL to my

1552
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:55,290
objective takes the person to the

1553
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:58,370
original webpage so that the person

1554
01:34:55,290 --> 01:34:58,370
doesn't suspect anything

1555
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:06,930
endings were second second now we will

1556
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:13,550
see the IPS to which the person has

1557
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:18,060
actually connected so when we get

1558
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:23,250
shortened links or news even when it's

1559
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:26,100
from somebody that we know well it's a

1560
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:34,020
good idea to take a look at the length

1561
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:42,750
and because there are services that

1562
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:44,910
allow us to lengthen those URLs if

1563
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:48,450
somebody wanted to send us this URL

1564
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:53,670
through Twitter for example what Twitter

1565
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:59,490
wouldn't tell us is be careful going

1566
01:35:53,670 --> 01:36:02,550
into a malicious page but what you have

1567
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:05,190
is actually a blacklist you can create

1568
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:09,990
your own shortener and so Twitter would

1569
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:13,799
not detect that and some of them don't

1570
01:36:09,990 --> 01:36:15,780
even actually have that blacklist if

1571
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:22,160
it's sent by what's up for example there

1572
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:22,160
is no alert here we have a grub afire

1573
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:31,050
and currently this gives us a lot of

1574
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:36,030
information it even gives us the

1575
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:43,890
resolution of a screen and the amount of

1576
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:54,120
battery that his slide here you're given

1577
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:57,120
an alert you comment it just by clicking

1578
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:58,380
play in order to be redirected how many

1579
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,840
pages tell you that you are being

1580
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:05,280
redirected what many of them so you just

1581
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:06,870
click on OK and then you go to your

1582
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:11,280
arrive at the page you can't see that

1583
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:16,769
there's anything strange there in actual

1584
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:25,170
fact the basic information about you has

1585
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:27,300
been left there in the trail if they

1586
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:28,860
know the version and the operating

1587
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:34,230
system that were using somebody can

1588
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:36,450
attack is using this information more

1589
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:39,570
and more we come across links and even

1590
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:43,230
companies use these shorteners that we

1591
01:37:39,570 --> 01:37:48,690
were talking about indeed there's been a

1592
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:51,089
recent campaign by the ministry and they

1593
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:52,559
created a shortener and when people

1594
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:57,180
receive this they thought it was

1595
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:59,340
something of this kind so what we've

1596
01:37:57,180 --> 01:38:01,710
seen so far is that we've been gathering

1597
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:03,990
a lot of different information we've got

1598
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:07,500
email addresses all types of different

1599
01:38:03,990 --> 01:38:10,710
information organizations nicknames and

1600
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:13,800
so on and there are specific tools in

1601
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:18,420
order to analyze this information some

1602
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:20,940
are free some you have to pay for but if

1603
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:25,920
the information we want to analyze is

1604
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:29,910
not too great in quantity then we can go

1605
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:35,780
to this page which is called oh oh no oh

1606
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:37,970
no oh no don't and

1607
01:38:35,780 --> 01:38:40,420
we can put all the information in in

1608
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:45,800
there weekend

1609
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:53,150
gather it there in a visual manner where

1610
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:55,220
a partir de una persona in Oh Noble we

1611
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:59,480
can look at companies that are listed on

1612
01:38:55,220 --> 01:39:04,730
ibex 35 and on the different business

1613
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:11,440
registries just using the name of a

1614
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:21,589
person or a company we can see the

1615
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:23,360
relationship might have a person and you

1616
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:27,170
might wanted to take that they're in in

1617
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:29,480
Desa and they're also in Caixa bank so

1618
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:35,990
depending on the kind of objective we

1619
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:46,250
have these kinds of tools can be very

1620
01:39:35,990 --> 01:39:49,190
useful for our analysis we find is that

1621
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:51,230
the cyber criminal has gathered on the

1622
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:54,200
information they wanted from social

1623
01:39:51,230 --> 01:39:57,349
media from LinkedIn any sort of platform

1624
01:39:54,200 --> 01:40:00,470
that we can think of we have named the

1625
01:39:57,350 --> 01:40:03,620
main social media but we can find this

1626
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:06,290
person has an accountant Twitter we can

1627
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:08,690
actually get their telephone number

1628
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:12,440
extract their profile information all

1629
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:14,750
their identity platforms so depending on

1630
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:17,150
the information the cyber criminal has

1631
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:19,550
gathered and the objective that they had

1632
01:40:17,150 --> 01:40:22,309
at the beginning we have mentioned

1633
01:40:19,550 --> 01:40:24,140
before and in this case the cyber

1634
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:26,180
criminal in order to get an

1635
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:28,820
approximation and depending on the

1636
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:30,860
information they have gathered

1637
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:33,199
my decide whether they need to use an

1638
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:36,259
avatar which is a girl or a boy

1639
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:37,909
with different features Oh according to

1640
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:40,219
the information they have cupboard or

1641
01:40:37,909 --> 01:40:41,809
they might not even need anyone who is

1642
01:40:40,219 --> 01:40:45,409
extremely good-looking because that

1643
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:47,540
their target might be all the planning

1644
01:40:45,409 --> 01:40:52,159
to launch an indirect attack so they do

1645
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:53,929
need to find anything too elaborate

1646
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:55,460
so it's sometimes in order to choose

1647
01:40:53,929 --> 01:40:57,619
quickly approach an objective is

1648
01:40:55,460 --> 01:41:00,170
creating an issue for that objective and

1649
01:40:57,619 --> 01:41:03,559
then solving it for them for example on

1650
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:11,150
Twitter you I create a series of avatars

1651
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:14,150
and I can and I start systems just by

1652
01:41:11,150 --> 01:41:19,129
insulting or attacking the objective or

1653
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:24,230
criticizing anyone what my aim is so why

1654
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:27,440
I'm going to do I'm going criticize that

1655
01:41:24,230 --> 01:41:32,949
person through my avatar start making

1656
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:38,928
them feel defenseless and that's why I

1657
01:41:32,949 --> 01:41:41,059
come in interacting and destroying those

1658
01:41:38,929 --> 01:41:43,489
people who were criticizing in the first

1659
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:46,210
place so from there that person

1660
01:41:43,489 --> 01:41:49,250
unconsciously you will be thankful to me

1661
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:51,349
so when on in social media you find that

1662
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:52,940
someone is criticizing you and then all

1663
01:41:51,349 --> 01:41:55,550
of a sudden someone you need to know

1664
01:41:52,940 --> 01:42:01,009
it's not into helping you just out of

1665
01:41:55,550 --> 01:42:02,780
the blue then be suspicious and then we

1666
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:05,989
have the second approach which is an

1667
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:07,880
indirect use limit approach we have

1668
01:42:05,989 --> 01:42:09,769
analysed the information we have seen

1669
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:13,540
that our objective one is married to

1670
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:16,699
Lydia and has a daughter

1671
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:18,829
maybe I'm helpful to choose maybe I

1672
01:42:16,699 --> 01:42:20,509
don't want to have a direct approach

1673
01:42:18,829 --> 01:42:23,630
because I don't want to get suspicious

1674
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:26,090
actors create different avatars and I

1675
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:28,369
approach every single one of the people

1676
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:32,449
I want to get close to and in this case

1677
01:42:28,369 --> 01:42:34,130
for example I get Lydia or course it and

1678
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:36,049
I approach them little by little because

1679
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:38,369
one of the first things you should do is

1680
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:40,829
that when someone you didn't know

1681
01:42:38,369 --> 01:42:43,348
asks to be your friends and say friend

1682
01:42:40,829 --> 01:42:45,148
requests you have to wonder why do they

1683
01:42:43,349 --> 01:42:47,070
want to be my friends maybe we don't

1684
01:42:45,149 --> 01:42:49,110
even have friends in common or we might

1685
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:51,419
even have friends in common but in that

1686
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:53,909
case we have to ask that person wouldn't

1687
01:42:51,419 --> 01:43:00,829
they really know the third person base

1688
01:42:53,909 --> 01:43:03,449
sending us a friend request and we

1689
01:43:00,829 --> 01:43:06,148
running out of time I have already

1690
01:43:03,449 --> 01:43:07,259
mentioned this example but that is what

1691
01:43:06,149 --> 01:43:11,129
I was mentioning earlier about

1692
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:15,959
geolocalization how we can so easily get

1693
01:43:11,129 --> 01:43:18,929
a user's IP is true we have to know that

1694
01:43:15,959 --> 01:43:21,148
they might use VPNs or any sort of proxy

1695
01:43:18,929 --> 01:43:23,280
but depending on our aim or our

1696
01:43:21,149 --> 01:43:24,989
objective we will be able to know

1697
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:27,119
straight away whether it is enough to

1698
01:43:24,989 --> 01:43:28,320
use these tools or not depending on the

1699
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:33,959
result we get

1700
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:37,018
and well we've with said yeah I wanted

1701
01:43:33,959 --> 01:43:38,699
to mention here or node or the platform

1702
01:43:37,019 --> 01:43:41,249
app just shown you which can be very

1703
01:43:38,699 --> 01:43:44,129
interesting if we want to have a graphic

1704
01:43:41,249 --> 01:43:47,789
representation of our results in order

1705
01:43:44,129 --> 01:43:50,939
to have quality information and to show

1706
01:43:47,789 --> 01:43:55,530
this information also once we here which

1707
01:43:50,939 --> 01:43:58,379
is wanted to show you we have 10 best

1708
01:43:55,530 --> 01:44:01,590
practices that we have listed here and

1709
01:43:58,379 --> 01:44:05,249
these can help us to detect criminal

1710
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:07,739
activity to help us protect from that

1711
01:44:05,249 --> 01:44:10,999
for example ego surfing just look

1712
01:44:07,739 --> 01:44:14,489
yourselves up on the internet it's not

1713
01:44:10,999 --> 01:44:16,889
because you want to see what people say

1714
01:44:14,489 --> 01:44:18,598
about you it's because it's important to

1715
01:44:16,889 --> 01:44:20,519
use it and use different combinations

1716
01:44:18,599 --> 01:44:24,239
it's very important to know for example

1717
01:44:20,519 --> 01:44:25,979
responsible use of corporate accounts we

1718
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:28,110
haven't mentioned this but through all

1719
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:30,719
the information that we have gathered on

1720
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:33,148
LinkedIn and different social media you

1721
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:34,949
just go to different platforms where

1722
01:44:33,149 --> 01:44:37,679
these links are and you can get

1723
01:44:34,949 --> 01:44:40,289
information what happens many people

1724
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,510
just signup to different networks such

1725
01:44:40,289 --> 01:44:45,360
as Purdue for example with their company

1726
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:47,349
account and I'm not going to get a new

1727
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:49,629
email address because then

1728
01:44:47,349 --> 01:44:52,719
I have to do more work and that's what

1729
01:44:49,629 --> 01:44:54,579
can bring issues so everything we're not

1730
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:59,019
going to be able to defend ourselves

1731
01:44:54,579 --> 01:45:01,419
from let's just not make available not

1732
01:44:59,019 --> 01:45:03,789
just because cyber criminals can reuse

1733
01:45:01,419 --> 01:45:05,439
the information from our account

1734
01:45:03,789 --> 01:45:07,570
information all the information that

1735
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:09,340
we're making publicly available but

1736
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:12,308
because in the future and this has

1737
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:14,619
happened to public figures that they

1738
01:45:12,309 --> 01:45:17,079
have been embarrassed about information

1739
01:45:14,619 --> 01:45:18,969
that they've published years ago then

1740
01:45:17,079 --> 01:45:21,329
you use a double authentic

1741
01:45:18,969 --> 01:45:27,939
authentification factors so the people

1742
01:45:21,329 --> 01:45:31,199
can you know use our information you can

1743
01:45:27,939 --> 01:45:33,669
also get alerts if someone is using your

1744
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:35,369
information so that you can go a step

1745
01:45:33,669 --> 01:45:38,369
ahead of them and change your password

1746
01:45:35,369 --> 01:45:41,589
and of course do not reuse passwords

1747
01:45:38,369 --> 01:45:43,509
because if someone finds out your

1748
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:45,699
password because they've gathered it

1749
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:47,979
from LinkedIn or Badou or any other

1750
01:45:45,699 --> 01:45:52,388
service if you're using that password

1751
01:45:47,979 --> 01:45:54,939
for your company account or for anything

1752
01:45:52,389 --> 01:45:56,159
else then they are going to have access

1753
01:45:54,939 --> 01:45:59,769
to that as well

1754
01:45:56,159 --> 01:46:02,018
metadata as well there are applications

1755
01:45:59,769 --> 01:46:04,899
even for mobile phones that allow us to

1756
01:46:02,019 --> 01:46:06,159
delete metadata from everything that we

1757
01:46:04,899 --> 01:46:07,959
were closing so we didn't share

1758
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:11,709
information then we don't want to share

1759
01:46:07,959 --> 01:46:14,409
really and applied configuration as well

1760
01:46:11,709 --> 01:46:17,050
when you install applications make sure

1761
01:46:14,409 --> 01:46:18,789
that they cannot connect to your

1762
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:21,129
application so that people can not add

1763
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:26,259
to you that you didn't know them for

1764
01:46:21,129 --> 01:46:28,599
example disable geolocalization you

1765
01:46:26,260 --> 01:46:30,489
might want to have a private profile

1766
01:46:28,599 --> 01:46:32,889
rather than a public profile just have a

1767
01:46:30,489 --> 01:46:34,749
look at the privacy options that that

1768
01:46:32,889 --> 01:46:36,699
platform gives you for example that no

1769
01:46:34,749 --> 01:46:38,978
one can look for you through your email

1770
01:46:36,699 --> 01:46:40,808
address because in some platforms people

1771
01:46:38,979 --> 01:46:42,999
can do it so if I just find one of your

1772
01:46:40,809 --> 01:46:45,939
email addresses might be a leak I don't

1773
01:46:42,999 --> 01:46:48,070
know who this is from but through social

1774
01:46:45,939 --> 01:46:52,659
media I might be able to identify who

1775
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:54,429
the person is that uses this email and

1776
01:46:52,659 --> 01:46:58,449
there I also can

1777
01:46:54,429 --> 01:47:00,280
where there are leaks and they say we've

1778
01:46:58,449 --> 01:47:03,519
been filming you when you were watching

1779
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:05,110
pornography or doing anything more

1780
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:08,290
private they give you your password and

1781
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:11,290
your username they can even get your

1782
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:15,190
social media from that email address so

1783
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:16,659
make sure that you do have your security

1784
01:47:15,190 --> 01:47:19,000
configuration you previously

1785
01:47:16,659 --> 01:47:21,460
configuration always double-check when

1786
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:24,250
someone sends a friend's request just

1787
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:26,110
double check and make sure whether you

1788
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:29,320
should let this person get into your

1789
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:31,179
circle and above all as we were saying

1790
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:33,940
at the beginning we were talking about

1791
01:47:31,179 --> 01:47:38,199
social engineering when someone sends

1792
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:41,110
you an unusual request just don't trust

1793
01:47:38,199 --> 01:47:43,178
them regardless of where this comes from

1794
01:47:41,110 --> 01:47:45,130
even if it's supposed to be my boss if

1795
01:47:43,179 --> 01:47:46,469
my boss is asking me for something that

1796
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:50,260
they've never done like such as

1797
01:47:46,469 --> 01:47:52,600
transferring four million euros just

1798
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:55,840
don't do it because we're seeing more

1799
01:47:52,600 --> 01:48:00,040
and more that tools get more difficult

1800
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:03,880
to be identified they can change videos

1801
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:05,290
or they can get a picture from a video

1802
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:10,510
like one of these pictures that we've

1803
01:48:05,290 --> 01:48:13,409
created and then make a video with that

1804
01:48:10,510 --> 01:48:17,070
picture making that person try to

1805
01:48:13,409 --> 01:48:21,519
interact with me and we've even seen

1806
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:24,190
cases where someone starts a

1807
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:26,650
conversation with you even on skype in

1808
01:48:24,190 --> 01:48:28,599
real time you are talking to this person

1809
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:31,599
are you sure that I need to transfer

1810
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:32,949
this money this might be the CEO or you

1811
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,630
you've lost one of the managing

1812
01:48:32,949 --> 01:48:36,190
directors you you realize that this is

1813
01:48:34,630 --> 01:48:38,949
the person you identify them this is in

1814
01:48:36,190 --> 01:48:44,320
real-time there's no one behind that

1815
01:48:38,949 --> 01:48:49,690
person basically what they're doing is

1816
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:51,909
taking a person and using the picture of

1817
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:54,070
the other person to simulate that it is

1818
01:48:51,909 --> 01:48:57,250
that person who's talking to you or for

1819
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:59,860
example when you get emails asking you

1820
01:48:57,250 --> 01:49:02,170
to make a transfer or to change the bank

1821
01:48:59,860 --> 01:49:03,309
transfer is said they have infiltrated

1822
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:05,140
the

1823
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:07,870
company's communications and through

1824
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:10,600
artificial intelligence they take the

1825
01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:12,400
writing pattern of that person and their

1826
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:14,410
replicators so that it's as similar as

1827
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:17,349
possible and it's hence more difficult

1828
01:49:14,410 --> 01:49:19,330
to see there it's a scam well we're

1829
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:20,920
really sorry about the little technical

1830
01:49:19,330 --> 01:49:22,360
inconvenience but thank you so so much

1831
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:25,750

1832
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:26,410
questions we'll be happy to answer to

1833
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:30,490
you sometime

1834
01:49:26,410 --> 01:49:34,650
if we can help just let us know Rocky

1835
01:49:30,490 --> 01:49:34,650
