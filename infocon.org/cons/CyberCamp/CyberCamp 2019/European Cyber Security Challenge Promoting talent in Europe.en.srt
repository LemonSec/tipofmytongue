2
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:14,969
video for the EEC cybersecurity

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,920
challenge I'm going not to I'm going to

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,529
try not to take too much time service to

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,119
my colleagues talk as well just want to

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,359
explain what the program is about how it

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,509
works and how it has evolved ever since

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,390
Anisa took over the project already four

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,270
years ago and what the future looks like

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:41,760
for this project or with planned and its

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:46,860
development so as you know nowadays we

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,390
do need cybersecurity experts there is a

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,120
great need

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,059
cyber experts not only in technical

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,800
areas but also in legal compliance and

16
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:02,519
many other fields this is a very

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,470
transversal area in every company so not

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,090
only I'm looking for technical knowledge

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:12,110
but also for knowledge of other fields

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:14,549
and also have different skills such as

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,640
public speaking being able to

22
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,930
communicate to manage and to presented

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,820
projects so things which are no

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,710
necessarily technical so other than

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,229
promoting technical knowledge we are

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,079
also trying to promote other types of

27
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:37,799
skills so saying public speaking

28
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:44,130
teamwork and so on just to give you some

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:47,399
context the ECSC came under the umbrella

30
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,408
of cybersecurity strategy in 2013 and we

31
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,960
got a mandate from the Commission to

32
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,979
organize a competition at a European

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,329
level for all countries at the time the

34
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,259
world really seven countries which were

35
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:04,798
partaking in national level competitions

36
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,750
and aneesa's idea was to give support to

37
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,860
those countries all right so the

38
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,860
competition could grow

39
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:16,710
aims of this challenge to promote CTF

40
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,950
national competitions in the same way

41
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,820
that we're doing it here in Spain

42
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:27,030
evidently organises their own national

43
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:29,250
competitions and from that they select

44
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,520
the people who will compete at European

45
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,830
level and what we're trying to do with

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,740
this is to get more and more nations

47
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,620
from the European Union to have training

48
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,900
programs food cams and participate in

49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,660
this challenge and at the end as AV aim

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,370
is to manage to train cyber experts in

51
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,920
cybersecurity experts in every country

52
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,760
we think it's a very interesting project

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,160
to promote cybersecurity it's very

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,519
exciting it involves young people it

55
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,460
also entails some competition and at the

56
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,900
end of the day it puts the spotlight on

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,390
cybersecurity and it can help future

58
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,730
talents to actually work in

59
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,190
cybersecurity so we want to identify and

60
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,530
promote talent we want to develop

61
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,510
contact networks so at the cybersecurity

62
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,300
world is quite small compared to other

63
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:25,230
areas and fields and everyone knows each

64
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:30,450
other and so whoever takes part in the

65
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:34,109
ECSC my actually even come together in

66
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:42,420
the end and gets up together or be the

67
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:44,730
future leaders of cybersecurity target

68
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,299
audience is obviously student both high

69
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,280
school and university students

70
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:54,600
industries so that they can find future

71
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,670
workers for them and the public so then

72
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:03,150
through security they can see their

73
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:06,739
these activities are taking place any

74
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,720
contribute to this project basically

75
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:13,050
three parts I'm just saying that Anisa

76
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,330
does not organize the ec-series like the

77
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,310
Olympic Committee for the Olympics so we

78
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,350
try to give support to you the country

79
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,320
it's being organ

80
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,940
in this year it was in Romania but he

81
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,810
was England next year's going to take

82
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,760
things in Austria and so why Anissa

83
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,220
tries to do is to promote and to find

84
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,640
some continuity in the project starting

85
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,700
with a strategic support we can actually

86
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,250
provide because we can have a role to

87
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,710
bring transparency and equity which

88
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,710
other organizations might not have we

89
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:48,140
also support development and governance

90
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,859
framework and finally we give technical

91
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:57,200
support

92
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:58,960
I think strategic support that Anissa

93
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,960
gives to the project has been very

94
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:07,370
relevant indeed will see a graph later

95
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:10,250
on how the project has grown joined but

96
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:14,680
basically aneesa's content works in

97
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,680
every country through different bodies

98
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:24,260
as many other groups so through them we

99
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,030
try to get countries to join the

100
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,880
initiative and we try to help them with

101
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,830
any issue that may arise on and say why

102
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,630
are you know taking part can we help you

103
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,250
so that you can actually eventually take

104
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,900
that or would you like to take part as

105
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,280
an observer so that you can enter the

106
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:43,969
cycle and start seeing how we work so

107
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:50,659
this approach has been quite successful

108
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:52,550
as next year we have at least three new

109
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,000
countries which have already taken

110
00:05:52,550 --> 00:06:01,090
places of service and just about to

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,860
start a compact activity another one of

112
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,799
legs with which leaders trying to

113
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:12,260
support is governance framework through

114
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:15,440
a steering committee and trying to do we

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,120
create the government structure which is

116
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,650
the steering committee and this

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,780
committee is the one that is going to

118
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,700
design how the project evolves and from

119
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,890
Anisa what we try is to give it cannot

120
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,960
annuity to have a baseline for the

121
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,229
project those decision-making is always

122
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,010
transparent but it is fair

123
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,830
there are two meetings every year we try

124
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,270
to support the steering committee or the

125
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,890
Syrian committee is trying to support

126
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,450
the National Organization we foster

127
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:47,330
collaboration between different nations

128
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,490
because cybersecurity for example in

129
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,260
Spain is very advanced but there are

130
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,660
other countries which didn't even have a

131
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,870
training structure or challenge

132
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,910
structure or cybersecurity so that

133
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,900
knowledge that we have in Spain in other

134
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:04,670
countries such as Germany or England

135
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,190
they have very strong structures there's

136
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:11,120
a very strong foundations they can help

137
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,710
the countries which and also advanced in

138
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,180
this sense and that is one of the things

139
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,590
that the steering committee is trying to

140
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:23,000
promote when it comes to technical

141
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:28,190
support we try to do is to help the

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,870
organising country challenges we have a

143
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,250
school board which receives for the

144
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,530
first honest yeah and it has been

145
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,350
improved dramatically this year with all

146
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,479
the ideas that we gathered through

147
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,920
Soviet service you feedback but also

148
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,910
with the eighties from the steering

149
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:47,090
committee we also try to promote

150
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:49,520
information exchange tours and we are

151
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:54,020
going to have a new one will be launched

152
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,570
soon guidelines and guides for experts

153
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,400
and for people who need it we promote

154
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,860
the winning team so that they go to

155
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,549
Brussels and present in front of the

156
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,730
Commission similar and we also try to

157
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,880
have coordinating policies our public

158
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:13,970
affairs team are always there during the

159
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,980
event they try to program and schedule

160
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:20,150
meetings to share pictures to share

161
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:22,580
videos to have everyone aligned and send

162
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,219
the same message during the challenge

163
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,310
and now I'm going to show you another

164
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,660
video this is a surprise for the a goal

165
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:34,400
and I saw can we have the second video

166
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:37,040
please it's very short it is what the

167
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,919
challenge looks like the team knows

168
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,689
already because they've been there this

169
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,110
is something that was recorded with a

170
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,110
drone

171
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,430
and for all those young people who might

172
00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,449
be in the room

173
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:04,729
I hope this draws your attention and the

174
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,730
you will be with us in one and two years

175
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,770
right to the event in Bucharest took

176
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:14,330
place in the second biggest building in

177
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:17,579
the world the Parliament building

178
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,650
Belgian Belgium didn't take part in the

179
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,200
incident we had three new countries and

180
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,930
two observers motor and Finland we had

181
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,920
over 200 participants and sponsors and

182
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:32,370
team leaders finally the winner was

183
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,349
Romania and Italy runners-up and finally

184
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,300
all children which who are going to be

185
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,520
the organizers here you can see their

186
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,729
impact on social network there isn't a

187
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,780
big difference compared to the previous

188
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,340
year but there are less negative

189
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:50,280
feedback which is already something good

190
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:53,100
and this is how the project has evolved

191
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,220
as was mentioning before since - 2016

192
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,840
when Anissa started getting involved in

193
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,630
the project business increased

194
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,670
exponentially and we're hoping as I said

195
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:07,680
that two three needs teams join next

196
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:10,589
year and also we need to find financing

197
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,660
for the participating teams so that they

198
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,850
keep on coming because sometimes

199
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:19,920
depending on the sponsors teams make it

200
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:22,650
or not so we're trying to create some

201
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,170
sort of financing to obey so that

202
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,510
countries can actually have access to it

203
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:30,839
and have at least some sort of basic

204
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,610
trainings and boot camps for teams to

205
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:38,550
train and then take part in the

206
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:41,280
challenge so we have already agreed on

207
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,219
the next few challenges this is a really

208
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,380
good presentation business start because

209
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,850
when we are trying to find sponsors and

210
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,490
year and we tell someone that you

211
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,950
already have five events scheduled no

212
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,190
one can say that this is going to be a

213
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,190
one-off

214
00:10:55,390 --> 00:11:00,670
so from Anissa we're trying to have an

215
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,910
international competition which means

216
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:07,780
outside of Europe obviously the

217
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,990
continental intercontinental competition

218
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,780
we have already started making contact

219
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:17,770
with people from early aid thanks to

220
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,900
Spain we've got contacts with Japan with

221
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,960
Australia and we're going to try and

222
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:25,270
have an intercontinental competition for

223
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,340
following the years actually we hope

224
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:34,030
this will take place in Greece which is

225
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:37,720
where Anisa headquarters at and finally

226
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:42,100
next year the challenge will take place

227
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:47,670
in real Vienna between 3rd and 7th

228
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,670
November and we hope to see some of you

229
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:58,780
and what does the future hold the future

230
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,990
of Annisa with the challenge is to keep

231
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:05,980
supporting new countries to take part

232
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:08,290
the challenge try to help logistically

233
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,410
the organising country and everything

234
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:15,240
they need be it's quarter it's being

235
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:18,069
happier challenges be it having speakers

236
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,650
unlined with other activities from the

237
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,420
Commission's such as woman for cyber

238
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,959
which is a program that is going to be

239
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:28,839
launched very soon from any service to

240
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,390
get women involved in cyber security in

241
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:34,920
general and we hope that the challenge

242
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:40,720
will be an interesting program to foster

243
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:42,610
women joining cyber security cyber

244
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,310
security mob as well and cybersecurity

245
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,210
strategy national cybersecurity strategy

246
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:52,119
as well and as I was saying before

247
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:54,880
creating European team Team Europe that

248
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,650
can partake in competitions and

249
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,240
intercontinental competitions as we were

250
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:05,650
saying thank you very much I hope this

251
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:08,830
gives you a clearer idea now of what's

252
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:11,500
going on other than what's been done

253
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,990
here in Spain and I think this is very

254
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,820
motivating both from a European and

255
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:23,320
national point of view even further than

256
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:25,810
that thank you very much Thank You

introduction it's a pleasure to be here

271
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:16,210
once again to be here talking about the

272
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:18,370
ECSC we're in the final phase of the

273
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:24,130
Year CyberLink fix we've just had that

274
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:27,100
and I'm going to talk about a move over

275
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:29,680
to the positive side yeah we've got the

276
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,020
presentation up now I'd like to talk

277
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,880
about four things the role of Antibes

278
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:42,090
and the competition it's a decisive role

279
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:46,180
in different areas the journey that

280
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:47,320
we've had of the last five years for

281
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:52,510
ECSC

282
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:55,570
and the recent competition in October

283
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:59,890
and probably the most interesting part

284
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:02,710
is how to participate in in this and be

285
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,569
part of the selected team I've been

286
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,600
working hard on this since

287
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:12,320
Monday people have been asking me when

288
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,820
the selection will begin and what the

289
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,350
requirements are and I don't want it to

290
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,550
be have any doubts about that

291
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:23,780
I hope it's interesting for you and

292
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:26,180
Alejandro and Adrian are the present

293
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,400
part of the selection that but you are

294
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,469
the future because the fact that you're

295
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,500
in cyber camp that you've been in the

296
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,820
cyber Olympics or in the final of the

297
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,220
competition tomorrow

298
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:39,110
means that you're in a good position to

299
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,120
be part of that pre selection of

300
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,150
candidates to be part of the national

301
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,210
team and the next next year they will

302
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:52,040
participate in Vienna in Austria in the

303
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:55,160
European challenge for cyber security so

304
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:04,280
I will begin by explaining a sea-based

305
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:06,260
role its role is to create the national

306
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,589
team the people in the European

307
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,600
competition that is so how did that they

308
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,780
do it through national competitions and

309
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,530
once the team has been selected then in

310
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:21,770
theory has to train the team we'll talk

311
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:25,400
about this a little bit later on and the

312
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:27,880
purpose is to prepare the team the

313
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:33,380
national team for the competition we

314
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:35,150
also accompany the national team as

315
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,510
tatiana was saying we've been in it for

316
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:41,150
a few years and last year was in london

317
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,680
this year in bucharest and it's a very

318
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,660
positive experience we'll talk a bit

319
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,790
more about this later on we're also

320
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,610
members of the steering committee there

321
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,849
in committee and I'll talk about that in

322
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,810
a bit and in 2017 we had a dual

323
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,690
challenge

324
00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:00,170
it was participating in the competition

325
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,060
and organizing it organizing the

326
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,740
European cyber suit key challenge in

327
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:09,649
Malaga so what's the steering committee

328
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:12,710
it's not a very visible work

329
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,470
it's back-office work but it's a group

330
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,939
that

331
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,400
made up of all the countries

332
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:20,919
participating in the competition but we

333
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,230
do have every decisive role it's a great

334
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,750
commitment because we are very aligned

335
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,539
with the objectives of the competition

336
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,850
we have been working over the last few

337
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:34,679
years in on a number of initiatives

338
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:38,049
events and support programs to identify

339
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,960
talented cybersecurity and we have a

340
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:45,340
number of shared objectives with Anissa

341
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,260
and in terms of this competition we add

342
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,990
value I think to the steering committee

343
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,730
because where we have experience in

344
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:55,780
organizing events on a national event

345
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:58,440
and all particularly competitions many

346
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,030
of the countries that are thinking about

347
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,370
organizing the challenge do not have

348
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,799
this experience and they ask us for

349
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,780
advice

350
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,190
for exampie for example the Italians

351
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,039
were thinking about whether or not to

352
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,110
event to participate in the event and be

353
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:17,440
organisers and they were asking us about

354
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:19,299
logistical matters and matters of budget

355
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,330
and that's a very valuable advice that

356
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:25,210
we can give them this it's also a very

357
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,730
important room in in theory there's a

358
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:31,419
team working there we have a technical

359
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:35,950
office for European projects an office

360
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:39,400
for proposals for finance and in the

361
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:43,480
instance we are leaders for other

362
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:46,390
companies there's a European Director

363
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,309
for cybersecurity and we participate on

364
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:51,840
the legal side of that and so we have a

365
00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:56,980
solvent we're a solvent in entity and

366
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:00,070
greatly committed to the competition we

367
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,590
also have the role of selecting the team

368
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,990
as I was saying so how do we do this we

369
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:08,590
do this through national competitions

370
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:11,020
that happen in cyber camp cyber Olympics

371
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:14,830
hackathon and the individual

372
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:18,340
competitions we also have grants through

373
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,658
different conferences in Spain and the

374
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:24,320
winners of their CTF company

375
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:27,859
I have the right to go into the final

376
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:30,710
phase of the CTF individual phase in

377
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:33,799
cyber camp then the other thing is the

378
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,049
training we've been working on this for

379
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:39,129
the last few years it goes over a

380
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:42,830
two-week period and it deals with

381
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:45,830
technique and soft skills we prepare the

382
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,678
team when the technique to go into the

383
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:51,470
competition there are different

384
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,659
categories of challenges so we try and

385
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,840
find their strengths and weaknesses in

386
00:19:53,659 --> 00:20:01,190
the team with the aim of getting a

387
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:03,889
balanced team that can have good results

388
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:06,679
in competitions then we have the soft

389
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:09,080
skills which make you a better

390
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,499
professional should we say it's working

391
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:15,918
in team managing stress conflicts and

392
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:19,999
number of skills that are required by

393
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,739
companies also in cybersecurity and this

394
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:26,419
makes a quite a difference in the

395
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:28,580
selection processes so to get an idea of

396
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:31,039
what this training is like I'm going to

397
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,570
show you this which is the training

398
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,570
session that we have this year

it just wasn't just the training it was

407
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:15,870
the presentation video for that sir me

408
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:20,549
that opens the competition in Bucharest

409
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:24,059
and I'd like to go over the journey for

410
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:28,950
Spain in this competition it all began

411
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:31,379
in 2015 in Switzerland when a teen team

412
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:35,429
of young people that came from cyber

413
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:38,010
camp 2014 a long time ago it was first

414
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:42,899
one in Madrid and they went to

415
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:46,049
Switzerland to compete as Adrian was

416
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:49,979
saying it was a kind of a European Cup

417
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:52,230
for young talents in cybersecurity and

418
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,330
they were more and more national

419
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,529
competitions in different countries and

420
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:00,240
aneisa decided to arrange a competition

421
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:08,490
and to bring together all the talent in

422
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:10,440
Europe we did fairly well we were in

423
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:15,809
fourth position I think there were six

424
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:19,640
countries at the time in 2015 in 2016 we

425
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:22,649
had learnt a lot and we were able to win

426
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:27,360
we had a ray decisive technique right

427
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:29,250
from the start and people like or her

428
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:36,120
join the team people like a colossal

429
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:41,250
maria marcos and it truly was a very

430
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:44,459
satisfying year in 2017 we were the

431
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:49,140
winners from the previous year and we

432
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:52,049
took the double win home with us we had

433
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,240
a double challenge there to compete and

434
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:57,480
to arrange and also organized the cyber

435
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:03,090
gap tatiana will say it was a very

436
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:06,149
difficult in busy year in 2018 last year

437
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,539
it was my first year and we were in 11th

438
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:10,469
position

439
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:13,960
you might not see that because

440
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:17,109
originally we were in third position but

441
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,159
on the second day a number of situations

442
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:23,529
came across and that left us in 11th

443
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:28,059
position but I don't think it was a

444
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:31,080
reflection of the team role Resco is

445
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:33,879
here with us today in the front row

446
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,739
actually I've got all my bosses here in

447
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:39,939
the front row so this is like an exam

448
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:44,379
for me but he's the person who in a FIBA

449
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:48,159
has most believed in this project he had

450
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:49,928
to go early last time but this is a

451
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,099
little bit of a summary of our

452
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:54,789
participation in the European

453
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:56,830
competitions we have to tell you about

454
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:58,499
what happened this year just a few

455
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:04,658
months ago we were in Bucharest

456
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:06,849
competing and as the brand was saying it

457
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:11,409
was in the palace for the Parliament in

458
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:13,869
Bucharest it was a great place to be the

459
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:18,879
second largest government building after

460
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:21,449
their Pentagon and people who say that

461
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:24,699
you could see the building from the moon

462
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:34,119
but it's really quite amazing it's huge

463
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:36,820
and impressive there were some political

464
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:39,009
issues there specifically at the time so

465
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,220
it was a rather delicate and we were

466
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:48,099
there competing at the time so the

467
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:52,509
competition this year was a capture the

468
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:55,090
Jeopardy and exploiting and so on and

469
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:58,450
there were new categories like machine

470
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:01,749
learning probability mathematics and

471
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:04,210
radio honking this is an important part

472
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:06,369
of the competition last year we it is an

473
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,109
escape room and this is kind of

474
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:11,080
different everything else and it changes

475
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:13,139
every year there's flexibility for the

476
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,549
organising country

477
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:21,710
and it's really very interesting we had

478
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:24,780
dynamic scoring this year the number of

479
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:28,650
results depending on the participation

480
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:32,250
of each team and also the presentation

481
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:35,280
had to go in front of the jury and talk

482
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,840
to the jury and talk about one of the

483
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,350
challenge that they had resolved during

484
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:44,399
the competition there were 35 challenges

485
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:49,219
over two days some for the first day and

486
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:52,500
some for the second so this stops them

487
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:55,710
competing overnight and have some time

488
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:59,880
off the team members and I wanted to

489
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:01,559
show you a summary using a video and I

490
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,669
think this will show you exactly what

491
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,668
happened there in Bucharest

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:10,460
[Applause]

503
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:21,120
so this is a summary video of this year

504
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:24,930
and how the screens gone I'd like to say

505
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,459
hello to one friend of mine who is on

506
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,220
the steering committee in Bucharest she

507
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:37,190
was in the video so anything else I need

508
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:40,620
to tell you about my home this image

509
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:42,290
says a lot they often say that an image

510
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:46,080
is better than words

511
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:50,610
and this image is a summary of what

512
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:56,879
happened in the competition and we ended

513
00:30:50,610 --> 00:31:01,260
up in 13th position at the back this man

514
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,880
well Blanco and one of the coaches San

515
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,700
Diego my colleague and I'm there on the

516
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,440
left

517
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,510
this was midway through the competition

518
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:15,690
and we were out of the possibility of

519
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:16,980
winning but we you also learn from all

520
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:22,080
of this and that's what we have to take

521
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:24,270
away from this I'm sure that MTB we did

522
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,510
things wrong the model that we have

523
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:31,050
currently needs to evolve so that

524
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:33,180
spanking get back up there at the top in

525
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:36,000
the position that it deserves and I'd

526
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,770
like to reflect on this a little bit and

527
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,440
talk about how the competition has

528
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:43,430
evolved over the last few years there

529
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,860
has been a change in the quality of it

530
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:50,000
significantly there are lots of company

531
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:53,840
countries supporting their teams

532
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,400
training them the people from Poland

533
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,649
last year were six and now they were

534
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:03,300
fourth this year and other countries are

535
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:09,900
giving their team special training and

536
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:13,190
coaching a qur'anic from italy have not

537
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:15,559
done many CTF but they

538
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:18,049
did qualify for their for the

539
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:20,389
competition and they were seven they had

540
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:23,539
a lot of people supporting them so the

541
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:25,789
commitment of each team and each country

542
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:29,269
is increasing every year there are

543
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:31,190
creasing lis more resources and each

544
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:34,940
country tries to take their best people

545
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:38,149
because this competition which began as

546
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,460
a bit of fun should we say and to

547
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:43,309
promote talent has become a little bit

548
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:48,080
more professional now and countries

549
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:50,119
taking things very seriously very often

550
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,009
and this in particular I heard something

551
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:55,099
that this is like Eurovision Spain is

552
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:57,349
not what it used to be in fact behind

553
00:32:55,099 --> 00:33:00,859
the competition there is a lot of

554
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:04,158
dedication a lot of efforts people take

555
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:08,869
this very seriously and we don't like

556
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:12,320
losing we are also competitive in this

557
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:14,599
field we've learnt a lot from this we're

558
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:20,269
going to try and improve and take Spain

559
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:22,009
back up to the place where they this

560
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:24,289
maybe we could talk about in the

561
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:29,029
question around but I'm just going to

562
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:31,039
make it short but how do you get into

563
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:34,009
these Spanish national team you have to

564
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,408
be under 25 you have to have taken

565
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:38,359
national a part in national particular

566
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:39,590
composite competitions being tribal

567
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:46,728
Impex yeah

568
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:48,918
cyber careful hackathon some

569
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:54,710
requirements we need to have five good

570
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:56,330
news and five senior pre selection we

571
00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:00,129
have to have this into account as well

572
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:09,558
Junius is 18 to 20 and seniors is 20 to

573
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:11,270
25 there's a pre selection stage like to

574
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:17,000
have more people pre-selected so

575
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:19,280
everyone has assessment for every pan

576
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,010
stick and once we

577
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,100
have a profile every candidate then we

578
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:28,250
choose the final team they come to in

579
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,770
FIBA and they train for G so what

580
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,230
benefits can you get out of this it's a

581
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:36,620
unique opportunity

582
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:39,668

00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:47,658
European countries you will also have a

585
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:53,840
chance to complete part of the national

586
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:57,710
team and you will be able to train many

587
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:08,270
opportunities in gue German abroad you

588
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:13,150
can even compete in one the I'm going to

589
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:19,640
now give the floor to of today thank you

590
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:22,760
[Applause]

591
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:25,009
thank you very well no one could talk

592
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:29,900
more than me in Phoebus but he talks

593
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:35,720
more than me and faster to my right we

594
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:40,760
have Spanish national team 15 people in

595
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:48,020
that team and here at the Prado Malini

596
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:53,150
is senior in 2017 so he has been a

597
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:55,580
winner of the European 2018-2019 as well

598
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,890
and then we have an economy title who is

599
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,420
new to the team I would like to ask you

600
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,029
a few questions that you were not

601
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:04,190
expecting Diego prepared them so if he

602
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:06,440
hasn't told you about it it's his fault

603
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:09,080
I would like you to be an inspiration to

604
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:12,020
all those who would like to get into

605
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,090
this field of cybersecurity and I can

606
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,930
little tell us what did you stacking

607
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:20,180
interesting about this well since I was

608
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,810
very young I was always interested in

609
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:26,060
that

610
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:28,460
and computer science and it's true that

611
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:32,990
I've always liked gaming I was the

612
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:41,060
proper game I was always in denial

613
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:42,680
service attacks that I really liked

614
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,140
seeing and I was always curious about

615
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:48,049
how these things happened why they

616
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:52,670
happened and then I started hearing

617
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:55,600
about Wi-Fi Wi-Fi asshats web so you

618
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:57,770
start seeing a bit of everything really

619
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:03,920
because you don't know how things work

620
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:05,450
and you eventually find yourself doing

621
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,020
something that really draws your

622
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:10,910
attention and buys the category I am in

623
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,180
right now you start doing challenges

624
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:17,299
taking part in challenges you learn

625
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:20,660
little by little because obviously you

626
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:22,960
are not born knowing everything and you

627
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,390
learn something new in every competition

628
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,940
and that's how it works

629
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:32,390
other than you are also a professional

630
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:36,560
so when did you hobby become a

631
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:40,970
profession how did you manage in great

632
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,640
part thanks to this because this

633
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,740
experience is not only important and

634
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,080
it's not only satisfying on a personal

635
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,899
level but it gives you high visibility

636
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,540
as well it gives you also a contact

637
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,220
network you start going into the world

638
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,860
of cyber security which is we were

639
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,109
saying it's not very big and so it gives

640
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,380
you a chance to get people to know you

641
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:06,020
and to show your work so I think in a

642
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,540
way my current situation is due to

643
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:14,780
thanks to this and I am currently

644
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:18,680
working in blue live and I am in the red

645
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:20,390
team department that so what would you

646
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,009
recommend to a young person who wants to

647
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:26,779
specialize in cyber security doesn't

648
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:29,330
know how to go about it I would

649
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,660
recommend obviously poppy

650
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:34,279
studied the underwent training they

651
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,339
found a technical area they're

652
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,440
interested in and that they devote a lot

653
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,750
of time to that area because I was at

654
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,900
the end of the day where you won't make

655
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:47,320
a difference where you can start making

656
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:51,850
a difference and getting visibility

657
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,930
because if even if you cannot do

658
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,299
classroom courses you can do it online

659
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,069
because when you to know how to do

660
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:01,880
something but you devote time to it

661
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:03,230
until you manage to do it I think that

662
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:06,830
is very important you have that kind of

663
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:10,400
mindset yeah I think we're here saying

664
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:16,970
at the end of the day these competitions

665
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,800
do serve the purpose of helping you to

666
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,480
get acquainted with this kind of

667
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,630
learning if you someone who's

668
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,110
competitive who likes to win challenges

669
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:32,990
then this really helps and in my case

670
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:36,140
it's easier to learn like this because

671
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:37,580
you see a challenge you want to make

672
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,020
care you don't know how to do where you

673
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,480
find your documentation

674
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:43,550
you either work it out so you have to

675
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,430
wait for solutions to be polished and

676
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:48,440
that's where you really really learn and

677
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,930
obviously afterwards you have to learn

678
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,090
you have to do your formal training to

679
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:56,750
learn new techniques find documentation

680
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:58,369
but if we need to help you learn because

681
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,280
it makes it easier and it makes it more

682
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:04,070
fun and also to find what do you like

683
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,810
best because yeah you studying

684
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:09,800
engineering yeah I am doing engineering

685
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:12,680
right now a university also huge

686
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:20,660
mentioned that I'm you know before and

687
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:22,970
there is a nickname which cheese think

688
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:24,500
the main technical skills we have talked

689
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:27,830
about soft skills we've talked about

690
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:30,920
teamwork team building public speaking

691
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:33,470
speaking English but how about technical

692
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,650
skills what is the key to have good

693
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:38,040
performance for two dates in the

694
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:41,010
competition because

695
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,650
we have to bear in mind that when the

696
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:46,500
competition lasted one day we were doing

697
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:48,900
better but with two days it's becoming

698
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,420
more difficult for us well when it comes

699
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:54,000
to technical skills it really depends on

700
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,990
which category you are focusing on

701
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,820
because it isn't it is impossible to do

702
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:03,569
everything I'm not even talking about

703
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:07,460
cybersecurity I'm talking about CTS only

704
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:12,200
I think such skills is really really

705
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:17,880
important especially stress management

706
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:19,470
and also how you work with the rest of

707
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,690
the team what kind of relationship you

708
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:26,009
establish what communication policies

709
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:28,920
you establish what mechanism you have to

710
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:30,270
say listen I really cannot do this so

711
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,780
I'm going to move on to the next thing

712
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:36,800
that I think is what really determines

713
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:40,070
your act from in longer competitions

714
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:44,240
yeah I also think in order to be able to

715
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:47,340
do 16 hours in two days of competition

716
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:51,000
eight hours a day that you spend almost

717
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:54,330
completely in front of a screen I think

718
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,620
as I was saying other than technical

719
00:41:54,330 --> 00:42:01,380
skills which we understand everyone

720
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:06,390
asked what advanced technical skills if

721
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:10,380
they are on the team also has a big role

722
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:13,680
to play the way someone is the character

723
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:16,200
because when people are focused or doing

724
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,720
something it is really difficult or

725
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,140
people didn't like to therefore their

726
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,919
attention to be drawn to something else

727
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:28,279
I face bit with Adrian is saying it's

728
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,390
how you work with the team

729
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,000
[Music]

730
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:35,040
patience with the you are persistent

731
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,930
because if you want someone who gets

732
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,290
frustrated at the moment something

733
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:43,200
doesn't work out then you will end up

734
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:45,390
not really getting any challenge because

735
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,520
you something that you will never be

736
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:49,830
able to solve the first time you attempt

737
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:54,509
it you have to try and try on it so I

738
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:57,779
think the people who do Bessa challenges

739
00:42:54,510 --> 00:43:00,630
of those who like challenges who patient

740
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,760
and never stop trying until they make it

741
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:05,190
or even have the ability of say okay I'm

742
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,110
going to put this two aside and I'm

743
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:08,790
going to try and do another one and once

744
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,820
I've done that one I'll get back to this

745
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:14,940
one but yeah it's it's something about

746
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:17,340
soft skills is what su was saying no

747
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:20,100
Diego mentioned that really other teams

748
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:24,000
are improving that the level is higher

749
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:25,230
how do you think in the BB can help you

750
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,830
because we are the ones who are going to

751
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:32,400
select teams how can we help you improve

752
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:38,040
how have the other teams improved and we

753
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,780
have not I would imagine that training

754
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,759
is very important how we organize

755
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:44,460
training and for training to be more

756
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,560
constant rather than for it to be all

757
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,510
condensed in two weeks I think we should

758
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,130
have continuous challenges not only

759
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,530
because we would practice more but also

760
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,720
because we would practice practice more

761
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:57,900
as a team because at the other day this

762
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,029
is a team challenge everyone is focused

763
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,330
on their own computer but you are

764
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:05,340
playing as a team and I think that is

765
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:07,940
key and is something that should be

766
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,940
worked on a bit more

767
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:21,480
yeah I agree with with again because

768
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:23,790
it's not just two weeks or two days it

769
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,980
is something that has to be continuous

770
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:29,310
when whenever there's a CTF wish you'd

771
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,590
take part as a team if next week there's

772
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:34,190
another one then we'll shoot again take

773
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:36,690
part as a team if there's no continuity

774
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:41,099
then in two weeks is really

775
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:43,319
really difficult to proper training for

776
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:49,369
the challenge unless you have a method

777
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:49,369
background so you need constant work

778
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,319
some people might not be have much

779
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:59,700
practice or have not taken part in that

780
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:01,619
many challenges so they probably would

781
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,799
need to have more challenges to take

782
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:07,619
part in more challenges will do a CTF

783
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,619
this week then the next week we have

784
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:12,869
tests or you have to read this documents

785
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:16,730
we have to process these techniques I

786
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:20,460
think yeah continuity definitely improve

787
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:23,910
everyone's abilities and I think it

788
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,770
would improve our overall results the

789
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,569
other has to take have you taken down

790
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,690
yet that is what one of the first

791
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:32,730
lessons learned and we spoke to the

792
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:35,369
Germans who are very very

793
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:38,250
straightforward they invest a lot in

794
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:41,790
preselection but then during the year we

795
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:43,980
train constantly on their own they said

796
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:46,230
that most of them didn't even meet until

797
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:49,369
the first day of the competition but I

798
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:52,530
am certain that what they say about

799
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:57,690
constant work is definitely necessarily

800
00:45:52,530 --> 00:46:01,230
necessary we need to find signs of ways

801
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:03,119
of taking part in CDF's every week so

802
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:08,420
the team members get to know each other

803
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,420
and start working in an efficient manner

804
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:16,589
right so now they're all were saying

805
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:20,790
what we how we see it from the inside

806
00:46:16,589 --> 00:46:27,470
but now tell us why were you 13 what did

807
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:27,470
you end up 13 in these challenge well

808
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:35,680
about I mean

809
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:38,650
saying that there is change in

810
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:43,060
generations there were many good teams

811
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:46,480
before but how do you see that but it is

812
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,770
true that the team members are changing

813
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,250
oh it is his last year

814
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:55,060
in the competition by the way from my

815
00:46:51,250 --> 00:47:02,020
point of view the teams that take part

816
00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:05,320
in CTF in Spain it's true that they the

817
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:08,109
older teams play less and there are not

818
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,910
many new players in for example we've

819
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:14,560
seen the case of the Italians with

820
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:16,598
macaroni and their philosophy of who is

821
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,009
part of the team is very different here

822
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,500
it's just people who are passionate

823
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:22,570
about a cybersecurity and they chose on

824
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:25,300
their own decide to form a team whereas

825
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:28,180
at hockey Ronnie for example they have a

826
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:32,260
team of teams from university so

827
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:33,970
universities create CTF teams that

828
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,839
aren't already very advanced and then

829
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:40,529
that gives you a mechanism of natural

830
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:43,660
handover from generation to generation

831
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:45,760
because everyone starts in the

832
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:49,299
university teams and then they have a

833
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,010
really really good team of teams and I

834
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,040
think that is something that we should

835
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:57,430
really think about and incentivize as a

836
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:00,609
country now about what happened this

837
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:03,390
year in the competition I think it was

838
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:06,009
mostly to do with the fact that

839
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:08,200
specifically this year the my half in a

840
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:12,369
category where we would have needed to

841
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:15,549
have someone who knew more about but

842
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:17,950
also training it really has nothing to

843
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,680
do with the competition looks like three

844
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:22,799
four years ago and what it is like now

845
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,390
because it's a much more professional

846
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,010
continuous training is very important

847
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:29,950
many other countries are doing it and

848
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,750
we're not and that makes a big

849
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,270
difference because they are much better

850
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:36,490
prepared for the challenge than we are

851
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:39,280
maybe in the past when they were leave

852
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:42,089
less countries and they were not taking

853
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,920
it so seriously maybe the innate

854
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:47,710
challenge and challenge wasn't off but I

855
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,410
don't think it's the case nowadays well

856
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:53,500
I can tell that from here and fever is

857
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:57,129
really committed you will see tomorrow

858
00:48:53,500 --> 00:49:00,430
it'd be individual city a final we have

859
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:02,109
had many new things that you will see

860
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,690
tomorrow I'm not going to give them away

861
00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:07,810
but we are really trying to get onto

862
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:10,570
these new tendencies categories

863
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:12,970
challenges well you'll see tomorrow I

864
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:15,339
don't know if the audience has any

865
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:20,230
questions before we open the question

866
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:22,450

867
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:24,910

the rest of the team to come on the

869
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:30,160

870
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:31,598
and they have they had to come today

871
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,950
although they're competing tomorrow and

872
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,490

Danielle who is from Asturias believes

885
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:55,098
in Valencia people have not been able to

886
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:58,490
make it today some members of the team

887
00:50:55,099 --> 00:51:00,680
these are our year's national team we

888
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:04,640
have many people behind them last year

889
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:07,009
we had 10 people and I would like to say

890
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:11,420

now make the most of it because that

897
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:32,440

00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:32,440

904
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:02,149

00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:20,299
absolutely wonderful and I encourage

912
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,089
women to do this because this is a

913
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:26,089
unique experience and I think we have

914
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:28,339
exactly the same abilities as men to do

915
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:30,490

919
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:45,490
shy so let's see what he says I think

920
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:47,830
this is really a very good opportunity

921
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:52,180
because you get to know people who share

922
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:54,730
your passions and it's a way of finding

923
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:56,680
emerging talent in Europe so I was

924
00:52:54,730 --> 00:53:00,730

925
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:03,009
cybersecurity to enroll to show their

926
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:05,470
