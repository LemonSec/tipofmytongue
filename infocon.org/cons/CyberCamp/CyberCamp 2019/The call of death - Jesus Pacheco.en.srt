[Music]

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:14,879
okay good afternoon thank you all for

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,340
being here the surveillance that you

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,240
like your mother a lot more let's see

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,330
they call this afternoon I'm sure you

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,209
curious about why I'm holding this will

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,909
see that the end start we've got a bit

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,820
of an index here with the seven points

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,790
that we're going to cover so first of

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,780
all what is all of this about I'll give

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,079
a little bit of an explanation I'll tell

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:47,190
you all about the workshop I'll tell you

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:51,329
about voice-over-internet protocol so

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,800
that you can million with that and what

15
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,410
we're going to see because we're going

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,559
to see it right through the process

17
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:01,218
we'll talk about IOT Internet of Things

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,218
devices

19
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:09,720
it's a na VI device and we're going to

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,908
use Arduino as well the two systems then

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:18,890
we'll set up a telephone switchboards

22
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:21,060
and wheels install it on the only I will

23
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,570
see a little bit about the commands and

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:29,729
scripts how it works and we'll play with

25
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:33,119
our switchboard a little port so we can

26
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,549
put the manuscript into play and then

27
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:40,229
last of all we have got the whole of

28
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:43,920
death last of all we have some advice

29
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:50,539
and countermeasures to protect ourselves

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:54,990
from attacks of this kind so let's begin

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:57,899
so it's a beginner workshop so we're not

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,240
going to go into great detail from a

33
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:04,500
technical point of view so that

34
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,250
everybody can understand whether you've

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,889
got a lot of knowledge or not know I

36
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,120
guess it's time I can hello so any

37
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,738
system that has

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,040
being rated you can give it more

39
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:21,060
functions than the ones that being said

40
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:26,010
over for yeah we're going beyond the

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:28,769
barriers to get greater information and

42
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,859
knowledge this is basically the

43
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:34,260
definition that I have given to this so

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,049
a hacker is somebody who is interested

45
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,720
in getting most of the technology and

46
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:45,239
the means around them to create new

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,670
routes or things that people have not

48
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,799
achieved before a hacker can know about

49
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,730
programming design network systems

50
00:02:49,799 --> 00:03:00,150
electronics physics chemistry psychology

51
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:06,209
anybody can be anybody can do it no

52
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:10,140
battle I compare in the real world with

53
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:12,060
a super hero don't really have

54
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,809
superpowers but in the real world it

55
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,109
would be a hacker to do so this is the

56
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:24,690
boring bit I'm afraid I may go level

57
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:27,269
Phoebe let's start with e V oh I P voice

58
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:31,019
over Internet Protocol or silicon your

59
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:35,720
mom VoIP is the acronym for voiceover

60
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:38,419
inaudible and it just means that the

61
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,540
technology that we currently have

62
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:45,989
through which telecoms were dated

63
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:50,429
telecoms voice that we've always used it

64
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:55,109
has turned into something we can use

65
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:58,129
over a data line we had analog lines

66
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:00,900
such as the phone that we have here

67
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:02,399
distance and data

68
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,769
I thought you meant that a lot more amps

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,769
and then we had Motown

70
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,599
there's thought it's cool okay I'm going

71
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:13,530
through this we can use it to control a

72
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,629
switchboard well no well of these

73
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,380
positive O's and I love it goes so can

74
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:24,620
we use analog devices the answer is yes

75
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:32,419
so through the VoIP if we go back a

76
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:35,060
second you either need an IP or a IP

77
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:38,030
phone through software can be physical

78
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,270
or a program on your smart phone or your

79
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:44,510
computer either uses this service for

80
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:52,669
example what server or what's up video

81
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:58,580
calls is VoIP so the old devices there

82
00:04:52,669 --> 00:05:00,620
you have several examples I'm sure you

83
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,550
guys have them at home or you've seen

84
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,290
the back some time kind of old telephone

85
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,750
and the one you can see at the bottom is

86
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:12,250
actually the one we have here today so

87
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:15,890
all of these devices can still be used

88
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:19,250
thanks to one of these devices but does

89
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:22,580
the conversion from analog to digital or

90
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:25,850
digital to analog there are a number of

91
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,680
ports and Ethernet ports that does the

92
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,610
connection to the internet or to the

93
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:36,979
network and then it has these aspects o

94
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:38,960
or FX and some connections and this goes

95
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:43,630
from the digital lines here to the

96
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,640
analog or the analog line to the digital

97
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:51,200
you can confer get it in a switchboard

98
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:55,190
in order to be able to use that so let's

99
00:05:51,200 --> 00:06:05,210
see the Internet of Things devices so we

100
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:10,120
have many p.i computers devices little

101
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:13,250
computers with a single board computers

102
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,860
and you can see an expansion of land on

103
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:20,810
the internet as in the paragraph we can

104
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:22,480
see up here raspberry pi were the ones

105
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,940
who initiated

106
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,810
these kind of devices and they set them

107
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:31,830
up for teaching purposes for teaching

108
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,560
programming computing in schools

109
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,719
secondary schools and so on now its use

110
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,440
has extended a lot especially in the

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:46,060
world of hacking maker projects in

112
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,890
robotics so the use of yum has been

113
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:53,200
extended from what it was initially or

114
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:56,200
created for so as well as raspberry many

115
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:02,370
other different manufacturers and each

116
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:06,580
has their own version we happen on a PI

117
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:08,410
so if you just use search using the term

118
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,300
then you'll find many many there are

119
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,660
different kinds of design different

120
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,660
processors different and if you go by

121
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:21,880
memory and the one that I have chosen is

122
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:23,800
a nano model it's the one that you can

123
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,750
see down here you can see there the

124
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,780
plate at the top and then the apparatus

125
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:33,160
for gonna add the bottom it's a little

126
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:36,849
bit bigger than the size of I'm not it's

127
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,340
made of aluminium the housing and it's

128
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:44,890
quite powerful even though it's very

129
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:46,750
small it's got 1 gig of ram memory

130
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:54,849
you look it's not oh my oh my a firm a

131
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:57,640
and the ethernet has one so it has a lot

132
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,920
of power more than what we need for what

133
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,300
we're going to do here you can also list

134
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:08,530
a Mac so we have these game the diagram

135
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:10,600
of that plate these plates have a number

136
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:14,500
of different connections that we can use

137
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:19,350
in our projects it's got a card reader

138
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:23,110
your inputs into both ports without that

139
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:25,800
which are the ones that we need to send

140
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,910
and receive information from the device

141
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,910
so in those minutes

142
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,450
on the outside you can see that there is

143
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,740
a display where you can see different

144
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:43,570
things and there are three little

145
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:46,600
buttons on them so the image on the

146
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:53,530
display and the use of those buttons is

147
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:55,180
programmed here in these pins so in the

148
00:08:53,530 --> 00:09:02,140
pins here you could connect pretty much

149
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:06,969
anything we could use anything we've got

150
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:09,220
an example of use here and using this

151
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,920
little screw demo that you can see we

152
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,790
could turn it on and turn it off or

153
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,329
connector relay connect it to a domotic

154
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,459
system to use this apparatus and just

155
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,980
with a little bit of programming oh and

156
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,810
something has gone a little wrong here

157
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:31,960
oh it's back now it's just the cable

158
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:33,939
connection I'm sorry about that we could

159
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,540
connect pretty much any device a camera

160
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:44,620
for example and there are many projects

161
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:46,599
that connect and it's used for my a face

162
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,770
recognition and so on for many different

163
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:55,030
uses any of you know a little bit about

164
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:58,840
programming this script is very simple

165
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:03,760
here the show business but VI LED don't

166
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:08,500
py and it's only got a few lines there

167
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:12,550
we just import the recognition library

168
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,940
from the play which is the most bumpy

169
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,160
high dose GPIO

170
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,020
thing you know we do a copy of theme and

171
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,550
one time model and then we have a

172
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:29,410
variable where we say the pin number

173
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:33,939
that we're going to use you can see in

174
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:39,969
the image that we need three papers for

175
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:43,480
the infeed so it was being through then

176
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:47,420
before pin CPI for

177
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:50,540
pin 6 and pin 7 which which is where we

178
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:55,189
send the command so basically that's the

179
00:10:50,540 --> 00:11:00,790
switch so we create a loop commando

180
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:03,290
where we're waiting for the code so the

181
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,630
commands actually program around a

182
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:10,760
little bit later on but we're making a

183
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:15,400
loop here to say turn on and turn off so

184
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:20,000
this is just the honor in programming

185
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:23,300
until we cancel the script so down the

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,020
bottom if you're familiar with this once

187
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:29,810
it's created and stored then we have the

188
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:39,860
execution permission and we can execute

189
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:42,260
that box so many of you will have come

190
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,710
as a result of the communications that

191
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,260
we have made of or receive our lobbies

192
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,950
it's an honorable PI that we've

193
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:55,430
integrated some tools that come with

194
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:59,060
line X and we've created a hand device

195
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:01,550
that can be used for pen testing here's

196
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:06,890
a little bit of details about that but

197
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:11,449
the device in addition to these tools

198
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:14,360
you could connect through line X we have

199
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:18,280
also added some functions to the

200
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:22,310
apparatus for control of the buttons

201
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:25,819
once we've controlled programs an mp3

202
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:28,790
device we can do pause or increase the

203
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:33,710
volume and so on in this case we've

204
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:38,380
programmed it so that we can say if we

205
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,380
want to do Network scan the type of scan

206
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:46,640
and we can collect the packets of

207
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:51,110
traffic to which we're connected we can

208
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,189
export through the USB ports use the

209
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:57,120
menu to select

210
00:12:53,190 --> 00:13:00,950
that export onto the drive that we're

211
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,440
using an external drive and in the photo

212
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:09,990
there is an example of how it has been

213
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:13,580
used it's a battery and the device is

214
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:17,160
connected to that the nano PI device

215
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:21,000
telephone that is connected to the nano

216
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:25,709
PI and on the Left we have a Wi-Fi

217
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:32,340
repeater a USB memory but it's got a

218
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:34,050
Wi-Fi server and the mobile are

219
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,700
connected to that so they're all

220
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,120
interconnected and once you've done that

221
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:42,170
you can start working to look into

222
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:47,160
networks or whatever job you need to do

223
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:50,969
this is a simulated way you're in a

224
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,530
place where you should don't want people

225
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,060
to know what they're doing if you're in

226
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:57,569
a company and you don't just want them

227
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,910
to realize you can put this device in

228
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:02,730
your pocket and you can continue working

229
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,620
with your mobile phone and there would

230
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:08,520
be no suspicion that you're analyzing

231
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,660
the network in that company so that you

232
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:15,510
can issue a report for that company so

233
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,360
you can see what employees are doing in

234
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:20,370
a different moment because people would

235
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,140
not suspect that you're there to do that

236
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,400
job it just seems that you're working

237
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,990
with your mobile when people are on the

238
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,010
computer they may be looking at Facebook

239
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:34,730
or doing other private things so it's a

240
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,240
great option to do this kind of

241
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,010
investigation even when you're actually

242
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,210
physically in the company with other

243
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:47,900
people resize realizing so you can see

244
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:51,110
changes in behavior on this occasion

245
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:56,360
what we're going to do is

246
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:57,820
to use the nano pie with a home

247
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,459
switchboard

248
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:05,810
we'll use the Asterix system and we'll

249
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:07,939
do it directly on the screen so that you

250
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:12,260
can see it has sufficient power to

251
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:18,350
manage a voice system in a company this

252
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:25,640
could easily manage this any kind of

253
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:28,370
regular company in standard roles and we

254
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,649
can configure everything so with just

255
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:37,640
one device it's efficient we don't need

256
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:40,399
any kind of huge system just with this a

257
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:44,060
piece of apparatus we have enough in

258
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,070
order to be able to work so let's have a

259
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,569
look at our do we know now how do we

260
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:56,120
know more comment I have included

261
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:59,630
Arduino because this is a beginners this

262
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,010
is a beginners class and we're going to

263
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,980
have a little bit of a look at

264
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:08,449
everything in terms of electronics in

265
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:11,810
dramatics actually we don't actually

266
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:14,060
need Arduino here for what we have have

267
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:17,930
you without a piece of apparatus we have

268
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:21,018
sufficient to do what we want to do but

269
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:23,829
I wanted to add something extra so we

270
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:29,420
can see how our do we know works as well

271
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:34,489
so what is not we know plate it's plate

272
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:36,110
with a programmable micro controller and

273
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:41,810
we can do pretty much whatever we want

274
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:44,510
with that free hardware open-source

275
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,099
hardware and there are different

276
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,519
connections between the microcontroller

277
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,790
and the different sensors so that we can

278
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,800
use it in a very simple manner to test

279
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,769
new designs and create new projects

280
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,019
without needing to invest initially in

281
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:06,339
Spencer prototypes or

282
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:09,319
nice plates can be pretty expensive

283
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:13,579
initially because any project that you

284
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:17,299
do you have to buy the plates there's no

285
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:21,589
system that is ready that I can use

286
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:23,240
functioning and operation quickly to see

287
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,240
everything that I want to do and do

288
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,669
plenty of tests

289
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:33,580
now with this I can send the information

290
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:37,399
to the manufacturer so what we achieve

291
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:39,049
with this device is exactly that and we

292
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:45,590
save a lot of money which is great for

293
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:46,879
company homemade device and with these

294
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:52,870
kinds of things you can do pretty much

295
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:55,340
anything you want at home hackers do

296
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,799
many things with these kind of devices

297
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,980
I'm sure you look at that on YouTube and

298
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:04,510
they can do pretty much anything they

299
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:07,669
can do almost magic device like this

300
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:10,929
there are many times of Arduino plates

301
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:18,850
how do we know know Leonardo mega

302
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:18,850
lilypad and some have Bluetooth included

303
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:28,340
bTW but the difference between them is

304
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:31,539
the number of ports memory capacity in

305
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:35,408
the microcontroller and based on the

306
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:39,860
memory can do bigger or smaller projects

307
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:41,539
the format and also the size but the

308
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,139
functions are pretty much the same in

309
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:44,990
all of them

310
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:48,439
some of them have different options than

311
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:55,760
others so how do we program our do we

312
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:59,929
know it's basically an application that

313
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,450
you can use to select the Arduino plate

314
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:06,080
that we have got and you can write in

315
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:09,980
the code once that is done we have the

316
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:13,010
option to upload the program that we

317
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,970
have done on to the memory if

318
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:20,020
device and wanted have been uploaded it

319
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:24,010
is programs and we can use it to work

320
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:27,320
this is free it's open and available

321
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:31,220
platforms their new version just came

322
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:34,370
out in fact so the code that we going to

323
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,580
upload on to the Arduino plate this is

324
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,929
what you're going to see in the workshop

325
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:42,379
we're just going to do something with

326
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:48,890
the plate now so we're just controlling

327
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:53,540
one pin the option so through the serial

328
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,580
connection this is where you can

329
00:19:53,540 --> 00:20:00,230
establish a connection between the

330
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:03,740
computer and the device we're just going

331
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:06,170
to set up a loop in which the Arduino

332
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,080
just waits for the communications

333
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:14,600
through the USB port it's going to be

334
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:18,860
waiting two things either a 1 or a 2 so

335
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:23,060
when it gets the 1 it will start up the

336
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:25,429
feed but is online so we allow the power

337
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:31,909
to go through and when it's on 2 which

338
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:37,370
is a well it's like a swing will be told

339
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:39,950
to switch on a switch with this for

340
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,600
example if we connected it through to

341
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,400
our lighting system at home then we

342
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,679
would have a switch that we could

343
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:52,450
control from computer web interface and

344
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,450
we could control it with a mobile phone

345
00:20:53,050 --> 00:21:04,520
coding is very easy connection wait and

346
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:10,100
the loop is waiting to receive oneness

347
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:12,920
but now how do we deal with relays we're

348
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,409
going to see a relay because what I want

349
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:23,220
is to show different devices and

350
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:29,789
electronics so relay is a suite as well

351
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:36,000
it separate from the power or the

352
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:39,480
devices great its greatest advantages is

353
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,390
that with very Reno new contests come on

354
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:47,190
with a very small system with three

355
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,770
points for example without much power I

356
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,650
can turn on and off that switch and I

357
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:59,789
can help anything connected to it I can

358
00:21:52,650 --> 00:22:06,080
have connected with battery 20 volt and

359
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:06,080
even something in 220 up to 10 amperes

360
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:17,659
Yamaha and now let's create our asterisk

361
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:20,129
which holds what is asterisk VPO

362
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:27,690
asterism problem I saw for delivery it's

363
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:30,809
an resource from the US and it gives you

364
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,280
all the functionality of switch onto our

365
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:35,879
computer regardless of the kind of

366
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:38,460
computer it is computer onto a

367
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:46,650
switchboard with if absolutely every

368
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:53,580
single functionality is that it also

369
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:58,020
allows you to unified voice IP GSM and

370
00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:02,820
PSTN everything we have right now be it

371
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:07,250
Wireless oh you can unify in just one

372
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:11,549
device this is very widely used

373
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:13,140
companies because it has many

374
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:21,299
functionalities and it's not very

375
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:25,679
expensive the most expensive thing that

376
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:27,870
a company would one neat to her store

377
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,600
asterisk is the configuration because it

378
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,360
barely needs any software or hardware he

379
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,379
said I only gonna be with us now

380
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,709
installation and configuration those of

381
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,360
you

382
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,549
have your laptop's with you if you're

383
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,520
connected to the Wi-Fi then you can

384
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:44,010
start trying we can go about this in

385
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,240
different ways I might come on one of

386
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:53,640
the most ways to download the post-race

387
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:57,450
from the makers website you've got the

388
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:02,149
bottom G slash downloads you can see all

389
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:06,960
available versions there quite a few

390
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:10,489
simultaneously right now one of them new

391
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:16,169
is options which is beta it's not being

392
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:20,370
produced yes and then you have the older

393
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:26,570
versions as well now you can

394
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:26,570
as I was saying I'm elated decompile it

395
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:37,110
depending on using asterisk by the way

396
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:39,750
is designed for line you can do them

397
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:46,500
apt-get install asterisk Oh yum install

398
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:48,630
asterisk depending on what you like

399
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,460
using this option because you cannot

400
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,590
choose what is going to be installed the

401
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,220
system is going gemsto there's anything

402
00:24:52,590 --> 00:25:00,270
that's on the repository on the Linux

403
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:02,760
system that you have 16 on the Rufus

404
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:06,240
tree there's only version 13 and so

405
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:09,299
there will be different so what I

406
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:20,159
usually recommend is to download it

407
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:26,309
directly from the important creations

408
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:38,149
with its more most important for us as

409
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:40,799
you can see here files are all in acha

410
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:43,678
depending on the configuration with one

411
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,440
or the other out of this second one is

412
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,890
an evolution of

413
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:53,700
we can configure tension tension Strunk

414
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:56,730
lines and as IP lines attend both with

415
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:02,430
ten seven suppose then I would configure

416
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:05,520
them on the now if I have a nineteen

417
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:07,590
telephone provider with one or two nines

418
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,490
and I would introduce a configuration on

419
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:14,129
that file to then we have extensions

420
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:20,030
that's where we come figure the dial

421
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:26,190
plan is really the cool of asterisk

422
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:29,220
yesterday's now on extensions dot-com is

423
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:32,880
where we're going to do in detail

424
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,380
everything that such board is going to

425
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,640
do that's what we're going to detail

426
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:40,560
what it's going to do we have features

427
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,250
Donna comments if this is where we have

428
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:48,480
additional parameters and punches which

429
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:53,160
is dialing waiting time background music

430
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,770
and then we've got manager we configure

431
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,150
uses and permissions with access to the

432
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:02,310
ami and we'll see later what ami is and

433
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:07,500
for me this is the most important thing

434
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:11,490
of what we're going to choose today and

435
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:13,650
then we've got folders voices and sounds

436
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:17,250
so you have in the switchboard they are

437
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:20,580
on that /lib slash asterisks a royal

438
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:26,580
slash sounds the role in English and you

439
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:31,020
can also you could have the switchboard

440
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:34,919
on widow and what you want then you as a

441
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:37,740
live asterisks modules we have libraries

442
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:41,700
applications and modules there are many

443
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:44,180
many folders and then revoir - slash log

444
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,650
slash asterisk is where all the locks

445
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,640
generated by the switchboard are going

446
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:52,200
to be saved

447
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:56,970
weird calls that I made

448
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,550
Bayless everything and anything it lets

449
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:03,600
you watch people now

450
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:11,100
same combo file here you have a general

451
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:15,300
part we're going to be used by all the

452
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:17,850
extensions that we Lord lasers and we

453
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,280
have an extension middle part as you can

454
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,719
see there in the center and we're going

455
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,550
to right first of all what does common

456
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:30,810
to all extensions and then we configure

457
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:32,850
one by example I know so I can have

458
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,370
extension thousand and three thousand

459
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,899
and two thousand three four you can have

460
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,330
whatever configuration you want by the

461
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,760
way and then each user will have a

462
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:45,000
caller ID which can be a number or a

463
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,050
convenient name thousand one two

464
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:55,260
thousand two Danielle

465
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:57,120
now secret is password lat because I

466
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,770
have a security event I would like to

467
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,350
use the most famous password of them all

468
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:04,260
one two three four which is the one me

469
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:08,459
never should use by the way LT was then

470
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:12,030
spawn talk now extensions this is as I

471
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,830
was saying the call you will always have

472
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,899
a general part here as well we're not

473
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:20,070
going to go into detail on all the lines

474
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:22,230
because there is a lot of things and you

475
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:24,360
might get more but if you do want

476
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,880
information you just look out an

477
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:33,620
asterisk on the internet and you will

478
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:37,410
find tutorials so we're going to

479
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,909
configure is a default that's what we're

480
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,730
going to do by default when we get a

481
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:45,180
call as you can see here at the

482
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:48,020
beginning there's an answer go what are

483
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:55,550
you next time then this and external

484
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:57,690
regional tiles before we have configured

485
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,310
thousand one thousand two

486
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:02,370
here we are missing

487
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:05,040
zero but it so it shouldn't be / 101 it

488
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:08,250
should be / thousand and one and then

489
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:11,460
after answering they would hang up now

490
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:14,430
we would have configured to outgoing

491
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:17,880
this well two blocks extension which is

492
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:19,680
what manages calls between extensions

493
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,100
within the company and then services

494
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:27,140
which is where you can have new number

495
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,139
of contracts or telephone number oh

496
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:36,060
hello world if we call one two three

497
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:39,360
from our phone then we will get an

498
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:42,929
answer with voice saying hello world if

499
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,360
we have the time of service and we dial

500
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:47,880
four and three then we will get a nice

501
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,229
the same today is this day on this month

502
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:55,050
and it is this time and then I mean you

503
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:57,210
can prove them anything you want here if

504
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:59,220
you have an internet service where you

505
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:00,930
can check the web which for example in a

506
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:06,600
specific location you can create too

507
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:09,390
many of that website depending on the

508
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,340
codes that you send though it can tell

509
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,830
you what the weather is like all other

510
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,280
motorways are like depending on the

511
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:19,530
numbers the and then when it comes to

512
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,720
commands and scripts its execution with

513
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:24,360
the I believe our menu which is the one

514
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:29,700
we have prepared the one we're going to

515
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,979
look into in so we have prepared a

516
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:37,140
telephone number many of you will know

517
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:41,760
it already when we call that number and

518
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:44,580
it executes voice menu typical welcome

519
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,020
to here and so please press 1 for this

520
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:49,439
please press 2 for that

521
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:53,070
once we've accessed that many then we

522
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,520
have a weight loss awaiting time to dial

523
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:59,820
the option that we want to choose please

524
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:02,760
press 1 sales department for Institute

525
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:07,159
for technical support department and so

526
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,669
on so in our case we have configured it

527
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:13,379
away

528
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:17,279
if we press one we activate our do in

529
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:19,799
her exit to Eden activate about even

530
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,350
exit so we could beat sending on an

531
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:25,859
officer you know and what have we

532
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:29,189
achieved with this that telephone

533
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:32,158
switchboard in the place thousands of

534
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,619
miles away from me I can turn on and off

535
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,399
the lights in my company all the alarm

536
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:41,070
for example without even needing to use

537
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,830
the internet I just make a phone call I

538
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,840
call my company and spinning on why i

539
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:51,720
dial on my menu I turn the lights on and

540
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,850
off or I activate the I just need a

541
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,220
normal telephone connection by the way

542
00:32:53,850 --> 00:33:02,039
not even the internet is ever saying in

543
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:08,249
love your own trace option we execute a

544
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:10,440
script am i a map and the network says

545
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:13,379
we're already starting to do things

546
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,830
without even needing our computer so I

547
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:19,109
can do an end map onto a network and see

548
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,149
which map machines that liveth and plan

549
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:24,119
work reports are being sent and I can

550
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:33,389
say that send back to copy paste begin

551
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:36,269
your para Metro parameter on the website

552
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:43,559
I can find them so there will be one of

553
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:46,350
the options right option Agia execution

554
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:49,379
and the final option we are executing

555
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:50,908
here self-destruction what command so

556
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:54,408
the need evidence

557
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:56,399
with these device which we could have

558
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:59,429
connected anywhere by the way this can

559
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:03,840
be used with good obviously you want to

560
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:06,929
use it for bad you can just connect this

561
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,699
with an IP telephone yes a colon or

562
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:12,540
configured listing on your switchboard

563
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:15,058
and you can connect all high that

564
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,340
divides within my comedy network or if

565
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:20,440
you didn't have access to the network

566
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:22,870
connected remotely through the Wi-Fi and

567
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,639
just hide the device on an external part

568
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,159
that has connected on to the Wi-Fi for

569
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,080
that company you didn't even have to get

570
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,040
physically into the company to see to

571
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,989
connect to their network

572
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,029
imagine that remotely without even

573
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,189
needing internet connection you can do a

574
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:44,950
pen testing depending on what you

575
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:47,620
program device once you've done all

576
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:50,319
those working options and configurations

577
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:54,790
within your network then you can

578
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,800
self-destruct a hugely device as the

579
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:59,320
years be killer connected you can

580
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,170
activate the USB killer so you would

581
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,720
just literally kill the machine so there

582
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:07,060
would be nothing to investigate or to

583
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,910
learn from that device no one could know

584
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:12,570
what that devices done now this kind of

585
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:15,399
attack would you consist this you know

586
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:18,640
hiding this kind of device maybe you

587
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:24,460
have seen a TV a couple of years ago

588
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:27,160
there was an attack on a service where

589
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,590
in one of that connection on that and

590
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:35,830
once the different cables of network

591
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:37,390
knishes there was a DP device hidden

592
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:40,990
which was they had all the connections

593
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:43,720
and send them Jews God knows where when

594
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:46,180
you got in thicket so this would be the

595
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,390
same principle you would have an

596
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,910
advantage which is by using an

597
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,560
analogical telephone device which then

598
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,480
self-destructs there would be nothing to

599
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,360
analyze because you know even using an

600
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:01,090
internet connection because the other

601
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,590
day you can trace internet connections

602
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:06,160
they might be more difficult on this

603
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:10,590
difficult depending on what I am a fool

604
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:14,620
but you can eventually trace it you know

605
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:17,310
now picture someone executes this sort

606
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:20,500
of attack on a remote place in Australia

607
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:23,650
that's it where there's only a telephone

608
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:26,370
box there's no internet connection of

609
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,370
any kind

610
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:35,879
company is victim of the company that

611
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:37,379
has received they launched an

612
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,950
investigation the only thing that they

613
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:44,400
could is that they have received an

614
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:47,730
imminent attack the person who has

615
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,950
avenged my launch the attack via phone

616
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:53,220
will never be traced

617
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:57,509
Oh imagine instead of a USB killer you

618
00:36:53,220 --> 00:37:04,680
have an exploding device and this would

619
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:09,540
be where we haven't really thought about

620
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,558
that much is two types of technology so

621
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,089
this is something that can be very

622
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,430
powerful when use for good but very

623
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:16,920
dangerous we need them on the back in

624
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:23,299
their face then we have command-line

625
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,300
interface now as today well switch

626
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:38,578
everything data and from that commands

627
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:42,509
line we can we put a switchboard stop

628
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:44,190
then we can see configure sli's stop

629
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,750
them and see how they're working so we

630
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,569
can see basically everything that's

631
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:57,000
going on in real time and then we'll see

632
00:37:48,569 --> 00:38:00,599
how how it works yeah

633
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:04,530
and now let's that fit link with sport

634
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:07,579
and pain now how can we interact within

635
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:12,000
the risk switch Baltimore first of all

636
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:16,349
we can work with AGI asterisk gateway

637
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,420
interface and here we have everything

638
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:24,390
works and we can use it can be a Java

639
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:26,910
Python php.net and with this library and

640
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,098
the Astro skate wake in phase welcome to

641
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:31,589
this interactive from different

642
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:33,990
programming languages with the actual

643
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:37,110
switchboard we have to take into account

644
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:40,229
the working through AGI is a bit limited

645
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:42,930
in a way because we depend upon use of

646
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:45,240
permissions from switchboard

647
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:47,430
so usually you switch but asterisk is

648
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,120
not going to have Rock permissions

649
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:54,509
because otherwise this would like to be

650
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:57,839
securities if you faith so if we use AGI

651
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:00,120
and we ask it to execute certain things

652
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,760
then we need role permissions because

653
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:08,520
asterisk is annoyed it's not going to

654
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:14,660
work this is a way the week and I said

655
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:20,690
ok anymore and we won t we would need

656
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:20,690
use rather the device configuration

657
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:33,270
files configuration and permissions so

658
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:35,310
this is not useful for what we want so

659
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:38,940
we would need much more configuration so

660
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:43,400
how would we actually if we want

661
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:53,850
automate exploit me test closed and yeah

662
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:58,620
that would be discrete n comma AGI and

663
00:39:53,850 --> 00:40:01,290
then we would scrape this the

664
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:03,299
switchboard would execute that skrilla

665
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,650
with the telephone number if we have

666
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,860
permissions obviously otherwise you

667
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:10,260
wouldn't do anything

668
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:18,630
now how about command and script

669
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:20,970
execution system and the command in

670
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:23,610
brackets and we would write it in

671
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:27,680
exactly the same way that we have it the

672
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:30,630
9x command line and then we have

673
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,419
additional functions which allow us to

674
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:36,000
interact with data that the switchboard

675
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:42,120
is generating here on the second example

676
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,040
the fence one is just to reload wait a

677
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,109
second

678
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,720
example what we are doing with the

679
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:53,030
system command is fine caller ID

680
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,959
dollar signs a long time what we're

681
00:40:53,030 --> 00:41:00,740
doing is recovering coal ID you have the

682
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:04,099
time and the date and redirect that to

683
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:09,319
the serial port play say we have a

684
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:10,760
display on this serial I'm making sure

685
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:12,770
the information anyone it takes for

686
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,920
example so every time someone calls I

687
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:18,680
would see on my screen telephone number

688
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:24,290
of the Tyson who's calling the date the

689
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:26,569
time so this would be a call well you

690
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:30,589
can also execute with the whole route

691
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:32,869
with with the system command if you want

692
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:35,420
to execute any script of any time you

693
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:37,760
can have a program to yourself we you

694
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:43,000
have to introduce the whole route by the

695
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:45,560
way here we've got home user documents

696
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:51,319
lash I did like this and everyone is

697
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:55,910
home users so it depends on the

698
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:57,650
permissions that we have from Asterix so

699
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,629
if we execute something that give us a

700
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,520
Sarah then it's going going to do it it

701
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,400
has to be previously configured we could

702
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,440
do this but it's more complicated many

703
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,869
was yeah I'll a me know so we're getting

704
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,670
to the ami asterix manager interface

705
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:19,460
this is what I like and what we're going

706
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:23,839
to do to connect one X Y it's connection

707
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:28,910
of a client to an asterisk to execute

708
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:31,190
commands or read events on a tcp/ip we

709
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:34,160
have our switchboard and based on the

710
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:38,869
permissions that we have you can see the

711
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,868
file configuration their manager comp we

712
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:45,500
have the user and the password one two

713
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:47,990
three four my favorite we can choose the

714
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:52,099
IP addresses that have permission those

715
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:55,310
that do not and we have to set this up

716
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:56,869
as a security measure we have to

717
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,350
determine the port at which the

718
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:00,180
communication will

719
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:04,350
and then we have reading and writing

720
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:07,560
permits as well we can see there are

721
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:11,880
many in all of there and this would

722
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:15,960
allow us to make telephone calls we can

723
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,050
also modify or change the visualization

724
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:24,810
of the plan we can look at the backlog

725
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:27,690
of all the calls we can collect the or

726
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:30,029
change the tone for the call when

727
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:33,890
somebody is calling and that's why I've

728
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:37,680
put it in red list of the DTMF and it's

729
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:39,509
just for reading it's not writing we're

730
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,549
not going to get the Asterix system

731
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:43,290
involved we're just going to read so

732
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:45,650
that when some DS puts in a number of

733
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:47,610
numbers we need to be able to see that

734
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:52,040
so the connection we're going to do it

735
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:55,560
this way how do we know we've done the

736
00:43:52,040 --> 00:44:01,310
Confederation correctly we do it a

737
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:01,310
telnet using the IP for the switchboard

738
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:09,950
we do tests we usually work with the

739
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:13,860
machinery configurating and the port

740
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:15,899
when you do the execution if the

741
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,350
response is correct to the reply would

742
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:22,260
be what you're seeing on there trying

743
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:26,970
trying to connect to the address and

744
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:28,530
then it says connected to and escape

745
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:35,910
character and a straight call manager

746
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:42,840
and so on here in the example is 5.0 so

747
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:51,509
the call of death let's do a test with

748
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:53,580
this concept let's make a call just be

749
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:54,900
fun oh we do that I had forgotten about

750
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:57,240
this slide so let's have a look at this

751
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:01,950
we need to know how to link it all

752
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:04,700
together so through the ami the

753
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:09,230
telephone let's see what it needs to do

754
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:15,450
so we've got a little script here and -

755
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:20,090
and we connect to the mi surface here

756
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:24,750
we're specifying the IP address the port

757
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:26,910
and the soccer connection the socket

758
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:31,680
connection that can be through python to

759
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:34,799
do the actual connection we use that

760
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,129
port to send the parameters in order to

761
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,570
connect these are very specific

762
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:43,650
parameters in order to connect with

763
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:48,360
these ami yes what you can see down

764
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:49,980
there the action two points username for

765
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:58,290
the for the person that we've called

766
00:45:49,980 --> 00:46:00,990
Arduino the intro username nothing intro

767
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:07,009
the secret with a key and then two

768
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:10,649
intros this is where we do the sending

769
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:12,810
switchboard receives the request and if

770
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:15,240
it's correct we connect and if it's not

771
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:17,580
correct it would return us or saying

772
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,279
that it's incorrect or that it's commits

773
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:25,560
engaged or any kind of other error

774
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:27,870
message and on the same script on the

775
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:31,410
top part we're connecting to the

776
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:34,770
switchboard with ami on the bottom we're

777
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:39,149
connecting to the Arduino with a series

778
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:43,590
more support as we have explained the

779
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:46,050
connection is very simple serial serial

780
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:47,580
and within the function we're going to

781
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:54,570
say to which port we're going to connect

782
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:57,480
and the speed in this particular case

783
00:46:54,570 --> 00:47:02,370
I've got the Arduino connected to the

784
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:06,930
device through USB and this is like in

785
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:10,730
Windows one or two all line exits call

786
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:13,859
this way so the TDR would be the

787
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:17,790
denomination of the port and the speed

788
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:20,160
and we can configure whatever we prefer

789
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,960
and we can configure the speed

790
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:28,080
in arduino we haven't changed it in this

791
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:31,590
case it's in 9600 so we leave it so we

792
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:36,960
have little waiting time and in initiate

793
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:39,420
a loop loop once we have the connection

794
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,480
with the ami and the connection through

795
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:45,830
the series with Arduino all we have to

796
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,830
do is to wait and see what happens

797
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:52,320
the only thing we have to do in the loop

798
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:57,090
based on what I received from the

799
00:47:52,320 --> 00:48:02,070
communication from the am i whether I do

800
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:04,170
a search because the a.m. I will send us

801
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:06,180
information all the time with everything

802
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,400
that's going on in the switch port and

803
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:13,230
ended in order to figure that

804
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:17,970
information out and I said we configured

805
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:22,710
it for the T TMS information all the

806
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:26,459
rest is of no interest to me if instead

807
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:29,880
of this you want to have a program that

808
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:32,760
manages calls in a company and see what

809
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:36,300
users are on the phone those that are

810
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,400
not engaged those are not there the

811
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,700
length of the call who they are talking

812
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:48,050
to you can actually do a panel with this

813
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:51,419
system am is very powerful and with

814
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:54,600
programming you can do of different

815
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:56,640
things the company I work for we have it

816
00:48:54,600 --> 00:49:01,140
configured in that way we have a panel

817
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,770
and we use it to manage all client calls

818
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:09,299
it's very very powerful because when a

819
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:11,400
client calls you have the call ie D and

820
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,650
it shows you all the information about

821
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,900
that client so that when you hang up

822
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:18,860
you've got everything that is ready you

823
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:22,040
don't have to wait until the user

824
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:24,410
see the ID and look for it access what

825
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,710
he or she has got or not gods

826
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:29,270
talk to them you have it directly and

827
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:33,740
you have all the background as soon as

828
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:35,810
you or in a hospital for example imagine

829
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:39,100
the programming there we can use

830
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:43,730
asterisk if the hospital has the

831
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:45,830
telephone numbers of all the users in

832
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:50,600
this particular sum think of a private

833
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:53,060
clinic as soon as somebody calls if the

834
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,580
number coincides with the list in the

835
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:56,900
switch on the switchboard then the

836
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:59,660
person receiving of the call would have

837
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:05,740
all the background of the cold with that

838
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:09,020
person so this reduces response times a

839
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:11,359
person has a given illness or issues

840
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:15,190
then I know how to continue if that

841
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:18,770
person has made an urgent emergency call

842
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:21,410
that's the difference between looking

843
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,940
for looking for the information that

844
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:24,980
clients if do I have to call the

845
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:27,320
ambulance or not but it's having the

846
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:31,790
information directly there in front of

847
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:38,210
you this is one of the good things about

848
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:40,690
automation I tend to go off a bit on a

849
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:43,850
tangent when I talk about these things

850
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:49,280
as you can see we have these automation

851
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:51,680
here we have the enumeration I'm in the

852
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:55,220
loop to wait to see the call and see

853
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,700
what number I have we have the response

854
00:50:55,220 --> 00:51:03,319
we have digit two dots one if it's

855
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:08,230
bigger than zero I will find that phrase

856
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:13,310
digit 1 I know somebody's selected one

857
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:15,080
it says turn the coffee machine so if I

858
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:17,150
select one when I make the call the

859
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,810
coffee machine will turn off you will

860
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:23,900
know if I receive a two it turns the

861
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:27,350
coffee machine we saw it in the Arduino

862
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:29,510
script beforehand on the relay

863
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:36,049
through the connection that we had on

864
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:41,270
our series if I receive a three you can

865
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:43,280
introduce execution commands shoots this

866
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:46,280
different script in Python you can put

867
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,950
in there or turn on a film you can put

868
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:54,020
in whatever you want he put in a direct

869
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:57,009
command there and then we could stop

870
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,009
making the call

871
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:03,170
we are they at last no matter that I

872
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:06,080
wanted so the call honor death nothing

873
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:08,200
for my D bar it's not gonna be what I

874
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:11,270
feel Nina I made an internal

875
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:15,200
configuration a simulation of the

876
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:20,030
switchboard and I have it set up I have

877
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:22,339
the telephone set up with number that we

878
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:25,850
know for people from the event so we've

879
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:27,320
used in thei base number so we have nine

880
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,940
eight seven eight seven seven one eight

881
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:33,140
nine that's them but I've been going to

882
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:39,200
call nobody's going to pick it with you

883
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:42,259
to hang up on me of course I don't know

884
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,580
if the microphone will reach so you can

885
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:48,140
hear the sound or not you will hear an

886
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:54,049
exchange saying that I'm here at

887
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:58,009
Cybercom press 1 press 2 for this press

888
00:52:54,050 --> 00:53:02,230
3 for this press 5 execute whatever

889
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:04,580
script seven or eight for Destruction

890
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:12,080
okay so we can configure whatever you

891
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:16,100
want so this is in a closed circuit that

892
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:19,400
has already been programmed and then

893
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:22,970
you'd say that's the number of exhibit

894
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:24,920
has just been used for M for

895
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:27,890
demonstration purposes and there's been

896
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,270
no damage during this process just to

897
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:34,549
let you know so let's go ahead and do

898
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:39,009
the call so we pick up the yomo yomo

899
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:39,010
phone and make the call

900
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:57,559
[Music]

901
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:59,119
rs.12 activate for three to execute a

902
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:02,599
script so you can hit a little bit of

903
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:05,059
what was coming on on the menu there it

904
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:09,410
turns on and it turns out if we select

905
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:13,029
the right number so let's go out from

906
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:13,029
here from under it go to another screen

907
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:20,630
so here I've prepared what I mentioned

908
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:24,109
before there are two connection screens

909
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:32,000
so you can see the execution visually on

910
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:36,500
the right we have the master this is in

911
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:40,849
real time and I swear some T's picked up

912
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:50,259
the ball there's a playback with the

913
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:54,069
recording recording an mp3 file in this

914
00:54:50,259 --> 00:54:56,750
particular case it's a different format

915
00:54:54,069 --> 00:55:01,009
it's not mp3 because I don't have it

916
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:03,049
installed on here it's you Lau so with

917
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:08,240
any Linux system you can do all these

918
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:11,480
configurations as well so after the

919
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:21,589
playback we can see the execution of the

920
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:26,210
message we have the connection and

921
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:38,690
receipt all the numbers finishes and

922
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:40,819
hangs up so if we go to the left the the

923
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:46,279
information that the switchboard is

924
00:55:40,819 --> 00:55:51,049
sending to us on the AMI and even though

925
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:53,039
we closed that on the configuration it

926
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:55,219
needs to be through the

927
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:59,309
DTMF but we do get a lot of information

928
00:55:55,219 --> 00:56:05,669
its specifies type of channel that is

929
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:08,269
being executed the call ID in this

930
00:56:05,669 --> 00:56:13,229
particular case it's an internal

931
00:56:08,269 --> 00:56:16,078
extension the context that was

932
00:56:13,229 --> 00:56:17,819
introduced the type of language it's in

933
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:23,219
English I haven't changed the language

934
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:28,140
to Spanish there's the number that we

935
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:31,829
could then we have some IDs through the

936
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:35,129
connection for the call and then we have

937
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:40,189
the digit which is what we are

938
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:40,189
interested in turn the lights on or off

939
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:48,749
to see that the LED lighted up so with

940
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,669
the other option we send them off with

941
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:52,499
option

942
00:56:50,669 --> 00:56:54,449
so now we'll see how the information

943
00:56:52,499 --> 00:57:02,578
goes through this shows you how the

944
00:56:54,449 --> 00:57:06,059
information goes through in mine that

945
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:09,390
rather than an LED display you could

946
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:13,380
connect whatever you want and I really

947
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:19,408
mean whatever you want it depends on how

948
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:25,400
you have programs this okay we're doing

949
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:31,999
okay with the battery for now although I

950
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:38,900
have not connected to the laptop to the

951
00:57:31,999 --> 00:57:42,390
power so let's get this prepared let's

952
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:46,619
repeat the call and have a look at both

953
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:50,279
screens on the right you'll see what you

954
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:52,709
get from the CLI and the left is the

955
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:54,150
script that we've done and it's

956
00:57:52,709 --> 00:57:58,109
receiving the commands or the

957
00:57:54,150 --> 00:58:01,579
information that we have prepared let us

958
00:57:58,109 --> 00:58:01,578
see how it goes

959
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:19,930
whisper example Adamas Aldo's so let's

960
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:24,069
select two for example we turn the LED

961
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:26,919
lights on and off a we select for we

962
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:30,430
executing and in math you can see that

963
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:35,410
on the screen and if we execute commands

964
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:38,910
six we activate self-destruction so

965
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:41,740
these are the different commands on the

966
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:45,370
right you can see everything they were

967
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:47,290
wanted to and the network that were you

968
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:53,740
think just imagine that we could have

969
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:55,750
compromised a system we could activate

970
00:58:53,740 --> 00:59:00,040
or self-destruction and it would

971
00:58:55,750 --> 00:59:02,230
distract the device and so people would

972
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:05,290
have nothing to analyze the analysis

973
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:07,420
would have nothing left to look at so it

974
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:09,730
depends on the options that you want to

975
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:22,930
give the device let's have a look at it

976
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:26,280
once again back to the beginning but

977
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:26,279
let's just go through quickly

978
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:39,010
consejos contra Melia okay so some

979
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:43,090
advice and countermeasures when

980
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:45,160
everything is possible we've seen that

981
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:46,720
was completely we can do whatever we

982
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,180
want because everyone there's a new

983
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:53,080
system someone will come and turn it

984
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:56,859
around and in a way it can be used what

985
00:59:53,080 --> 01:00:00,430
these things developers and makers of

986
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:02,380
these effect systems and devices know in

987
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,629
which all the ways people can use their

988
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:08,290
systems and hence apply security

989
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:14,520
measures to avoid that well now

990
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:18,660
monitoring and control both virtually

991
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:22,690
for us who work in computing is what

992
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:25,509
most normal deals the most so we monitor

993
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:29,290
communications we have wives firewalls

994
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:32,730
anti viruses repair the ports used on

995
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:38,710
the network so that for us is clear

996
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:40,330
controlling the port's that I am

997
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,430
managing it to work and I know that

998
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:45,700
there are certain protocols are not only

999
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:47,589
see but when analyzing network traffic

1000
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,359
I see those protocols being used and I

1001
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:52,090
would have to stop them you've got to

1002
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:55,600
them ring all alarms and see what's

1003
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:58,120
going on there are many different

1004
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:01,180
systems that do this but you have to

1005
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:04,540
remember this now monitoring traffic and

1006
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:07,870
blocking everything that's listing

1007
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:10,630
authorized machines Mac and IP addresses

1008
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:13,930
amongst others so we have to always have

1009
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:16,060
under control what is connected to the

1010
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:18,040
network and you have to monitor that and

1011
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:21,730
we shouldn't allow any unauthorized

1012
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:24,070
connections why knowing always mark IP

1013
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:26,590
addresses join with sivanna so that I

1014
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:27,360
always know which my devices and if I

1015
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:29,790
have an

1016
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:38,460
recognized device I can block it or just

1017
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:42,330
not allow it connecting the use of DHCP

1018
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:45,900
and loosing money pods disconnecting

1019
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:49,049
physically disconnected Ethernet switch

1020
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,400
hearts or breaches which Noreen use what

1021
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:53,370
happened to me said that they had a

1022
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,590
right it was accessible to everyone with

1023
01:01:53,370 --> 01:01:57,630
thousands of cables wherever anyone

1024
01:01:55,590 --> 01:02:01,530
could come and plug anything in but I

1025
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:06,390
wanted here and everywhere I have seen

1026
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:09,060
hundreds network connections I could

1027
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:11,400
connect any device I want to tune I

1028
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:15,890
could work with at the network both the

1029
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:21,180
building I don't know if it's being

1030
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:25,200
monitored here I would imagine so on the

1031
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:27,750
right we're all consumed treated those

1032
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:30,230
which shouldn't be in use or which

1033
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:34,500
aren't working and there should be

1034
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:37,080
disconnected and should only be

1035
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:40,560
connected when they are going to be used

1036
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:43,350
now if you have a socket when accessing

1037
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:46,590
the toilets for example I don't think

1038
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:48,180
that should be working but if I plug my

1039
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:50,340
computer on then I have access to the

1040
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:54,419
network well on the right that should be

1041
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:57,180
eight switched off now my actual access

1042
01:02:54,420 --> 01:03:00,210
to the racks the best way of protecting

1043
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:02,609
that it's physical protection not only

1044
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:06,780
where they are but also they should be

1045
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:09,000
in rooms with locking doors and not

1046
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:11,100
leave the keys just next to the door

1047
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,200
they it's um in some places they have a

1048
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:16,049
very well protected back then once you

1049
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,439
get to the rack you have the key that

1050
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:26,190
opens the door stuff next to the lock

1051
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:29,790
well that is not very wise creating

1052
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:33,470
isolated networks for guests or between

1053
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:35,670
departments now there's something that

1054
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:37,799
many places in the restaurants for

1055
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:38,370
example require a Wi-Fi network after

1056
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,530
all

1057
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:42,720
my Wi-Fi network and everyone can get

1058
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:46,920
connected to my Wi-Fi network and that's

1059
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:51,810
what I have all my devices which I use

1060
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:55,110
for getting payments from people I use

1061
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:57,270
those systems to take orders from tables

1062
01:03:55,110 --> 01:04:01,370
and I have all my clients getting

1063
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:06,210
connected freely to that network well

1064
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:09,029
mixing your work with hundreds of people

1065
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:11,070
who choose passed by can do I don't

1066
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:16,070
think it's logical or normal well that

1067
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:16,070
happens every day you can take the don't

1068
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:25,140
now the best thing in these cases you

1069
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:27,060
have separate network working network

1070
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:30,720
and then another network which is

1071
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:32,940
exclusive for guests and if you don't

1072
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:36,299
have the resources then at least create

1073
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:39,240
different IP ranges so that there's a

1074
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:42,330
little bit of separation now this is

1075
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:45,439
from home eight point of view you know

1076
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:49,290
professionally obviously we've got many

1077
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:53,040
now something which is very important is

1078
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:55,560
the budget we destined to cyber security

1079
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:59,250
is not expense it's a necessary

1080
01:04:55,560 --> 01:05:00,870
investment and what happens usually with

1081
01:04:59,250 --> 01:05:03,360
the budget that you have cyber security

1082
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:06,120
the you only remember that when you've

1083
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:08,130
already been victim of an attack but

1084
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:12,630
that's not how it should do because I

1085
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:15,120
remember do I only remember that I have

1086
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:16,770
to invest money in cyber security when

1087
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,380
I've already had to run somewhere no I

1088
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:21,090
have to invest beforehand in order to

1089
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,800
avoid getting that ransomware

1090
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:26,340
because you have to take into account

1091
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:29,040
that cyber security in the same way that

1092
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:33,240
we're implementing the best technology

1093
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:36,890
or spending as much as we can to avoid

1094
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:40,740
people coming into our company to

1095
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:43,350
burglar us we have blinds we have lamps

1096
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:47,319
to you you know to avoid our company

1097
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:50,080
being compromised but if we work on the

1098
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:52,150
and we closed all doors and lock all

1099
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,770
doors but item closed the internet

1100
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,330
window cleaners are going to come on

1101
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:58,180
through there they cannot use the door

1102
01:05:55,330 --> 01:06:00,400
they will use the Internet so what

1103
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:04,060
company nowadays does not have emails

1104
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:06,100
online shop websites you've got none if

1105
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,810
you protect your physical shop then you

1106
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:11,740
have to protect your online shop as well

1107
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:13,840
so the budget for cyber security should

1108
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:16,750
be compulsory that should be the best

1109
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:19,150
thing to take in same way well I see

1110
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:21,760
what I'm going to write above my door

1111
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:24,130
then I have to know how much I'm going

1112
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,560
to spend cyber security because I'm

1113
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:28,710
going to be attacked sooner or later I

1114
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:31,450
don't know when but it's going to happen

1115
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:34,920
could be today tomorrow or in 10 years

1116
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:34,919
time but it's going to happen

1117
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:42,460
phishing one of your employees who wants

1118
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:44,050
to sabotage your company because they're

1119
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:46,090
angry about something so there are many

1120
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:49,060
ways in which you can prevent this we

1121
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:51,220
have to be ready if you need to you just

1122
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,259
hire the best people and choose them

1123
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:56,020
have a hacker in your life and this is

1124
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:59,530
all thank you so so much for being here

1125
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:02,280
if you have any questions I will be

1126
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:02,280
happy to answer

1127
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:17,049
hello I just wanted to well first of all

1128
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:20,868
thank you very much for this workshop

1129
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:23,990
and I've seen that when you are typing

1130
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:27,740
you only get one number how about if you

1131
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:28,669
wanted to introduce an MS IP then you

1132
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:32,649
need to program it

1133
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:35,710
you will need loop yeah exactly

1134
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:38,180
yeah just take into account that

1135
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:40,280
programming and coding it's all about

1136
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:42,379
imagination there's no limits just

1137
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:45,500
turning it around on your head and see

1138
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:49,309
how you can code so how would I add an

1139
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:52,400
IP with this little device in the same

1140
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:54,530
way that I can change the IP connect

1141
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,660
through my computer like it's like a web

1142
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:58,640
interface that can change everything

1143
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,960
the user that is connecting and

1144
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,230
everything but why if I didn't have a

1145
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:06,200
computer if I have already set the

1146
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:08,630
device at home and I take it to a

1147
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:12,049
company and they have a different IP

1148
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:14,270
range and I cannot change VIP because

1149
01:08:12,049 --> 01:08:16,429
you cannot go and say let me the

1150
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:17,778
computer I'll change the IP no we're not

1151
01:08:16,429 --> 01:08:20,569
going to let you you just have to plug

1152
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:23,480
it in and have it work you've come here

1153
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:26,989
to set this up then just do it so you

1154
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:32,839
just take their device what did I says

1155
01:08:26,988 --> 01:08:35,988
you hash tag four times and you go on

1156
01:08:32,839 --> 01:08:39,019
your setup menu it's uh pretty middle

1157
01:08:35,988 --> 01:08:41,988
well I'm gonna go through whatever first

1158
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:43,520
of all it will know which IP it has

1159
01:08:41,988 --> 01:08:47,178
configured everything in English by the

1160
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:51,230
way and it tells you which IP address

1161
01:08:47,179 --> 01:08:54,500
you have and you have the option of

1162
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:56,599
changing it so you choose changed

1163
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,689
wireless and then it says this is your

1164
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:04,929
current IP address and what introducing

1165
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:07,698
new one and so you would use asterisk

1166
01:09:04,929 --> 01:09:14,480
which would be instead of dots with the

1167
01:09:07,698 --> 01:09:16,580
IP address and then the hash key and so

1168
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:18,229
I have changed the IP only with the

1169
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:20,450
phone

1170
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:22,519
the same way that you can do it like

1171
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:25,250
this you can do it on your asterisk

1172
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:27,020
switch boys just think how you want to

1173
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:28,819
do it there's no limits because it all

1174
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:35,720
depends on your imagination or how good

1175
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:43,219
you are coding thank you oh my what

1176
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:54,590
happened dumbass any more questions yes

1177
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:57,110

1178
01:09:54,590 --> 01:10:03,770
someone to be listening in into your

1179
01:09:57,110 --> 01:10:05,690

particular so I couldn't tell you in

1183
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:18,170
detail how it could work I know it could

1184
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:22,040
be done but I don't know I cannot

1185
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:24,200

1186
