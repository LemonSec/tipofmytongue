00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,549
the ideas that you could give us of

4
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,549
things that we haven't thought of before

5
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:46,139
by empathetic oh okay said yeah you owe

6
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:48,659
me another what is done basically what

7
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:59,099
you get in reality including for mafia

8
00:02:48,659 --> 00:03:01,709
money hey static what can be of any it

9
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,750
existed over a hundred years ago for the

10
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:08,549
first time as you can see the device was

11
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:11,790
there quite large and the capacity was a

12
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:15,750
little much more limited but it existed

13
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,298
for the first time in 1901 they would

14
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,979
introduce more information using images

15
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,829
in order to improve what you were

16
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,989
looking at in terms of visibility for

17
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,870
the information so it's used in many

18
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:33,269
different areas how was this evolved

19
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:35,579
over time obviously many years ago the

20
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:38,699
twice as much larger and they were used

21
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:51,090
in university for education and it

22
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:53,729
wasn't available in our homes in 80's

23
00:03:51,090 --> 00:04:07,280
things improved quite a lot in terms of

24
00:03:53,729 --> 00:04:07,280
the size of the devices require a large

25
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:15,660
very interesting

[Music]

27
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:45,550
augmented reality let's talk about this

28
00:05:43,610 --> 00:06:19,879
videos from 2015

29
00:05:45,550 --> 00:06:19,879

[Applause]

32
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:19,900
but between themselves and a lot of

33
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,580
companies realized that a lot of people

34
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,099
were using this and this was the case

35
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,758
that recently came up and we have a look

36
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:31,349
at this now because actually you can

37
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,349
collaborate now that's quite interesting

38
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,830
I'm sure you're familiar with minecraft

39
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,500
you can do whatever you want with this

40
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,690
video game the augmented reality is

41
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,030
absolutely wonderful and it's about

42
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:08,930
collaboration and you can use the same

43
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,460
to use it in the same scenario and you

44
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:15,229
can play without having to leave your

45
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:19,780
home you can do different tests and so

46
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,780
on this just came out quite recently

47
00:08:36,350 --> 00:10:22,410
creativity we're gonna concentrate on

48
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:24,840
the first of these applicants we study

49
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,449
the horse whisperer impact Yelp arrow

50
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:39,630
we've seen that's used in video games

51
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:41,510
and for social impact allow your men

52
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,910
take reality is giving you

53
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,459
as your parking of the lines you know

54
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:50,529
when you have to time you know and

55
00:10:46,459 --> 00:11:10,699
there's also a sound everything sound

56
00:10:50,529 --> 00:11:22,639
you're seeing a little bit more distance

57
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:25,479
between one another for example matches

58
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,480
when you're watching them on TV

59
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,519
advertising that was actually augmented

60
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,980
reality or if it was actually physically

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,420
a lot of money in place field and have

65
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,990
seen that maybe in each of the markets

66
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,180
that needs to be looked into

67
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,500
perhaps you don't know what you want to

68
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:57,790
work in in the future back you could

something new came up I don't know if

82
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:18,760
you've seen this video game face on

83
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,230
they say enables you to be able to touch

84
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:32,140
in the game so I don't know in reality

85
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:53,110
but Kim Tammy Nike also there are also

86
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,870
cases of use that are not only used for

87
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:59,120
companies but they can be used in

88
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:02,270
different campaigns they have been used

89
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,980
for example in the monster a typical

90
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:09,530
campaign to show the power of blood

to reach difficulties you can help

93
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:23,030
people to understand and to develop and

94
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:37,030
to improve their level venire muy bien

95
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:38,990
sûr impact okay so the augmented reality

96
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,120
insecurity that's what we're getting to

97

eat that is funny in though it's having

pokemons you play with a Pokemon that

100
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:52,190
gets said recorded there are some issues

101
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:56,080
that need to be developed and worked on

102
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,080
in the field of augmented reality

103
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:03,370

if you have them loaded

117
00:30:34,680 --> 00:31:55,560
to include these libraries with an

[Music]

120
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:06,770
to our application and on this even if

121
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,770
we

122
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:57,799
script and we're going to make that cube

123
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:00,470
you know what's fin elemental video

124
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:03,529
cameras in upon a Muslim camera camera

125
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:07,250
camera then it's not going to work

126
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:09,230
Memphis commissary check it an emotional

127
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:14,089
repository encoded as I was saying we

128
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:17,359
have the code on the travail body within

129
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:21,920
vamos the body will go you know to add

130
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:26,019
our theme vamos a tener Omar Khadr

131
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,019
then we will have a marker

132
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,389
[Music]

133
00:35:40,790 --> 00:37:14,700
is called a box and here is to create a

134
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:20,280
local server with Python so we use 5 and

135
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:26,569
less 7 we use HTTP 7 and we open it on

136
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:31,080
the 8080 port so we have this here and

137
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:33,000
if we go in here as you can see we see

138
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,660
our application this is our first

139
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,520
application in augmented reality but as

140
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,549
I was saying this right now this is just

141
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,650
a camera it's having it's looking for a

142
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,690
place to position those elements

143
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,180
right now I didn't know where it cannot

144
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:50,820
distinguish I have prepared here on my

145
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,299
phone a marker and as you can see when I

146
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,340
put it in front of the camera yeah

147
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,720
sometimes with the light it doesn't work

148
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:02,160
that well but no yeah it does work

149
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,810
regardless of the light you can see so

150
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,990
we have a marker here and what the

151
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:09,810
marker is telling our camera is decision

152
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:12,180
this cube on this point interest and

153
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:14,820
because we said on the animation that we

154
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:18,210
want the cube to be position in this way

155
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,950
and for it to keep turning but that's

156
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,740
that's what it's doing as you can see

157
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:25,470
with this in 3d object so if I turn my

158
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,390
object then the cube is going to turn

159
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,640
because it's not the same perspective so

160
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:31,770
this is the first transexuals test this

161
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,009
is without sales or anything so saying

162
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:36,990
without I said at all what we're going

163
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:38,550
to do in order to add those do you

164
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,109
remember that line I told you that all

165
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,240
we're not going to use yeah we're going

166
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:50,120
to add it now we go back to the

167
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:50,120
repository and we add the styles here

168
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:58,680
just so you can see how the appearance

169
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:08,820
of our application changes just with

170
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:16,859
this line and now my phone decides to

171
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:19,260
work tiny bit you can see it bit and

172
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:21,630
then within this application we will be

173
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:27,900
able to add additional content for

174
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:29,850
example the instructions you have the

175
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,450
hashtag there especially if those of you

176
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:35,610
who are watching us on streaming in case

177
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,470
you want to ask a lot of questions this

178
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:40,020
is very basic and the next steps are

179
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,609
going to be a bit more complicated so

180
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,070
you've got the hashtag here if you ask

181
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:46,440
any questions I will be looking at it so

182
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:48,990
that we can answer your questions very

183
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:54,720
quickly instead not see it it's hash

184
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:58,069
back Cybercom marry marina it's I become

185
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,069
19 Mary

186
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:08,110
we'll go slowly little by little in case

187
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,570
you don't want to follow us live we'll

188
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,310
explain it little by little if you'd

189
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,380
like to access this right now you can't

190
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:17,980
because it's on my computer so I just

191
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:20,470
want to explain how you can use services

192
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,510
that available to everybody you can do

193
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:25,689
this augmented reality online and

194
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:32,290
everybody can access this so we'll go

195
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:34,930
back to the PowerPoint we're using git

196
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:37,960
so we're going to put it on github you

197
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:43,089
have two options you can do a fork from

198
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:45,130
our repository you can do that you need

199
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:52,710
the code or you can set up your own

200
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:57,010
concept test add all the changes and

201
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:59,140
then would put that in the repository we

202
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:08,170
have this in github we have our code

203
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:12,040
there and we can synchronize this now

204
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:16,180
with the meta file we have the github

205
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:24,870
repository so let's create an account

206
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:28,690
here on this surface Netley five this

207
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:31,529
service allows us to use it get herb or

208
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,820
other similar repositories and

209
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:36,910
synchronize the repository with this

210
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:40,960
service and this lifts up our web page

211
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:43,319
automatically so if you would like to

212
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,040
create an account once you've done that

213
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:51,490
you just have to click on this button

214
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,980
here's our Marie morena account you

215
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:58,209
can't see it to see it too well but

216
00:41:53,980 --> 00:42:01,870
let's have a look a little bit closer so

217
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:09,310
we'll create a new site we could use

218
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:09,900
also a bit bucket I'm going to be asked

219
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:14,140
for

220
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:17,500
authentication and we've already

221
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:19,299
synchronized these reports trees so we

222
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,010
have to open this up in order to place

223
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,880
it here and open up into our count go

224
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:27,850
into our account and select the

225
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:32,440
repository that were interested in cyber

226
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:36,700
camp 2019 shi security and augmented

227
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:42,160
reality and here we sit we see our

228
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:46,439
repository here let's go inside and it's

229
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,440
just a question of following the steps

230
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:52,480
and now we've already set up our

231
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:55,680
repository let's change the name in case

232
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,680
you'd like to do some tests

233
00:43:09,609 --> 00:43:16,640
so now if you're going to marry marina

234
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:19,279
calm then you'll have the repository and

235
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:29,450
we can navigate until we get there let's

236
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:32,319
find out where it is so it'll be in

237
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,319
exercises

238
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:58,360
just like on the fiddle so it would be

239
00:43:45,870 --> 00:44:09,220
concept test zero and in our case we're

240
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:11,800
going to go here to this solution and as

241
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,640
you can see we've got this up here on

242
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,280
the Internet

243
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,000
we've had some permission to activate

244
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:23,440
the camera and now that's already been

245
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:28,900
set up so now if you go to Mary morena

246
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,330
nettle if I calm exercises and in the

247
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,580
first project solution then you'll come

248
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:41,110
into this webpage because it's a public

249
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:44,520
one you'll need this turnin code that

250
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:50,530
you can find on the Internet approach

251
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:56,380
zero code gyro code they are available

252
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:59,200
there if you want to do the tests this

253
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:01,630
would be our first project so very

254
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,740
quickly we've been able to create an

255
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:14,320
augmented reality application so just

256
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:16,299
with this cube turning around so this is

257
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,600
what I was talking about earlier on

258
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:22,210
about how to create this web page and

259
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,490
this is what you would be able to see

260
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:30,310
here we did test with a piece of paper

261
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:33,310
and a blue cube so the examples that we

262
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:37,150
have seen we can see through them that

263
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:40,299
they have focused very much on free time

264
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:42,990
and games and the examples that Miguel

265
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:46,510
was talking about also for car parking

266
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:49,299
but the proposal we've made with the

267
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:51,640
rest of this workshop is more about

268
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,720
trying to do something a little bit

269
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,040
different with this technology it's for

270
00:45:53,720 --> 00:46:00,759
visual and has a great impact but we

271
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:05,200
could use it perhaps for cybersecurity

272
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:09,290
take this technology to cybersecurity

273
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:12,319
we're going to the physical element and

274
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:13,730
take it to the people and use it in

275
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,849
cybersecurity make it a little bit

276
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:19,820
easier to use it was a bit of a crazy

277
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:22,190
idea but we've been able to do something

278
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,290
with it and that we've got a number of

279
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:27,880
examples in which augmented reality can

280
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:31,099
actually help us in terms of security

281
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,020
the first and its most simple one that

282
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:36,080
we thought of is something that we've

283
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:40,310
all seen in offices in schools in public

284
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:45,950
spaces we're talking about the Wi-Fi

285
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:47,990
code hello this is our Wi-Fi so we have

286
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:50,629
public Wi-Fi so there's no issue with

287
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:52,939
that but in an office for example this

288
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:53,570
could lead to a person a visitor an

289
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,760
outsider

290
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:59,780
going onto our network and making use of

291
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:03,230
it so how can we make that a little bit

292
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:05,119
more safe in terms of the past words

293
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:07,280
we've all got written down on post-it

294
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:11,180
notes and or just on a blackboard or so

295
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:14,630
on so what we're going to do is to use a

296
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:23,450
returning code and to use that turning

297
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:26,030
code with a QR with information we're

298
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:26,990
going to have a little bit of a break in

299
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:30,369
ER so that people who are still

300
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:35,330
programming can continue somebody's

301
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:40,790
asking about what SL we have used it's

302
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:43,430
the item from Mac and we used said cell

303
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:46,849
we added that on because they're easier

304
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:48,859
to use as you can see it's self

305
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:53,180
completed and it's got memory and it's

306
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:59,720
quite good to use no more questions

307
00:47:53,180 --> 00:48:04,129
don't so here you have the link again

308
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:07,370
for the repository so let's have a look

309
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:14,950
at this example of the codes

310
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:19,160
access codes let's have a look at the

311
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:20,600
simple example there are some things

312
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,279
that we would need to correct if we

313
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,640
actually need wanted to use this or put

314
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,520
it into use but it's just an example

315
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,410
we're going to use a marker just like in

316
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,950
the previous ample because it's valid

317
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:39,589
for both and it's going to have a small

318
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:44,210
QR with our access code so that QR

319
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:48,340
stores our code and any application that

320
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:52,640
can read QR codes can read that code so

321
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:55,340
we'd need to encrypt that code and to

322
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,480
make it only possible to decrypt that

323
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:01,460
from using our application in the

324
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:03,650
corporate world this would be using an

325
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:07,100
application that would have some special

326
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:11,960
access codes in order to decipher that

327
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:16,520
information using the app in the second

328
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:19,490
example we use encoding and we wanted to

329
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,120
be incremental we'll put in more and

330
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:27,620
more concepts such as images and

331
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:30,589
changing content another interesting

332
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:35,990
thing is that when we use an app for

333
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:38,000
this QR code we can change that key we

334
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:42,109
could give it some different credentials

335
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,290
for the Wi-Fi network for somebody who's

336
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:51,170
a guest compared with somebody who's an

337
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:53,840
employee so we take a look at the

338
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:57,170
structure of the code it's very similar

339
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,630
to the one we had before we have the

340
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:03,080
scripts a frame we will join in our own

341
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:06,830
Java scripts we'll have a camera and a

342
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:14,090
QR code and what we're going to draw and

343
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:16,340
this is what we're going to add on in

344
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:18,170
this case the top part will be exactly

345
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,890
the same what we're going to change is

346
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:22,400
this sec

347
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:28,279
line in the bottom part and we're going

348
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:33,440
to add our QR library this allows us to

349
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:36,980
read the QR this is a library that is

350
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:43,070
available in github I'm going to turn

351
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:44,600
the camera off for just a second there's

352
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:51,530
another question that has come up in the

353
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:55,009
meantime so that any recommendation for

354
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:58,700
the video consoler for executing i'm

355
00:50:55,010 --> 00:51:04,220
using a term but you could sublime or

356
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:06,620
any other I prefer these IEDs that less

357
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:10,640
close then it clips or some of the other

358
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:14,750
well-known ones there are and hold no

359
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:18,279
problems but getting github I don't

360
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:21,020
really know how it works in Windows I

361
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:23,960
think you can use it from the IDE

362
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,580
directly but if not you'd need an

363
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:32,570
external program but I can't tell you

364
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:36,470
much more about that so let's go to the

365
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:41,740
second concept test which is the Wi-Fi

366
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:41,740
one so let's go to the second exercise

367
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:48,259
we have our libraries with the

368
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:51,380
JavaScript in order to manage their QR

369
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:55,760
codes here I have the marker if you

370
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:59,780
would like to use that there will be a

371
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,880
number of pictures above all the top

372
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:05,660
part and all the aesthetic part that

373
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:09,110
used in this field so let's go to the

374
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:14,810
exercise open up the index which is what

375
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:16,670
we're interested in and the first as we

376
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:22,490
said we want to be able to read a QR

377
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:23,810
code so the market is not a QR let's

378
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:28,700
distinguish between one thing and

379
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:31,190
another we've got a marker here what we

380
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,109
have here what I'm showing with the

381
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:35,469
mouse

382
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:37,359
is the marker this is what recognizes

383
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:40,690
library to to put the position in the

384
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:43,200
augmented reality on the other side this

385
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:47,380
is a QR code that storing information

386
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,769
they're not the same thing but we could

387
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:57,249
use the QR code as a marker if we want

388
00:52:50,769 --> 00:53:00,609
you to so let's continue now so let's go

389
00:52:57,249 --> 00:53:03,328
to the index we're adding our library to

390
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:03,328
read QR

391
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:23,449
so as in the previous case we have the

392
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:25,640
code that we need let's go to the

393
00:53:23,449 --> 00:53:27,769
solution I forgot to add one little

394
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:34,009
piece on here just this little bit here

395
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:38,149
we'll take our script and we paste it

396
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:41,630
here saying we're going to use their

397
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:45,349
script in this location and it's in the

398
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:49,880
lip file and this file that you can see

399
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:55,880
down here so we have a library that can

400
00:53:49,880 --> 00:54:00,259
I read the QRS so we want to need to be

401
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:02,749
able to tell it how to use kilos so

402
00:54:00,259 --> 00:54:07,099
we've included that in this information

403
00:54:02,749 --> 00:54:10,749
here and that is going to use the camera

404
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:16,099
on our laptop and create a reading loop

405
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:20,928
to locate the QR codes if it finds one

406
00:54:16,099 --> 00:54:22,640
what it will do is it will send the

407
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:27,650
information to this library that we've

408
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:31,670
created that QR code and in this case

409
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:34,099
the information is a password and it

410
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:38,479
will show us on the screen and we'll see

411
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:41,380
that in a moment so let's execute this

412
00:54:38,479 --> 00:54:41,379
library first of all

413
00:54:51,690 --> 00:55:02,440
so now what we have in our project is

414
00:54:55,180 --> 00:55:05,049
what you can see here we have fin up

415
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:07,380
mented Realty application so the code is

416
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:11,830
very similar to the previous case and

417
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:14,290
we've added a library to interpret the

418
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:16,720
information the QR codes and a small

419
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:19,330
script that we've done to use that

420
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:22,450
library and send us the information from

421
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:29,529
that QR code so that we can use it and

422
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:31,240
show it to there to the user so we're

423
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:35,230
not going to use a cube in this

424
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:40,419
particular case now we're going to use

425
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:44,290
an image in this case we're going to

426
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:46,960
show the user a poster maybe on a wall

427
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:50,980
with the access code with the password

428
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:54,310
on it so on one of the sides we'll show

429
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:56,710
one of the elements that we have and

430
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:59,799
this allows us to show use the

431
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:07,780
application to show this multimedia

432
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:09,610
content which can be images or videos so

433
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:12,360
we have an example of these kind of

434
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:12,360
elements

435
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:26,619
what are the clearest element so when

436
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:31,270
we've been creating these elements what

437
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:34,420
we have is an asset we want we say that

438
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:37,030
we want it to be an image we've given

439
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:42,130
this ID to the image so that we can

440
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:45,100
locate it and it will be in this static

441
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:46,060
file and it will be called password

442
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:52,990
panel

443
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:56,529
PNG this is the Wi-Fi poster that we can

444
00:56:52,990 --> 00:57:01,750
show people using the application using

445
00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:04,869
this augmented reality this is the same

446
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:11,170
as before so we need a marker the

447
00:57:04,869 --> 00:57:14,170
highroad so rather than showing the cube

448
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:17,440
what we're going to say to our is that

449
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:20,430
it's an asset it's the image that we

450
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,430
created beforehand

451
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:32,890
okay but we take it from here and we

452
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:38,350
place it in this position this is an

453
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:40,150
element of the library we need to

454
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:42,339
indicate that it should show us with

455
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:45,940
this kind of rotation so that when we

456
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:47,710
focus on it with the mobile device or

457
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:53,400
similar so that it was up the right way

458
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:55,840
not back to front and we scale it 1 1

459
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,859
that is it will be the same size as the

460
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:03,940
marker and if you see here we have the

461
00:57:59,859 --> 00:58:10,869
source the source of the content we have

462
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:14,970
this ID here the asset so now if we

463
00:58:10,869 --> 00:58:14,970
execute this let's see what happens

464
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,040
so now we have our project when you go

465
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:46,509
into the same thing we did before we

466
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:52,810
execute this local server on our

467
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:57,940
computer let's go to our navigator and

468
00:58:52,810 --> 00:59:00,850
going to 8080 so we have a similar

469
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:04,890
presentation to beforehand if you have

470
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:04,890
any questions so use the hashtag please

471
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:14,140
and we're going to show this cold I'm

472
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:24,750
going to see if my mobile will work for

473
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:24,750
me no it doesn't want to work

474
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:44,210
let's just see what's going wrong here

475
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:51,260
we've got our asset here and we've got

476
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:53,450
our image and we probably got a script

477
00:59:51,260 --> 01:00:01,250
here that meets something else we need

478
00:59:53,450 --> 01:00:04,069
to add that name we need to show the the

479
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:06,500
password to our user if it's able to

480
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:09,380
decipher that QR code we need to be able

481
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,580
to show that so how do we do that

482
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:14,990
we're talking about augmented reality

483
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:17,660
how do we show a text so within this

484
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:28,629
library we've got the option of how to

485
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:31,850
do that so we need an entity here the I

486
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:35,120
D for this entity would be password the

487
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:37,700
same rotation as the image and we'll

488
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:40,040
position it with inside our image so

489
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:42,350
it's in the place that we want it to be

490
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,330
so they don't just have a text on one

491
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:47,630
side and on the other side of the room

492
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:50,299
we've got the marker so let's scale it

493
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:57,140
to make a little bit bigger than the

494
01:00:50,300 --> 01:01:01,670
size of the QR value it's password not

495
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:04,339
fast I'll show you the JavaScript in a

496
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:07,820
moment initially it will search for this

497
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:22,850
entity to add the content let's see if

498
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:26,270
it wants to do it now now it is show now

499
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:34,009
instead of showing the cubes what it is

500
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:35,630
going to do is show because we are using

501
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,780
it without computer the thing is the

502
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:40,170
moment we publish this on the

503
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:43,690
we're not going to use our computers

504
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:45,280
laptops can lab but our phones can just

505
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:47,860
you know for simplicity because it's

506
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:52,630
easier to do it for these demonstrations

507
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:55,150
we're doing it from laptop we've seen so

508
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:59,050
far is that we didn't have text yet if

509
01:01:55,150 --> 01:02:01,690
we show the QR now as you can see we

510
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:09,130
didn't see any bugs and now let's see

511
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:11,830
how the script works we go to the QR

512
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:13,810
reader which is the code that we did

513
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:17,890
ourselves to tell the key or library

514
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:20,500
what to do with this Cuba and what it is

515
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:24,009
going to do is find the password element

516
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:27,550
it'll add an attribute to it which is

517
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:31,300
text and give it a value which in this

518
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:37,180
case is the data that we have within our

519
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:47,620
QR code so we've already raised this

520
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:49,270
from nets lafha and now it's a bit

521
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:52,650
easier because all we have to do is

522
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,650
input this here

523
01:02:59,829 --> 01:03:08,569
we have another question it's not about

524
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:11,808
okay it's asking where them with which

525
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:14,420
MacBook you used to from programming and

526
01:03:11,809 --> 01:03:21,609
whether you can use it for graphic

527
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:21,609
design as well I'm using MacBook Pro I

528
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:30,730
use it with any Linux distributor I can

529
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:35,750
use Linux or I can use this MacBook it

530
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:36,950
does work form programming it works for

531
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:40,130
graphic design as well although I

532
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:44,750
usually complement it with a tablet now

533
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:51,619
we back to base as you can see we now

534
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:54,170
see the image and what I'm trying to do

535
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:56,270
is for it to read this small QR code

536
01:03:54,170 --> 01:04:05,410
which we have here behind but it doesn't

537
01:03:56,270 --> 01:04:08,779
really want to work let's see again

538
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:14,868
because we have obviously uploaded with

539
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:18,200
something that is not right it's the

540
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:19,819
demo effect as you know but this is this

541
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:23,839
is the kind of thing that happens in a

542
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:26,650
workshop isn't it and we can see the

543
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,650
camera here

544
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:46,319
well just in case because I always have

545
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:49,540
this just in case I have put some

546
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:51,880
something wrong during the effect so

547
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,960
have this lifted here because we can and

548
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:55,060
we're gonna have a different amount of

549
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,860
image see and I think because this is an

550
01:04:55,060 --> 01:05:00,570
older version so basically what it says

551
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:04,270
here is that password has not been found

552
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:08,830
as you can see it has read our QR codes

553
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:12,810
and we have our password which is my

554
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:12,810
password key in this case as you can see

555
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:18,210
just giving access to the camera now

556
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:21,549
[Music]

557
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:26,650
it's not detecting the password password

558
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:32,050
found and now when you come closer then

559
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:36,750
you do get our Wi-Fi password sometimes

560
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:36,750
light reflections in the screen prevent

561
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:45,430
so this is our second concept we have

562
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:49,029
seen with the assets here as we have

563
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:53,040
been as we have added them and you have

564
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:53,040
the examples you can see on the slide

565
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:18,190
cube adding red cubes we've got rid of

566
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:23,290
the cube and we have added a Wi-Fi panel

567
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:25,630
image and we have added a QR code to our

568
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:28,990
marker and we have given the possibility

569
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:31,750
of reading the QR information so in this

570
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:34,779
way whoever comes to our office will not

571
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:37,600
know the password so clearly and they

572
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:39,730
will have to use an application in order

573
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:41,950
to obtain that code so it won't be just

574
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:44,740
anyone who looks into our office from

575
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:47,290
the window this is just an example but

576
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:49,919
we think that it could actually be used

577
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:51,150
for many sorts of information

578
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,120
it's something that's very interesting

579
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:56,280
when it comes to protecting passwords or

580
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:59,279
the information of our physical

581
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:04,080
environment now if we go just another

582
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:06,060
step further we can think the biggest

583
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:08,460
good obviously be used for other things

584
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:13,110
how about using it for verifying

585
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:17,040
documents for example could we take this

586
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:20,570
digital world to reality so that we can

587
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:23,490
show use this more information about

588
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:25,140
these documents or certain documents

589
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:27,419
that they have printed on paper so with

590
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:29,730
a marker or with a QR code

591
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:31,680
we're going to print them together with

592
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:34,640
contracts or for example and an exam and

593
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:37,529
we're going to be able to verify that

594
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:40,470
that contract of that document has not

595
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:42,030
been modified for example or who that

596
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:46,230
document has been delivered to for

597
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:49,070
example and further than that we will be

598
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:52,890
able to see what level of sensitivity

599
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:55,110
the information contained in it has so

600
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:57,060
in order to do this without complicating

601
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:59,100
things a little bit more you have the

602
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:03,360
repository you know the hash tag and the

603
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:07,080
cyber camp marry marina if you have

604
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:10,430
questions and now we're going to test -

605
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:13,890
we will be able to see metadata with

606
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:18,359
this we will be able to trace those

607
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:21,090
documents and know who this document has

608
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:24,450
been delivered to whether this is

609
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:27,270
confidential and if it appears published

610
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:30,059
on the internet for example or on social

611
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:31,980
networks we'll be able to load case who

612
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:34,470
has filtered it where it comes from and

613
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:36,809
we will also be able to see whether this

614
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:39,780
document is confidential reserved or

615
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:41,340
whether it is public information and in

616
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:43,250
order to do this we aren't going to

617
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:48,270
start encrypting

618
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:52,529
information with for this QR code and it

619
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:52,920
will only be us who are able to decipher

620
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:54,479
it

621
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:57,170
so I'm going to show you the structure

622
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:00,719
again so you can see that even for bits

623
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:02,929
how a application doesn't really change

624
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:05,239
what changes is what's behind

625
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:07,790
the scenes but showing the information

626
01:09:05,238 --> 01:09:11,738
is exactly as easy as it was before so

627
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:16,509
in order to do it we're going to use the

628
01:09:11,738 --> 01:09:18,709
QR reading library and on top of that

629
01:09:16,509 --> 01:09:20,420
we're going to use this other library

630
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:24,049
that we're going to bring from a CDN

631
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:27,020
which is for cryptography so on the one

632
01:09:24,049 --> 01:09:30,080
hand we have to encrypt which we're

633
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:33,679
going to do through Python and then we

634
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:35,750
have to encrypt which we're going to do

635
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,690
through JavaScript and this is more

636
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:41,600
complicated because some libraries

637
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:44,178
thought Sulli use the same library to

638
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,730
encrypt and decipher but in one you

639
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:48,109
actually have to use different

640
01:09:45,729 --> 01:09:50,120
encryption or safe and different

641
01:09:48,109 --> 01:09:52,670
environments you have to know exactly

642
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:55,099
how it works and so it's going to be a

643
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:58,130
bit more difficult but I will show you

644
01:09:55,100 --> 01:10:00,260
later how we've done it so you see how

645
01:09:58,130 --> 01:10:02,719
it's done so we have a scene we have

646
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:07,060
camera a marker and then we have the

647
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:09,170
information that we wanted to show and

648
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:13,790
here we're going to add a little bit

649
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:16,760
more code in our body we have the scene

650
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:18,739
we're going to have different assets the

651
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:21,790
will model the three states our

652
01:10:18,739 --> 01:10:27,639
application will have which will be

653
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:32,210
valid document non not valid document or

654
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:35,800
no QR found for the information be

655
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:41,750
careful we're also going to use a hero

656
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:45,940
marker which is a combination in this

657
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:45,940
case of two markers

658
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:58,940
so we're going to combine this double

659
01:10:55,190 --> 01:11:01,700
marker because we are using a lot of

660
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:06,259
information because our QR has grown and

661
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:09,200
it's not so easy to put it in that hero

662
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:11,360
marker so we have to have it outside in

663
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:13,550
this library we cannot do it in all the

664
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,860
libraries you could actually use this QR

665
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:20,390
as a marker directly but because this is

666
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:22,429
the simpler one to use on web than we've

667
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:29,240
decided to find a balance between what

668
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:30,980
it offered us and what it didn't so we

669
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,990
have a marker as we were saying it won't

670
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:38,269
have a combined image and then we'll

671
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:41,420
have them camera now we're going to see

672
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:45,080
how this QR code is created we're going

673
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:48,920
to take a PDF document from our computer

674
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:56,420
and what we will do is we will take the

675
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:59,450
files binary the metadata and we're

676
01:11:56,420 --> 01:12:01,910
going to do an H map with this metadata

677
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:03,800
so the one we aren't sure that it cannot

678
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:07,940
be modified afterwards then we're going

679
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:10,310
to take a list of the metadata we're not

680
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:12,320
going to show it in this concept test

681
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:14,690
but you can you could do it you could

682
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:18,170
even include the title of document when

683
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:22,639
it's created or modified we're going to

684
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:24,740
have a level where is whether it is

685
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:28,610
private or public or extremely

686
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:32,929
confidential we're going to say who the

687
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:34,630
owner of the document file which in this

688
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:38,330
case will be the person it is delivered

689
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:42,010
and we're also going to use either the

690
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:47,900
whole document or URL to the digital

691
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:49,670
documents in a service or the two

692
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:54,950
documents against each other and make

693
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:57,140
sure the content has not changed so what

694
01:12:54,950 --> 01:13:00,269
we're going to do is on the one side at

695
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:04,190
creating the QR on a title script

696
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:08,660
and on the other hand we're going to

697
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:08,660
decipher the information on JavaScript

698
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:19,380
as I was saying we have the Q R on the

699
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:22,620
one hand and this other part which is

700
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:31,650
any browser where we decipher it this is

701
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:36,210
what it's going to look like so we go

702
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:38,009
back to the exercise and the first thing

703
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:41,100
that we're going to do is to add there's

704
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:44,700
new library but we have to import and

705
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:47,400
there's going to bring the crypto

706
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:50,510
functions so we go back to the exercise

707
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,509
number two

708
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:09,188
- - because we are importing this from

709
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:11,439
CD and we're going to internet but we

710
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:13,419
could always previously have downloaded

711
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:20,409
the library and then choose add it to

712
01:14:13,419 --> 01:14:22,539
our file queue are reading script is

713
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:25,030
where we've made the most changes and

714
01:14:22,539 --> 01:14:32,499
we're going to have a look at how we are

715
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:35,858
encrypting this and as you can see the

716
01:14:32,499 --> 01:14:39,010
code - the one we had before but as we

717
01:14:35,859 --> 01:14:42,459
get here with that same functions that

718
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:46,089
will allow us to work with the

719
01:14:42,459 --> 01:14:49,229
information for the queue this is where

720
01:14:46,089 --> 01:14:51,459
we're looking at the camera and reading

721
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:55,929
constantly the information it brings

722
01:14:51,459 --> 01:14:58,059
until we find our QR and the moment the

723
01:14:55,929 --> 01:15:01,149
QR is found than these function will

724
01:14:58,059 --> 01:15:06,609
stop then we'll also have the e

725
01:15:01,149 --> 01:15:10,499
ciphering function this is a concept so

726
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:13,179
we're not storing anything on the server

727
01:15:10,499 --> 01:15:15,309
or rather we're not storing it now that

728
01:15:13,179 --> 01:15:17,709
it shouldn't be done in this way

729
01:15:15,309 --> 01:15:20,729
we should do it in a safer way but

730
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:23,469
because we want this to be easier and

731
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:26,139
the purposes of this workshop we're

732
01:15:23,469 --> 01:15:32,369
going to do make this so we're going to

733
01:15:26,139 --> 01:15:34,749
name a library and then we're going to

734
01:15:32,369 --> 01:15:37,959
design that all the information that

735
01:15:34,749 --> 01:15:41,249
this QR library has students so we're

736
01:15:37,959 --> 01:15:44,169
going to take this library we know that

737
01:15:41,249 --> 01:15:48,909
we have a specific kind of cipher and

738
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:51,010
that it's in mode C B and so just

739
01:15:48,909 --> 01:15:53,379
finding the library through here

740
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:57,579
it will give us a string which will

741
01:15:53,379 --> 01:16:00,909
contain all the information now we're

742
01:15:57,579 --> 01:16:04,898
going to use this string here and what

743
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:07,209
we're going to do is when the QR code is

744
01:16:04,899 --> 01:16:10,359
read we're going to decipher it with

745
01:16:07,209 --> 01:16:11,469
this option which I have mentioned

746
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:14,469
briefly earlier

747
01:16:11,469 --> 01:16:16,809
and the state of it it has decrypted

748
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:19,210
we're going to ask to be image the only

749
01:16:16,809 --> 01:16:21,369
showing so at the beginning we're going

750
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:23,860
to have an image saying we do know the

751
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:26,558
state or a satan state unknown because

752
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:32,440
we cannot sign a QR but just if we

753
01:16:26,559 --> 01:16:36,210
eventually find the key and decrypt it

754
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:39,219
that means that the deciphering is

755
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:41,170
adequate so the person had the keys to

756
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:43,570
do it then it will show the information

757
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:46,030
contained in main key laughs so what

758
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:49,599
we're going to do is first see whether

759
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:52,659
this is valid or not then the owner and

760
01:16:49,599 --> 01:16:54,969
then the level of sensitivity and then

761
01:16:52,659 --> 01:16:57,610
if it's not valid then we will have a

762
01:16:54,969 --> 01:17:04,229
different image which tells the lots of

763
01:16:57,610 --> 01:17:08,889
the code is not valid and to be careful

764
01:17:04,229 --> 01:17:11,469
so this is more or less the code and

765
01:17:08,889 --> 01:17:13,829
this is what we've just imported so that

766
01:17:11,469 --> 01:17:16,929
we as we were saying import the

767
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:20,440
ciphering library to use it in a script

768
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:23,499
and then we've looked into what has

769
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:26,650
changed with respect to the India

770
01:17:23,499 --> 01:17:29,228
version so we go back to our scene to

771
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:30,848
our content so we're saying we don't

772
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:33,340
have choose one image now we'll have

773
01:17:30,849 --> 01:17:36,010
different images which model order space

774
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:40,530
around occasions so we're going to take

775
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:42,699
those assets and we're going to Allen

776
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:50,139
I'm going to show them to you now

777
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:53,110
they're on the statics we have this one

778
01:17:50,139 --> 01:17:54,760
that shows the document is correct and

779
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:58,960
we will have the owner on the left and

780
01:17:54,760 --> 01:18:02,380
the sensitivity level right we have this

781
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,780
one will basically say q1 isn't valid to

782
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:08,920
be careful and then would finally have

783
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:11,499
the unknown version and we directly just

784
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:13,119
write it on the image which is basically

785
01:18:11,499 --> 01:18:14,559
saying we have not been able to remove

786
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,598
the QR so we didn't even know

787
01:18:14,559 --> 01:18:21,369
sensitivity and have it in red because

788
01:18:16,599 --> 01:18:23,990
we're not able to verify it and this

789
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:27,630
will be the initial State

790
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:30,620
we've added our images here these are

791
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:34,350
the identifiers to be able to use them

792
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:38,190
afterwards and this is the path to the

793
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:40,500
static smile that work the app so now

794
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:43,410
we've done this we keep using our zero

795
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:49,620
marker I'm just going to add in this

796
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:57,540
case not only the image image the

797
01:18:49,620 --> 01:19:11,670
website but also our tests the owner and

798
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:16,980
the sensitivity level then just as we

799
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:20,760
did earlier we have an entity one is own

800
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:22,709
of the other one is encryption then we

801
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:25,850
have the camera position of the table

802
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:29,670
with respect to the markers we

803
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:31,800
differentiated before the scale ie the

804
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:33,870
slice it's going to have another respect

805
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:36,090
to the marker the value which initially

806
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:41,519
will be zero and then the color of the

807
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:48,210
text in this case and so we have the

808
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:51,860
first part and let's test it now I'm

809
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:51,860
going to close the other server

810
01:20:13,179 --> 01:20:21,139
and so let's go back to the exercise so

811
01:20:18,019 --> 01:20:21,889
we've got the contents here structure is

812
01:20:21,139 --> 01:20:25,429
what we're saying

813
01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:28,699
we've got the South library with statics

814
01:20:25,429 --> 01:20:37,909
the index we lift our local server with

815
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:44,898
- and let's see and as we were saying

816
01:20:37,909 --> 01:20:48,799
before you a QR code here together with

817
01:20:44,899 --> 01:20:53,300
the marker we're going to show it to the

818
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:55,669
camera as you can see it hasn't read the

819
01:20:53,300 --> 01:21:00,800
QR code yet because it's too far away

820
01:20:55,669 --> 01:21:03,739
from the camera and if we bring it

821
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,860
closer and my phone decides to work for

822
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:05,860
me

823
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,909
see if maybe I've forgotten to import

824
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,909
the library could be let me check

825
01:21:40,039 --> 01:21:47,759
now we have it now it's reading properly

826
01:21:43,309 --> 01:21:50,989
it's showing us the panel and it's not

827
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:54,420
showing the tax sometimes it doesn't

828
01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:56,909
it's reading it quickly now it's not

829
01:21:54,420 --> 01:22:01,440
showing the text right now that's what

830
01:21:56,909 --> 01:22:03,749
happened to us previously it's showing

831
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,509
that everything is correct it's taken

832
01:22:03,749 --> 01:22:07,469
information from their QR and it says

833
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:11,280
decrypted it

834
01:22:07,469 --> 01:22:13,710
it's decrypted this information and it's

835
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:19,759
changing the image and saying that it's

836
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:22,320
okay let's see why there's an error

837
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:34,800
these are the development elements of

838
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:36,650
the server this is the hash for the

839
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:40,139
content of this hashes for the mega data

840
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:43,949
and this is the owner in this case we've

841
01:22:40,139 --> 01:22:48,119
put lala and the sensitivity this is a

842
01:22:43,949 --> 01:22:50,339
public document and once we've got this

843
01:22:48,119 --> 01:22:56,999
information using the Java truth script

844
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:58,230
which is what we're showing here so

845
01:22:56,999 --> 01:23:04,159
let's take a look at it from the

846
01:22:58,230 --> 01:23:04,159
exercise and we have it here

847
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:37,659
let's show that and here you can see on

848
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:41,889
the one hand the owner and also the

849
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:45,150
level of sensitivity so let's see an

850
01:23:41,889 --> 01:23:49,600
occasion when it's unable to n encrypt

851
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:52,388
so we have have just a plain text it's

852
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:54,460
not able to decrypt that because there

853
01:23:52,389 --> 01:23:56,260
hasn't been encrypted it will say that

854
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:58,360
it is incorrect

855
01:23:56,260 --> 01:24:02,469
put that little bit closer so that I can

856
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:05,860
read properly so now you can see this QR

857
01:24:02,469 --> 01:24:07,840
is not valid it's not verifying the

858
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:11,880
information in the document so be

859
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:15,040
careful we're unable to decipher it so

860
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:19,869
somebody maybe has modified this QR code

861
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:31,050
or has not encrypted it using our our

862
01:24:19,869 --> 01:24:34,420
codes so this would be the third POC and

863
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:38,139
the case would be how we could print

864
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:42,190
this QR how do we take that digital

865
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:44,650
document insert it and then print it so

866
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:46,480
let me show you the Python script it's

867
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:49,049
not in the repository I'll put it in

868
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:49,049
later on

869
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:04,420
I think it was this one let me just have

870
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:04,420
a look it's just here

871
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:22,420
we have questions even though it's not

872
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:24,520
directly related to this people are

873
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:27,240
asking where your shirt is from it is

874
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:29,770
very nice I don't know where is from

875
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:32,769
people ask a lot of things about

876
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:35,110
computing but nobody asks how we are not

877
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:37,270
asking how we are it's the first day of

878
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:39,219
cyber camp we've got the hackathon later

879
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:40,860
on so we're just starting but thank you

880
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:48,070
for asking

881
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:53,110
it's nice to be remembered let me show

882
01:25:48,070 --> 01:26:02,230
you the Python code we're going to take

883
01:25:53,110 --> 01:26:06,190
a document and we're taking this

884
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:08,139
document and a certificate to encrypt

885
01:26:06,190 --> 01:26:13,629
something we needs the certificate or

886
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:16,270
document if not to generate it itself in

887
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:26,650
this particular case we're going to take

888
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:29,680
the metadata document and we're going to

889
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:41,259
open up that document that PDF read it's

890
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:43,170
mega data and encode it in base64 after

891
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:46,510
this we'll take the content from the

892
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:48,970
document and do the same thing do an H

893
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:59,760
mark take a certificate that's being

894
01:26:48,970 --> 01:27:03,300
generated and add the ownership add the

895
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,300
senseability level

896
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:15,690
we will take the information and cipher

897
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:15,690
it using this function which is encrypt

898
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:23,460
we're using a Python library here in

899
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:29,790
this cases AES and we're going to use

900
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:29,790
CFP from before which is a size of 128

901
01:27:30,930 --> 01:27:37,750
so we once we have this ciphered code

902
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:41,230
we're going to get a library and create

903
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:44,860
a QR code using that we create an image

904
01:27:41,230 --> 01:27:48,580
and they encrypted code we're going to

905
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:53,290
call it cipher Q R and I'll show you how

906
01:27:48,580 --> 01:27:55,500
we would do this so let's go to the

907
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:55,500
terminal

908
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:18,730
so it's the cyber camp workshop and here

909
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:18,730
we have it so in order to execute this

910
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:35,970
I'm going to show you the documents that

911
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:47,280
we have we have a PDF in order to create

912
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:50,910
this QR and we will say that this is the

913
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:54,090
document in this directory and we're

914
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:57,240
going to put it in verbose to show the

915
01:28:54,090 --> 01:29:06,210
information the owner instead of

916
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:11,460
la-la-la will be another one and the

917
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:16,920
password so these are steps we took

918
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:22,890
previously since we haven't given it as

919
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:26,130
a certificate it made its own and we

920
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:27,900
have the hashes that from taken from the

921
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:30,810
information and this is the mega dater

922
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:36,450
it's the PDF call for papers for

923
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:39,240
Cybercom author is in C Bay and all of

924
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:41,610
this information is being stored and we

925
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:47,700
will be able to show that in the app

926
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:50,780
that we have created it says that there

927
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:53,130
is an owner and the sensibility level

928
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:55,349
and it will give us the encrypted

929
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:59,310
information this is the encrypted text

930
01:29:55,350 --> 01:30:02,670
that we have included let me show you

931
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:08,760
the image which is just over here it's

932
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:12,440
this one we need that gyro code that we

933
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:16,050
mentioned before if we show this to our

934
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:28,440
rather than the lalala as the owner the

935
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:30,210
owner will be doing you the owner so

936
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:33,660
with this Python code we've done this

937
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:36,930
part of the computer and then afterwards

938
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:40,349
we'll use the mobile to decrypt this

939
01:30:36,930 --> 01:30:42,780
and give the user the information he or

940
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:45,030
she needs about that document and the

941
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:50,070
mega date and where that original data

942
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:52,889
that original document is so once we

943
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:55,710
finished this heart if you want to do

944
01:30:52,890 --> 01:31:01,040
these exercises they will all be

945
01:30:55,710 --> 01:31:10,740
available in this repository it Cybercom

946
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:13,410
2019 - security with a our workshop in

947
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:15,510
the details of each project to have the

948
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:17,670
information of the code you will also

949
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:19,830
have it in a PDF at the end so that you

950
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:21,390
have that been available and you have

951
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:23,760
the information of how we've done that

952
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:26,670
and of course if you have any questions

953
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:31,530
you can still use their hashtag cyber

954
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:36,020
campanario right now so let's conclude

955
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:38,820
and Miguel will talk about future ideas

956
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:41,280
because we have given some examples but

957
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:44,009
we believe that many more things can be

958
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:47,280
done with this augmented reality is not

959
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:48,810
only for use in video games we can use

960
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:51,599
it in other different fields as well

961
01:31:48,810 --> 01:31:57,750
such as in security so security as we've

962
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:59,760
been talking about up until now this

963
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:02,370
sensibility level of documents is very

964
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:05,880
interesting and this is increasing now

965
01:32:02,370 --> 01:32:07,980
and as we use the goggles in augmented

966
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:11,400
reality more and more we'll be able to

967
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:12,660
use that and use it with regards to

968
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:15,150
documents they have round on the

969
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:17,010
offerman around the office and whether

970
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:21,690
or not you can use them officially or

971
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:26,040
not we have the issue that Ella PSA

972
01:32:21,690 --> 01:32:28,469
usually you chose and we go to the

973
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:30,180
physical plane and use these markers and

974
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:32,810
whether or not these documents can be

975
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:35,510
used or not and it's not so clear

976
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:39,450
documents tend to have every high

977
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:41,520
confidentiality level but the rather a

978
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:43,700
uses that you can put - with this

979
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:47,130
hardware with lots - augmented reality

980
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:51,080
there's another example

981
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:51,080
and is the case of authentication

982
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:58,769
anything to do with automation and this

983
01:32:56,910 --> 01:33:01,710
is very interesting in the field of

984
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:04,680
augmented reality and without the need

985
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:07,830
to be physically in a given place these

986
01:33:04,680 --> 01:33:09,960
are options that we could to propose or

987
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:12,660
in the first case in terms of vandalism

988
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:16,370
how you could propose systems that are

989
01:33:12,660 --> 01:33:20,269
already set up so that you can protect

990
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:22,980
so that nothing can be put on top of

991
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:24,900
different materials we're unable to go

992
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:28,410
this far but it'll be very interesting

993
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:31,019
to see what solutions you might propose

994
01:33:28,410 --> 01:33:35,300
for this and we'll see that it will only

995
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:38,640
not only be used to in video games and

996
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:41,100
in physical level we'll stop using the

997
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:42,870
usual post-it notes and have other

998
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:48,330
different options through augmented

999
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:54,240
reality this is a very well known case

1000
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:57,269
of how far or mented reality can go what

1001
01:33:54,240 --> 01:34:00,660
about if augmented reality actually

1002
01:33:57,270 --> 01:34:03,890
reaches physical reality it's about how

1003
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:03,889
far we can go

1004
01:34:53,780 --> 01:35:01,650
here we can see that the case of privacy

1005
01:34:58,950 --> 01:35:11,910
somebody can see who you're talking with

1006
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:15,269
when you're making a call and so on then

1007
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:19,099
the issue of spam is also very clear one

1008
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:21,930
so in advertising comes to this point

1009
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:25,110
they'll have information on a route

1010
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:26,730
where you are and you'll just simply be

1011
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:29,480
receiving information on different

1012
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:29,480
products

1013
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:40,299
you may not believe it but Japan is not

1014
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:43,030
like this but obviously technology is

1015
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:46,620
very part of life there

1016
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:49,240
the screens are there but there aren't

1017
01:35:46,620 --> 01:36:22,240
tractor to walk along like that in

1018
01:35:49,240 --> 01:36:25,200
actual fact I think it's pretty clear

1019
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:28,780
and we can see that the problems are

1020
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:31,870
specifically in privacy if people can

1021
01:36:28,780 --> 01:36:34,480
see what you're doing and the

1022
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:38,220
suggestions that you will be receiving

1023
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:40,660
and depending on how you navigate you be

1024
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:45,130
received different information from what

1025
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:48,070
somebody else would be receiving so

1026
01:36:45,130 --> 01:36:53,680
where is this going towards what are the

1027
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:56,590
trends so it's regarding capturing you

1028
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:59,050
and you might be part of a video game

1029
01:36:56,590 --> 01:37:02,860
and it's not profiles that you have set

1030
01:36:59,050 --> 01:37:06,010
up in the area of tourism it's very

1031
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:09,870
interesting because you won't need to

1032
01:37:06,010 --> 01:37:14,790
imagine things how things were before

1033
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:19,000
you can directly follow different routes

1034
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:22,030
using these different guides this is

1035
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:23,530
quite an interesting field and I believe

1036
01:37:22,030 --> 01:37:28,179
that it's already being used in

1037
01:37:23,530 --> 01:37:32,380
Barcelona tourism and augmented reality

1038
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:34,060
is an interesting point in education

1039
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:38,950
we've saw we saw the examples about

1040
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:41,020
UNICEF previously taking technology to

1041
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:43,849
different places where it's difficult to

1042
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:49,550
use augmented reality can be used

1043
01:37:43,849 --> 01:37:52,400
in different schools or in medicine how

1044
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:53,869
we can see illnesses or pain which would

1045
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:58,219
be otherwise very difficult if we didn't

1046
01:37:53,869 --> 01:38:02,780
have this technology but it's still not

1047
01:37:58,219 --> 01:38:08,929
clear how it be used in security in

1048
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:12,079
order to make environment safe we've

1049
01:38:08,929 --> 01:38:13,489
tried to see how this might be used but

1050
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:16,759
I think you are very much in the early

1051
01:38:13,489 --> 01:38:19,040
stages now now if you have any questions

1052
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:35,380
we're here available to answer them for

1053
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:38,570
you thank you very much I don't have a

1054
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:41,179
question I've tried to follow everything

1055
01:38:38,570 --> 01:38:44,389
that you were doing from the start and

1056
01:38:41,179 --> 01:38:48,500
there was a point when it was really

1057
01:38:44,389 --> 01:38:51,380
really fast I know you understand it but

1058
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:54,139
some of us to follow it was a little bit

1059
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:57,650
difficult it was just to say that say

1060
01:38:54,139 --> 01:38:59,150
well done it was excellent but actually

1061
01:38:57,650 --> 01:39:02,750
you're going really really fast through

1062
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:09,559
the screens and I found it hard to keep

1063
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:12,139
up it's difficult in two hours to

1064
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:13,550
condense everything into such a short

1065
01:39:12,139 --> 01:39:18,320
time and that's we put everything in the

1066
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:23,360
repository it's just a little bit too

1067
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:26,630
quick for me but in any case it's

1068
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:30,909
excellent if you'd like to do this at

1069
01:39:26,630 --> 01:39:30,909
home you can go through the same process

1070
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,619
yeah it was moving along really really

1071
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:40,010
fast and the slides were moving along

1072
01:39:36,619 --> 01:39:45,339
and I found it hard to keep up it was

1073
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:45,340
very very interesting however I

1074
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:51,790
hopefully will choose something else

1075
01:39:48,619 --> 01:39:51,790
thank you very much

1076
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:10,240
voice which is much oh well thank you

1077
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:10,240
everybody thank you very much indeed

1078
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:18,680
