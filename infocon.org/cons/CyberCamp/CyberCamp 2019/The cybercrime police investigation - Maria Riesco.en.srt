00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,560
always count on me for these events I

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:28,740
have been an inspector in the cybercrime

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,820
department of national police force and

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:37,050
then now I am working at the cyber

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:41,670
attack group by the general information

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:45,269
police station but beside that thank you

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,870
very much for you who are here at 8 o

13
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,050
clock after a very long day and welcome

14
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:58,468
to those who are listening to us on

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:00,599
streaming I wanted to do you a game you

16
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,180
know then not to make this very boring

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,729
so I'm going to ask you to participate

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:14,939
please can you access Kahoot dot in dot

19
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:18,560
eat and enter that we have a technical

20
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:23,728
profile here but I'm going to check how

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,850
much you know about cybercrime about the

22
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,658
National Police for for us about how

23
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:34,589
they we work on those crimes okay there

24
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,210
is no one accessing Kahoot don't will

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,310
not worry I'm going to give you some

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,639
time to access it okay those are new

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,640
players

28
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:19,319
like everyone there will be a winner

29
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:22,769
let's see who pays the beers you can

30
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:26,869
also play play remotely from your house

31
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:26,870
for those who are a xenos on streaming

32
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:50,100
ok are you all in shall we start

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:53,400
ok let's start where is the police in

34
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,970
charge of the contention of a cybercrime

35
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,750
the research of a cybercrime the

36
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:14,720
research of a cyber incident or to

37
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:17,880
warranty service security we will see

38
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,780
it's the investigation of a cyber crime

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:25,019
that's the correct answer question

40
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,100
number 2 when a ransomware infects my

41
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,220
systems

42
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,840
I restore immediately the information

43
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,730
from my backup copies

44
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,390
I collect evidence of what happened and

45
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:49,768
then I restore information I pay or I

46
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:52,470
format I assume the losses so yes I

47
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:56,070
collect evidence and then I restore

48
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:58,430
information Christina Bertrand is it

49
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,280
mandatory to denounce

50
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:06,140
cyber attacked only if it is a public

51
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:09,049
crime it is optional it is mandatory if

52
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:20,978
it is not mandatory but it is mandatory

53
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:23,539
to report it okay this one is

54
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:26,860
complicated but it is important to have

55
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:31,940
everything clear when I report

56
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:34,250
information about this incident it is

57
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,190
enough to send them the commitment

58
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,680
indicators I send all the information I

59
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:43,280
can find in my systems I tell them what

60
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,440
happens and does enough or I give data

61
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,888
related to cyber crime with the

62
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:54,979
technical report good I think you have

63
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:59,030
understood this clearly is it a crime

64
00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:01,610
for somebody to access the network of my

65
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,479
house without any authorization of

66
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:08,419
course only if they can access a device

67
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,510
not if they don't have that intention or

68
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:21,770
only if they don't

69
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:24,889
Buller eight security breaches it was a

70
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:28,090
trap question let's see the answer it is

71
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:31,389
not the same an incident or a crime

72
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:35,359
denial of service attack is it a crime

73
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:38,229
yes if I realize it has happened yes if

74
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,930
my systems have been significantly

75
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:57,440
affected if it is distributed or they

76
00:05:41,930 --> 00:06:00,050
always it is not as easy right some

77
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,000
concepts are not correct if I discover a

78
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:06,210
vulnerability that allows me to access a

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,540
system are reported to the police I do

80
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,210
not report it because it is a crime I

81
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:25,710
tell a friend to report it or I tell a

82
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:31,049
police friend this was this one was

83
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:35,820
easier okay let's see the podium the

84
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:42,890
third one is a is our second is Giulio

85
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:44,300
shoes and the first one is CI as SD

86
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,719
congratulations

87
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:52,980
so let's dismantle or all those myths

88
00:06:48,720 --> 00:07:07,500
that we have on cyber crime and cyber

89
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:09,330
incidents so let's see certain concepts

90
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,590
I'm going to be fast and brief and

91
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:17,340
precise questions will be for later ok

92
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:20,429
so simply let's talk about cyberspace we

93
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:23,969
all know what cyberspace is right I just

94
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:28,580
wanted to say that NATO considers it as

95
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:33,950
a fifth dimension where battle can be

96
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:38,969
can occur we imagine something like this

97
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:42,450
but I think we are aware that it is more

98
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,820
it looks like more like this and it's in

99
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:49,200
two systems where we implement cyber

100
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,750
security we human beings I mean so we

101
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,940
have a cyber space and we have cyber

102
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,100
security which are all the security

103
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,530
measures that we implement in our

104
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:02,490
information system or communication

105
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:05,429
networks so far so good right but there

106
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:11,400
can be some incidents of any kind that

107
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:14,290
affect the integrity of my communication

108
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:21,760
networks or my information systems

109
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:26,490
when does the police come into play this

110
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,980
is what I want you to understand they

111
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,169
enter in the game when there is a

112
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,419
cybercrime we do not manage cyber

113
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:38,919
incidents and we do not investigate

114
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:41,679
cyber incidents unless they are a crime

115
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,020
so we will see in which cases they are

116
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,969
considered a crime and which cases they

117
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:52,569
are not that point would be faced in

118
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:54,760
cybercrime how is cybercrime classified

119
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,720
in order to understand it in a very easy

120
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,330
way

121
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,370
there can be two kind of crimes there

122
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:06,280
are some crimes called cyber

123
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:09,490
facilitators those crimes which have

124
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,699
always existed but thanks to the

125
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:18,160
internet they can be spread and they can

126
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:21,280
reach much more people much more people

127
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,810
and then we have the cyber dependent

128
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:29,230
crimes those crimes which do not exist

129
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:33,430
without the existence of internet or

130
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:41,230
other communication networks as for

131
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:43,870
cyber facilitator crimes have greater

132
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:48,010
scope and they are more easy to be

133
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:50,650
distributed like frauds and scams they

134
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:54,460
have always existed traditional crimes

135
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:57,610
that try to fool us try to check me into

136
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:01,150
sending a payment in favor of another

137
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:04,270
person also crimes against people all

138
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:07,900
they insert a in insults all the

139
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,300
harassment they have all always assisted

140
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,510
but through social media and through the

141
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,540
internet it is easier to distribute it

142
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:20,310
and it is more serious also child sexual

143
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:25,120
exploitation intellectual propriety and

144
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:27,800
so on and then we have cyber dependent

145
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,440
crimes from machine

146
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,469
machine if we eliminate machines they

147
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,410
wouldn't exist because they never

148
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,870
existed before the creation of Internet

149
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:43,670
and social media and what are they

150
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:47,480
called cyberattacks what are they

151
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:50,000
exactly they are attacked again against

152
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,120
confidentiality of my information

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,740
information system on networks

154
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,680
communication networks against the

155
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,750
integrity of my domain documentation

156
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,949
data systems or data or networks and

157
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,519
against the availability of my

158
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,269
information or of an instructor so

159
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:13,000
what's the ruction

160
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:16,279
of cyberattacks according to Europol

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,290
first of all ransomware I don't think it

162
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,899
is necessary for me to explain what a

163
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:26,240
ransomware is there are less amount of

164
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:30,200
ransomware but they are more targeted

165
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,980
and they have more consequences usually

166
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,420
they happen due to an economic reason

167
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:42,260
but now there are more sabotage

168
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:44,149
consequences it is used to eliminate to

169
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,640
delete all the information that I have

170
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:50,630
in my system instead of asking for a

171
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:53,180
ransom to be paid and and then emails

172
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:57,020
and vulnerabilities are the ways of

173
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:59,410
infection the second one in the ranking

174
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,449
is the data compromise they want

175
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,569
financial information personal data and

176
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:08,720
credentials in order to commit other

177
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:11,690
crimes or to have some profit because

178
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,480
every data can be sold on the Internet

179
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:17,020
what are the attack vectors which are

180
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,420
more common phishing data breaches and

181
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,620
malware and be careful with insiders

182
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,769
what's that

183
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,380
it is the typical employee of a company

184
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:29,959
who is going to leave and doesn't have a

185
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,329
good relationship with the boss the

186
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,859
third one in the ranking is the denial

187
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:35,859
service attacks

188
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,469
these attacks entail normally extortion

189
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,860
this means for example attacking a

190
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,320
company or for example is someone

191
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,550
attacking Indra on the election day and

192
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,130
there was a company in charge of

193
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:56,410
counting the votes in you can extort

194
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:59,230
Indra and say for example either you pay

195
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,180
1 million u.s. to me or I cannot give

196
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,570
you permit to proceed with the continent

197
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,189
voting's so there is a lot of things

198
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,890
like that related to attacks and also

199
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,690
ideological attacks are very frequent to

200
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,460
know that we're having the climate

201
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:16,870
summit we may have to face some

202
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,090
ideological attacks against I guess

203
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,860
against the system of course then we

204
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,500
have the defacement which means

205
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,330
attacking our webpage it is not as

206
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,860
important but it is very visually and it

207
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:32,860
may have some impact but the IT systems

208
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,420
are inert barely are barely affected and

209
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,950
then we have other things that are not

210
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,650
cyber attacks that are not SCI we're

211
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,510
dependent crimes as we've seen before

212
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,850
but which are very important - because

213
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,850
they affect many people in companies

214
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:48,700
this is fraud and extortion extortions

215
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,800
are basically addressed to companies and

216
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,190
in the incidence of these type of

217
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,670
attacks is increasing a lot so what what

218
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,200
can I do if I'm suffering an attack many

219
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,630
of you are working on cybersecurity

220
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,700
sector and you probably know what to do

221
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,040
but well first of all you have to try to

222
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,100
detect and contain the attack mitigate

223
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,000
the impact that this may have and

224
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,360
ensuring the business can continue

225
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,010
working without eliminating evidence and

226
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,020
this is something I will explain later

227
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,540
and also protecting the system will be

228
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,970
the last step so normally whenever we

229
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,849
have emergency in the street the police

230
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,850
goes there in order to solve that

231
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,400
emergency and but this doesn't happen

232
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,830
regarding cybersecurity that see Artie

233
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,660
deserts are the ones in charge of doing

234
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,210
that we are in charge of doing the

235
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,160
police the police investigation that

236
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,850
happens when the incident has been

237
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,189
controlled and mitigated our work

238
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,949
depends on the evidence that has been

239
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:50,049
collected by the forensic team

240
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:51,639
the technical team needs to do a

241
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:55,389
forensic analysis of the information

242
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,639
gathered and this is why you it's needed

243
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:00,639
for information to be gathered safe it's

244
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,249
also needed to safeguard a street chain

245
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,709
and to draft our technical report all

246
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:09,549
these information should be given to the

247
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:12,040
police so that police this means us we

248
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:16,089
are able to do an investigation in order

249
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:19,748
to to arrest the criminals and what does

250
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:22,989
it mean the custody chain we are between

251
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:26,290
the people the technician and the legal

252
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:27,790
authorities and this is the whole change

253
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,410
we are working with the technical team

254
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,299
that are managing the incidences and the

255
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:35,919
legal authorities that we are in charge

256
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:39,160
or prosecuting the criminals so in order

257
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:43,239
for all the evidence to be valid and not

258
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,189
to be consider as tampered and to get to

259
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:49,389
know the real flow of an electronical

260
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:51,459
evidence we would need for you to be

261
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:54,489
careful when gathering information

262
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:57,040
whenever in evidence and we need to know

263
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:59,049
who has extracted information at which

264
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,639
moment for example if I want to access

265
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:06,549
the logs of a web server and that has

266
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:08,319
suffered effacement for example I need

267
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:11,919
to know who is going to download the

268
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,929
logs from which specific server this is

269
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:15,730
helpful for us in order to get to know

270
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:18,970
the infrastructure that you are using

271
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:22,559
and the moment in which you've done that

272
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:26,619
time and they all these things must be

273
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:28,629
registered my in writing this is going

274
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,799
to be delivered to the police and the

275
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:31,959
police is going to work with these

276
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:32,949
evidence and with this information and

277
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:37,959
we're going to be able to obtain

278
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:41,229
evidence and to continue processing the

279
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,939
case and the judge also is going to be

280
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:47,289
able to know where all these evidence

281
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:49,299
comes from so if I have we have runs

282
00:16:47,289 --> 00:16:51,549
where we cannot delete all the

283
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,379
information and restore the backups no

284
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:55,929
this is not what we should do we have to

285
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:59,220
gather all the evidence that we can in

286
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:01,470
the right way right in all the steps

287
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,330
which evidence are being gathered by

288
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,920
home in which moment and all this

289
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,890
information is going to be given to the

290
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:13,560
police and well of course after force

291
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:16,560
you will be in charge of restoring the

292
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:18,480
whole system again should I notify an

293
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,990
incident I'm talking about incidents not

294
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,459
crimes cyber incidents whoops in fact

295
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:26,400
what's the difference between an D an

296
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:30,420
incident and a crime for example if

297
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,780
there is a service denial attack in my

298
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,240
system I detected I contain it and in

299
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,889
that state and my website for example is

300
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,630
still working

301
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:44,940
that's an incident you've solved you

302
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:47,280
solve it solved it in the right way so

303
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,920
that's fine but there was no cyber crime

304
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,040
we're going to see the differences later

305
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:57,930
into that but that's just an example so

306
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:00,690
if I'm if I find if I face an incident

307
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:03,840
do I have to report well we have the NIS

308
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,170
directive that was transposed in the

309
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,740
Spanish legislation through the real

310
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:13,170
decree law 12 2018 and also the national

311
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,600
guideline of notification and management

312
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,430
of cybersecurity a cyber incidents are

313
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,699
attracted by the National Service

314
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:23,610
Security Council what does these

315
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:28,980
guidelines say well it says that there

316
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:31,469
is rank in our classification of

317
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,800
incidents and depending on the impact or

318
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:38,250
the seriousness of the incident I should

319
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:42,020
have to report it or not it also depends

320
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,550
on the company I'm representing in

321
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:48,330
depending on that I will have to notify

322
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:51,570
some institutions or different

323
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,919
institutions most of you I am I guess

324
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:57,090
you are coming from the private sector

325
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,790
but if this is a the incident is

326
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:05,060
affecting the national defence of the

327
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:05,060
country you would have to report the

328
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,900
the respective institution also the Data

329
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,870
Protection Agency may get involved in

330
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,440
some of the incidents but why do you

331
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:21,110
have to know about this well if you

332
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:26,090
don't notify viewed and report these

333
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:32,030
incidents view may face some some finds

334
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:35,360
some punishment if do you report all

335
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:37,790
this informations to the C ERT desert

336
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,149
they are going to give us that

337
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:43,580
information but we would only act when

338
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:47,300
there is a cyber crime not a cyber

339
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:50,600
incident and what is a cyber crime well

340
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,399
the this differentiation depends on the

341
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,699
modus operandi and the result produced

342
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,740
in a system for example regarding cyber

343
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,650
attacks against confidentiality we have

344
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:06,500
a crime which is illegal access to an

345
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:09,290
information system documents etc and in

346
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:13,060
order for these to be a crime per se it

347
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:20,360
should involve accessing personal data

348
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:22,940
sensitive data or that the security

349
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:27,760
measures have been violated for example

350
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:30,680
if I have a Rooter in my place and my

351
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,160
name and password is admin admin and

352
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,050
someone gets in that's not a crime also

353
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,920
regarding integrity

354
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:42,710
we have crimes related to computing

355
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:46,490
damages this means deleting information

356
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:48,740
within a system and it is going to be

357
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,080
considered crime when the result is

358
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:59,360
serious if someone is accessing my

359
00:20:51,080 --> 00:21:02,000
system it would be a crime but if

360
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,429
someone asks for example that dot in a

361
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,530
document it wouldn't be an integrity

362
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,440
crime it would be another type of crime

363
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:12,740
and also regarding availability they are

364
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,409
right availability crimes

365
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,179
if they are too serious they would be

366
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,279
considered a crime if I'm being if my

367
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:21,799
website is being attacked but there is

368
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:26,149
no problem with it and it keeps on

369
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:28,158
working then there is no crime in the

370
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:30,080
end the judge is going to decide on what

371
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,950
series or not but we must take into

372
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,070
account that if the system stops working

373
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,509
and stops providing services which are

374
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,950
important for the company of course this

375
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:41,210
is going to be considered a crime and

376
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,809
will be treated as such

377
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,909
and of course this legislation is going

378
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:49,690
to be changing and evolving all the time

379
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:53,659
because all these crimes are very named

380
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:56,929
and well we've seen most common cyber

381
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:59,179
attacks in the case of ransomware if the

382
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:01,039
result is serious this consider a crime

383
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:04,759
because these paralyzes businesses

384
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,100
regarding compromised data if they are

385
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,320
vulnerable 18 security measures they are

386
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,789
considered crime if they are affecting

387
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,149
personality at their crime

388
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:15,700
as for the OS DDoS attacks if they are

389
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:18,649
serious they are considered crime

390
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,090
defacement if they have serious result

391
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:22,758
they are going to be considered trying

392
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:25,309
normally this attack is considered a

393
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:26,690
crime and fraud and extortion is always

394
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:29,629
going to because neither crime in a

395
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:33,980
serious crime because these money

396
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:35,959
transfers that sometimes are done if you

397
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,000
notify the police the police afterwards

398
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,340
we can sometimes the stop they transfer

399
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,690
an extortion is a very serious crime so

400
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,389
you have to do is to talk to the police

401
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,879
immediately if you are not sure about

402
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:51,199
something being a crime or not which is

403
00:22:49,879 --> 00:22:55,580
something normal because you are not

404
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:58,879
expert in law you can call this not in

405
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:01,519
this number this year 9 one National

406
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:03,168
Police number and also you can call

407
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:08,419
their assistance

408
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:13,130
line of the in female also we have some

409
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:15,289
citizen ship collaboration network which

410
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,510
is anonymous if I find out on their

411
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:20,690
ability this is what we seen before if

412
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:22,580
we find a vulnerability in a system what

413
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,350
we do we do it should we report it or

414
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,559
not am i creamy am ia criminal

415
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:31,610
am I not there is an anonymous way of

416
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:34,029
reporting these information because in

417
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,949
this case it's not going to be a crime

418
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:38,360
but because you don't you found a

419
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,269
vulnerability but you don't have anybody

420
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,729
intention but if you don't know what to

421
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,350
do you don't have to tell to a friend or

422
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,779
keep it to yourself

423
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:54,559
or anything like that you enter into the

424
00:23:47,779 --> 00:24:01,029
National Police website holy SIA dot es

425
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:03,830
/ Calabria dot PHP and here you have

426
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:08,600
collaboration the area in which you can

427
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:10,070
do anonymous communications if you want

428
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,289
you can also write down your email

429
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,240
address if you want a reply from the

430
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:17,450
police but well we are there for YouTube

431
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,590
and then what happens regarding

432
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:23,000
reporting if I am suffering a crime if

433
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,129
I'm the victim of a crime is it

434
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,580
compulsory for me to report is it worth

435
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,269
it

436
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:33,289
well all citizens are forced to report

437
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:36,710
public crimes what's public cybercrime

438
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:41,120
well we've seen two types illegally

439
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:43,639
accessing our systems and crimes that

440
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,779
imply damages to our documentation our

441
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:49,610
systems or the availability of service

442
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:53,980
illegal accessing personal data or

443
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:57,408
violating security measures or

444
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,320
semi-private crime this means that we

445
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:04,760
need the real the victim to report in

446
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:08,178
order to prosecute that criminal I mean

447
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:10,010
we are not not forced to report that but

448
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:12,310
if we find this type of crime we can

449
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:15,280
even call the victim and offer

450
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:19,560
the possibility of reporting and but if

451
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:23,740
it affects a lot of people if it affects

452
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:25,929
publicly everybody is forced to report

453
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:29,440
that crime the difference between public

454
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:34,420
and semi public is that if it's a semi

455
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:38,230
public crime we can act but we need also

456
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:40,270
there we the victim reported but of

457
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,680
course in reporting is always useful

458
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,300
because this is going to start an

459
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,940
investigation and this is the only way

460
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,680
of stopping attacks because sometimes we

461
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:51,180
are receiving attacks from outside Spain

462
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,200
that's true but we have mechanisms of

463
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:59,680
cooperations nationally and

464
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:01,690
internationally even if you contain an

465
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,130
attack and you can keep on working in

466
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,750
your business this is going to happen

467
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,450
again because the same people are going

468
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,610
to be programming these types of attacks

469
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:12,190
launching these types of attacks so

470
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,889
wherever they are in the world we can

471
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,620
try to reach them and it's the only way

472
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:22,780
we have in order to solve that the

473
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:25,389
problem we have to address the cause and

474
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:31,000
well if I want to report I have to go to

475
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:34,060
the police station and probably I will

476
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,150
have to talk to the technology experts

477
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:39,730
of the police force and I will give all

478
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,190
the information available the way I've

479
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:45,130
explained before the logs the technical

480
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:49,990
report etc I will we will have to

481
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:53,650
safeguard a custody channel and well we

482
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:58,960
have we can give all this information to

483
00:26:53,650 --> 00:27:02,800
the police in a USB DVD then we will

484
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:06,190
move to the police investigation what

485
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,250
police investigation well first of all

486
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:12,220
we check that there is a crime we make

487
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:15,220
sure that we gather as many as much

488
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,680
evidence as possible and we resort to

489
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:21,520
all type of resources digital and

490
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:25,260
physical sources of information this is

491
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,260
going to help us find

492
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,789
someone that has participated in the

493
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:33,389
crime this is going to be a take this is

494
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:36,989
called technical attribution but besides

495
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:41,309
doing technical investigation we also do

496
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:43,979
Polish police investigation and I said

497
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:49,139
investigation we are going to try to

498
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:49,889
prosecute that a criminal in every way

499
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:52,649
possible

500
00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:56,189
with after all these things we are going

501
00:27:52,649 --> 00:28:00,329
to be able to find the person who's

502
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:03,119
guilty and we and we will put this

503
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:06,690
person out and the disposition of the

504
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:08,819
legal authority for a judgement and well

505
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,129
and I'm going to explain some cases of

506
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:14,219
success because all of you are

507
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:16,079
technicians and you may think okay there

508
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:18,269
are many ways of becoming anonymous on

509
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:21,209
the internet it's not easy to find these

510
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:24,419
criminals and they can be wherever they

511
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:26,519
want in the world they may have be

512
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:29,609
affecting many victims in Europe in

513
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:33,919
Spain and I don't know in many countries

514
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:36,539
and the author may be based on Ukraine

515
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,519
is it possible to reach these criminals

516
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:43,529
yes it is possible sometimes it takes

517
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:45,419
years but we have success cases and I'm

518
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:48,239
going to share with you some of the

519
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:50,609
success cases of my colleagues they

520
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:52,049
solved for example the case of a virus

521
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:54,139
that was affecting the police this was

522
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:57,599
the first crime somewhere that affected

523
00:28:54,139 --> 00:29:01,258
so an institution at the global level in

524
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:05,119
2011 2012 this started to happen and we

525
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:08,909
were here peonies in this cyber crime

526
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:12,978
case and we were the second police force

527
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:16,379
in the world in intervening bitcoins

528
00:29:12,979 --> 00:29:22,429
after the DEA so in Spain we are

529
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:24,809
pioneers and the investigation was so

530
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:28,109
successful I didn't participate it

531
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:30,928
because I wasn't even a policewoman but

532
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:33,559
back then but the investigation was so

533
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:33,559
successful that

534
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:40,809
the criminals were imprisoned for six

535
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:47,470
years and we didn't even have to go to

536
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:51,340
the card last year the biggest cyber

537
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:58,539
theft was arrested in Alicante I'm sure

538
00:29:51,340 --> 00:30:01,600
that you've heard of carbonic and well

539
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:04,059
they were carbon active leaves of

540
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,689
carbonate were arrested in Alicante by

541
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:11,230
my colleagues of the cybercrime unit and

542
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:16,110
this organization managed to tamper

543
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:22,659
there and the ATMs of banks in order to

544
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:25,658
get money from these ATMs and well as

545
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:29,380
you know financial entities have very

546
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:31,929
advanced cyber security systems because

547
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:35,830
they are very much attacked but they

548
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:38,169
managed to be within the bank for months

549
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:40,539
analyzing the ways they operate in

550
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:49,030
achieving more and more permits until

551
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:52,450
they were able to modify they the income

552
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:56,860
the amount of money in accounts they

553
00:30:52,450 --> 00:31:01,570
attacked more than 100 banks in 40

554
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:04,030
different countries and thanks to police

555
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,720
investigations at international level we

556
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:09,039
could solve this case so I want you to

557
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,770
understand the idea that we managed to

558
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:16,419
get these criminals and that we can do a

559
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:18,908
lot for you and I want to for you to

560
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:20,620
have a clear idea of everything that

561
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:24,720
I've explained so I'm going to go back

562
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,719
to the test that we've done before

563
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:46,239
so what does the police force do

564
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:48,369
containing incidents no that's what the

565
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:52,960
cybersecurity technical teams are well

566
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:56,499
what the third do thus we managed cyber

567
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,749
crimes but the policy level we do not

568
00:31:56,499 --> 00:32:00,759
contain cyber incidents do we

569
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:05,349
investigate several incidents not all of

570
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:08,049
them we investigate cyber crimes we do

571
00:32:05,349 --> 00:32:10,718
the investigation of this cyber instance

572
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:12,309
when they are considered to be a crime

573
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:14,739
are we in charge of guarantee in

574
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:17,649
cybersecurity no this is what many of

575
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:19,059
you to experts in cybersecurity all of

576
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:22,109
you are guarantee in the cybersecurity

577
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:22,109
in your companies

578
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:36,658
quand on somebody when a ransomware is

579
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:40,889
infected my system should iris restore

580
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:43,529
the information this is what you usually

581
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:45,479
do because the boss starts getting

582
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:47,669
nervous and nobody knows how to do but

583
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,529
if you are doing so you are going to be

584
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:53,639
eliminating many evidence that will help

585
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:56,010
us prosecute the criminals should I

586
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:57,959
gather evidence and then resort restore

587
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:01,139
the systems yes that's the right answer

588
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,360
should I pay I know that to have the

589
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:05,070
system back no of course we never have

590
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,570
to do that it's true that there are

591
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:09,210
small companies that don't know how to

592
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:11,789
manage that and they have very important

593
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,919
information when they cannot use the

594
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:16,230
system and they don't have backups they

595
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,750
do that but we shouldn't do that because

596
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,809
that could be encouraging these type of

597
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:24,090
crimes should I firm at everything and

598
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:25,620
assume the losses well I think that for

599
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,750
me that's even better than paying but

600
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:32,668
well it depends on the information that

601
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:34,830
you are handling and your losses in this

602
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:38,669
case is it compulsory to report a cyber

603
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:40,590
attack just if we if it can if it is

604
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:42,779
considered as a public crime well this

605
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:45,689
is difficult sometimes for you to know

606
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:50,940
so if you are not sure please ask call

607
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:54,450
the serial 91 I mean if I'm if someone

608
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,880
access my computer and I don't think

609
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,429
that my information is so important

610
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,039
maybe I am NOT going to report it and

611
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:05,159
that's ok but if the attack is something

612
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:06,690
that has caused damage to a system or to

613
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:12,950
a service I should report it that's

614
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:12,950
compulsory let's see the next one

615
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:19,649
when I give information about an

616
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,520
evidence to the police

617
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:26,149
is it just ok with giving them their

618
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:30,270
indicators no it's not enough because

619
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:33,328
maybe I can get to know where these

620
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:35,668
criminal lives and maybe I can arrest

621
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:38,040
him but the judge is going to say but

622
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:40,060
why is this person that criminal what

623
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,089
are the evidence

624
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:45,339
everything needs to be registered should

625
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:47,560
I give all the information that I find

626
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:49,029
in my system no of course not should I

627
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,429
tell them everything that's happened and

628
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:54,399
that's enough no of course not I mean

629
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:55,659
that's what you can do the first step if

630
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,670
you don't know what to do and we are

631
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:59,980
going to help you in order to gather all

632
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,020
the information needed to there to

633
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,700
report but the right one is I should

634
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:07,509
bring all the information related to the

635
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:11,049
crime plus a technical report is it a

636
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,540
crime if someone is accessing the

637
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:19,000
network in my house without

638
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:28,540
authorization not many people have knew

639
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:42,730
that answer it is only a crime if if the

640
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:44,440
security measures have been violated and

641
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,210
what happens with an ILO of service

642
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:51,359
attacks they always consider a

643
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:56,290
cybercrime and regarding vulnerabilities

644
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:59,619
yes you have to report any type of

645
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:01,869
vulnerability study you may find and you

646
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:05,710
don't have to be afraid of that

647
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:08,319
eh well I think that I'm going to finish

648
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:10,210
now because I think it's quite late but

649
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:12,609
I want to say something before finishing

650
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:14,680
as tomorrow is like Friday I like for

651
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:17,259
you to take their newspaper because

652
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:20,348
we've published some advice in order to

653
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:23,770
avoid frauds and probably you are all

654
00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:27,880
Internet users and you are careful and

655
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:30,610
you know how to identify URLs that are

656
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,150
malicious you can identify websites that

657
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:35,830
are do not start by HTTP et cetera but

658
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,420
these are very specific advices that you

659
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,630
must take into account that you may send

660
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:43,060
to your families friends and people that

661
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:46,720
are do not know that much about

662
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:49,060
e-commerce so that they are careful

663
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,189
tomorrow so well thank you so much for

664
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,980
listening to my presentation I hope that

676
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,190
afternoon

677
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,420
sorry because I arrived a little bit

678
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:54,310
later your presentation I got a half

679
00:37:52,420 --> 00:38:00,250
love love to be here from the beginning

680
00:37:54,310 --> 00:38:03,370
but I would like you to tell me as a

681
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:06,580
representative of the police force some

682
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:08,980
I mean I think that legal national

683
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,420
legislation is running short regarding

684
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,620
the investigation of cyber crimes

685
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,120
because this is not this is not

686
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,859
something physical is something that is

687
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,370
moving from even one continent to

688
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:22,030
another in the very first way I've been

689
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:23,650
meeting other police forces and because

690
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,020
of my work and I think that this is

691
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:29,410
complex even to monitor at the European

692
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,970
level so I would like I would like to

693
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:34,029
know how you're working with that

694
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:36,100
because it is a very complicated issue

695
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:38,580
yes as you were saying this is something

696
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,779
which is changing all the time but our

697
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,549
legal systems is

698
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,650
of the most advanced of the world

699
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:47,560
regarding international cooperation on

700
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:51,100
cyber intelligence we have a legislation

701
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,990
that was updated in 2015 and taken into

702
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,630
account the speed of legislation this is

703
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:58,779
quite a new quite modern this

704
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,460
legislation our lowest to the different

705
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:05,980
things that many other countries can not

706
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:09,970
such as remote investigation do a remote

707
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:13,530
investigation through malware my hover

708
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:16,660
undercover policeman police forces

709
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:19,650
working in different systems so these

710
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:24,370
are pioneer

711
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:27,310
lost in that even countries of Latin

712
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:28,990
America are copying from us it is true

713
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,980
that the investigation is very complex

714
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:36,939
because of the I know need unanimity

715
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:40,350
measures that criminals can use but we

716
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,880
can reach many places I'm not going to

717
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,049
to explain exactly the measures that we

718
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,790
are using but we have a lot of

719
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,040
investigations resources that are

720
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:50,380
working even though the issue is complex

721
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,920
and boring and even though everything

722
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:57,120
needs to be written down in a paper

723
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:00,490
bureaucracy is also heavy for us and

724
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:02,890
even that we managed to do a lot of

725
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,779
things act to us to access a lot of

726
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,060
information maybe even criminals could

727
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:11,500
be shocked by the information that we

728
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:14,170
can access and the cyberspace does not

729
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,270
have borders and if I want to commit our

730
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,650
crime in Spain I'm not going to do it

731
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,360
from Spain I'm going to do it from a

732
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:26,080
different country and there are

733
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:28,210
so-called computing paradise that are

734
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:34,150
that have different legislations I do

735
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:37,600
not provide em data or that do not

736
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:40,840
cooperate with European authorities so

737
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:43,980
in the end cybercrime cyber criminal

738
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:46,930
cybercrime turns into a geopolitical

739
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,420
problem related to political economic

740
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:51,100
interests between different states

741
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,430
different parts of the world and this is

742
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,700
affecting

743
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:59,290
but even though surprisingly we can

744
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:02,470
reach many places and regarding child

745
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:07,720
child porn everyone is willing to help

746
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:12,250
and it is a week can very efficiently

747
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:16,730
prosecute this child pornography

748
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:19,760
criminals good afternoon

749
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:22,370
well my question is not related exactly

750
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,650
to cyber crimes or cyber attack it's

751
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:27,640
more related to education I am the

752
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,640
principal of a high

753
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:41,110
secondary institution and we are facing

754
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:44,690
problems regarding phishing extortion

755
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:49,400
with videos so could you please explain

756
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:52,880
to me how these crimes are classified

757
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:55,010
and what's the penal sanction the

758
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,160
criminal sanction for that because they

759
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,080
for example sometimes students say they

760
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,960
cannot bring me to court because I'm a

761
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,910
minor so I need to have information on

762
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,710
that because I want to explain my

763
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,129
students if you do that this is a crime

764
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:11,390
and besides having an educational

765
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,920
sanction you are going to have also a

766
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,170
legal sanction and you're going to face

767
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,520
these and these well in the first place

768
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:21,080
I would like to invite you to send an

769
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:23,660
email to participate wealthier dot yes

770
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,790
because we have people from the police

771
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,310
that visit schools and that tries to

772
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:32,360
raise awareness among young people among

773
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:36,710
the students so well cyber bullying is

774
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:39,260
harassment are common cyberattacks in

775
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:43,130
high schools and this this is a crime of

776
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:48,500
course we would have to see each case a

777
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:51,560
case by case because crime implies that

778
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:55,040
a crime implies that a student needs to

779
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:58,279
modify his or her life because he or she

780
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,170
feels a danger for example if someone

781
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,360
has to cross the street because hears he

782
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,500
doesn't want to find out an attacker

783
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,480
this is

784
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,990
this would imply that he's suffering

785
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:12,950
from a crime other type of crimes are

786
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:16,098
not as well classified it depends on the

787
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:20,618
judge but we would have to see case by

788
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:23,119
case or if there are other crimes

789
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:27,260
related for example when we're talking

790
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,570
about fishing or accessing profiles we

791
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:33,800
have to see that case by case but

792
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:36,020
regarding raising awareness please send

793
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,160
an email to participate at free theater

794
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:43,040
yes and but also if there is a crime you

795
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,330
can call zero nine one in order to talk

796
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,609
to the police and they will give you

797
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:58,369
advice on specific cases are there any

798
00:43:46,609 --> 00:44:02,240
more questions so when you are doing

799
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:07,609
that DDoS but the website is still

800
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:10,250
working this is not a crime right and if

801
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:12,770
you do a permanent DDoS to the police

802
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:15,770
website but the website steals work you

803
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:17,540
see the crime no it's not a crime so can

804
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:23,119
we do that right yes you can do it it's

805
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:25,640
not a crime and we have our police force

806
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,900
is very well trained in order to

807
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,900
mitigate these type of attacks

808
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:49,040
you've mentioned we have an innovative

809
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:53,320
legislation related to cybersecurity is

810
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,730
this legislation criminal legislation

811
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:59,839
what type of legislation are you

812
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:01,460
mentioning because in the in your

813
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,470
presentation there where you've

814
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,599
mentioned some specific legislations but

815
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:08,990
can you explain to me there specific

816
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:11,450
legislation well in the criminal in

817
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:13,359
criminal law we have a latest update

818
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,990
from 2015 in regarding criminal

819
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:18,590
investigation

820
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:20,089
she is that the limp recent mellow that

821
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:22,550
you've mentioned they update it's also

822
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:25,130
from 2015 also regarding the incident

823
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:29,450
notification we have the NIS directive

824
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:33,610
from 2016 and the transposition of that

825
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:37,000
law into our royal decree law from 2018

826
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:41,240
but this wouldn't be considered a crime

827
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:44,390
notification goal is beyond it's apart

828
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,740
from crimes and another one side we have

829
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:48,790
notifications on the other side we have

830
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:51,529
crimes and when we're talking about

831
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:54,080
crimes we have the classification of

832
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:58,720
crime from 2015 and the investigation

833
00:45:54,080 --> 00:46:04,270
tools from the imprisonment law of 2015

834
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:08,330
well thank you very much I was wondering

835
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:12,080
what a lawyer could do in these cases

836
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:15,830
because I like I've seen that the police

837
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:19,810
is quite efficient but I was wondering

838
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:25,180
what a lawyer could do in these cases

839
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:30,590
well I'm not going to give you any clue

840
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:34,730
it's for them to to find it out but well

841
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:37,460
in fact we the police is doing a great

842
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:41,060
job we are pioneers in many of these

843
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:43,070
situations and it's true that for

844
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:50,090
lawyers it is very difficult to argue

845
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:51,380
with us regarding these issues well

846
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,790
thank you very much I loved your

847
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:56,270
presentation and the way you've

848
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:59,450
presented these information two days ago

849
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:03,619
our friends of mine recommended me not

850
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:07,310
to use online banking because they say

851
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:09,380
that there are well there there may be a

852
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:13,009
lot of crimes through these banking app

853
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:15,680
so do we have to be especially careful I

854
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:18,230
mean there are crimes but wouldn't have

855
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,790
to stop using these apps because even

856
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:21,440
though we are talking all times about

857
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:25,190
crimes technology is giving out a lot of

858
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:28,369
advances and we have to feel sure using

859
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:31,729
them banking apps usually have doubles

860
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:33,650
verification you are sent an SMS

861
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:34,819
whenever you are purchasing on the

862
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,299
internet for example

863
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:40,308
so I mean check the advices that I've

864
00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:42,200
mentioned before we got in Black Friday

865
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:44,809
because they are useful in general

866
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,930
you simply payment cards is something

867
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:50,630
also an advice that I can give you in

868
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:52,910
order to purchase on the Internet but it

869
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,950
is true that there my there are

870
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:57,499
applications that are still information

871
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:59,149
from your language but there's nothing

872
00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:01,430
you can do there it's not that they are

873
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:03,259
cheating the user through a phishing of

874
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:05,839
a website in which you are introducing

875
00:48:03,259 --> 00:48:08,779
your credentials this is something more

876
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,759
specific that is affecting directly the

877
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:13,700
banking app and that's completely

878
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:17,569
transparent from the to the user this

879
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:19,249
may happen of course I mean people say

880
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:20,869
that there two type of people peoples

881
00:48:19,249 --> 00:48:23,868
that have been installing and people

882
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:25,849
that will be installing and it's true

883
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:28,940
these things happen but if we are

884
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:30,559
careful enough that's okay I mean I'm

885
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:35,410
working in this field and I'm very

886
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:39,799
careful but once I was missing some

887
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:45,469
money in my account I called there and

888
00:48:39,799 --> 00:48:47,930
in this and I didn't do that purchase so

889
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:49,670
it's not it doesn't just depend on us

890
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:52,519
and how we are navigating because I may

891
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:55,759
have introduced this my credit number in

892
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:58,729
the services of a company in which I

893
00:48:55,759 --> 00:49:01,479
used to buy and then they have suffered

894
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:04,489
at data gate and this information now is

895
00:49:01,479 --> 00:49:07,578
spreaded all over that are wait wait so

896
00:49:04,489 --> 00:49:09,950
well the UCM prepayment card is a good

897
00:49:07,579 --> 00:49:13,239
advice and then if I have access

898
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:15,589
credentials in order to access these

899
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:19,369
ecommerce I should change these

900
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:25,910
credentials from time to time maybe

901
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:30,979
every month every three months and when

902
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:33,950
the app asks to save data and should we

903
00:49:30,979 --> 00:49:36,859
keep should we do that or not no never

904
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:39,460
you never you don't ever have to save

905
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:43,060
passwords in the navigator you

906
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:46,120
used password management systems if you

907
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:48,400
enter into the in CV website there are

908
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,799
many free tools that you can use and

909
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:55,360
many of them are useful in order to

910
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,650
manage these passwords and so take a

911
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:03,670
look and because these may be

912
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:08,830
interesting well congratulations for

913
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:13,150
your presentation I guess there are some

914
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:19,299
as amazed and freelance workers that

915
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:22,540
have also been attacked but is there a

916
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:28,570
room to collaborate with the police

917
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:32,620
force in order to set up SMEs to act as

918
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:36,780
mediators I don't think that's necessary

919
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:39,609
because if small company has an incident

920
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:44,200
they're going to recur to in theory in

921
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:48,790
order to contain that incident we are

922
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:51,700
going to be conducted for the police

923
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:56,950
investigation anyone anyone can contact

924
00:50:51,700 --> 00:51:00,310
us on the phone number 0 91 there are

925
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:03,819
technology groups all over Spain so if

926
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:07,090
somebody has a doubt in a very small

927
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,890
town the central services of technology

928
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:11,590
groups are going to receive that

929
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:14,560
question even if they ask it from abroad

930
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:17,710
we are coordinated and we're going to

931
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:20,070
manage all those consultations so I

932
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:24,220
don't think it is necessary to have a

933
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:29,740
intermediary between small companies or

934
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:32,470
individuals and police force we're

935
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:36,689
trying to help everyone every citizen

936
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:39,370
every company big small medium-sized

937
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:42,010
freelance we are there in order to help

938
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:44,190
citizens so I don't see there is room

939
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:52,110
for a private company to act as

940
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:52,110
intermediary any other question

941
00:51:57,859 --> 00:52:06,250
I wanted to ask you about the hatred

942
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:08,990
crimes you know an equality

943
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:14,900
discrimination they are there are more

944
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:18,759
of more of them the way of reporting

945
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:22,819
these hate crimes through social media

946
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:27,589
is different from bullying for example

947
00:52:22,819 --> 00:52:31,040
from school harassment I'm going to show

948
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:33,558
you the presentation once again I don't

949
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:37,250
know it could be a hate crime regarding

950
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:40,010
sexuality regarding religion do you have

951
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:56,180
a group is specialized in this kind of

952
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:59,450
crime we have groups which are

953
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:03,618
specialized in these hate crimes because

954
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:05,720
it is gaining more relevance and there

955
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:07,940
are more and more and on social media

956
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:11,299
people think that they can say whatever

957
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:14,359
they want without any consequences if

958
00:53:11,299 --> 00:53:17,420
you are a victim it'll be better to

959
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:20,900
denounce however if you are a user of

960
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:24,650
social network and you see something

961
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:28,819
that could be considered as a crime here

962
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:32,420
in an anonymous way you can report it so

963
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:34,759
you access the website of the police

964
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:37,670
force and then you have citizens

965
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:40,819
participation here on the right part on

966
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:44,750
the corner and then in that tab you have

967
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:47,240
to access citizen collaboration then

968
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:52,040
here you have technology crimes but

969
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:54,618
there are also hate crimes so this is

970
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:58,220
going to be sent to the group which is

971
00:53:54,619 --> 00:54:01,470
specialized otherwise we are coordinated

972
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:12,000
in order to send thus

973
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:19,200
claims to the specialized group what

974
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:24,000
happens with local police forces well it

975
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:26,339
depends on the police where you claim I

976
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,070
don't know if it's the regional police

977
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:33,150
of Catalonia or from the basque country

978
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:36,870
or the local police of madrid it depends

979
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:40,850
if they if they can handle it they will

980
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:43,230
do it however on many occasions the

981
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:49,940
judicial system is the one who is going

982
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:55,650
to manage it yeah and there is also

983
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:58,140
Department of cyber crime and cyber hate

984
00:54:55,650 --> 00:55:10,440
crimes and we work hand in hand thank

985
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:12,500
