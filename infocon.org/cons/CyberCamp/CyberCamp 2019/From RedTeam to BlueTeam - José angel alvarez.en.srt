00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,900
morning to all of you that are here in

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,240
Valencia and to all of you that are

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,029
watching through the streaming and well

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,729
hello to everyone that may watch this

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,250
video at some point first of all I would

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:32,278
like to thank in CV for the opportunity

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:35,180
of the opportunity that they gave me you

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,110
know that he gave a presentation here at

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,480
2018 cyber camp

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,340
well my presentation is called from red

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,440
to blue I've been thinking about this

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,129
presentation for a long time you will

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,680
see why later and the truth is that

16
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,789
wonder when I read that cyber cam was

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,239
given the opportunity to give

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,399
inspirational talks I thought okay it's

19
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:05,759
the time for me to do so so this is why

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:09,530
I'm here so I'm going to tell you a

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:15,479
story once upon a time there was a child

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:20,040
that had many dreams he used to dream

23
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:22,700
about going to space being an astronaut

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,630
an astronaut becoming an astronaut

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:30,240
traveling on spaceships drawn from one

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,339
planet to another he was not very good

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,079
at drawing a drawing as you could see

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:40,009
but when he was a little bit oh there it

29
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,149
seems that he liked everything that was

30
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:48,390
far away from the earth

31
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:52,290
he liked planes a lot back then I don't

32
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:55,700
know if he even watched Top Gun and he

33
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,909
he really liked this type of stuff and

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:03,810
he really loved superheroes too that was

35
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:06,140
his passion beyond the space and

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,580
airplanes he really loved superheroes

37
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,450
and of course whenever we have

38
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,610
superheroes we have also villains too

39
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,679
probably these are

40
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,720
modern villains the ones that you may

41
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,440
know but well superheroes and villains

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:27,750
were something that he loved he loved

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:31,050
movies and few years and everything in

44
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:34,530
the end how can you how can you

45
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,730
recognize a superhero in the street for

46
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,560
example if you see someone helping

47
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,350
somebody how can you know that that

48
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,080
person is a superhero I think that the

49
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,970
characteristic of a superhero are they

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:54,480
following super here is someone that has

51
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:57,510
super power super powers super here is

52
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,560
someone that is against evil because if

53
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,570
you have super powers but you are doing

54
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,810
things then you're a super villain or a

55
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,269
villain also spur here is someone that

56
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,940
is willing to defend the citizens you

57
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,370
are fighting against evil not just

58
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,350
because you want to end up with the evil

59
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,740
in the world this is because you want to

60
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,680
help all the people that that are

61
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:26,280
suffering from an injustice and also

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,410
super hero needs to wear a cool outfit

63
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,680
you cannot be wearing normal clothes

64
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:38,700
things you were will be wearing a cap

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:45,709
and a cool outfit so this kid this child

66
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:50,160
started growing up and he also loved

67
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:54,540
building and but also these monthly

68
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:57,060
things he loved building based stuff but

69
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:04,290
at the same time till children loved

70
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:07,980
also dismantling and destroying stuff he

71
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:14,180
started growing up well as you can see

72
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:20,719
time went by and these all these ideas

73
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:25,130
we're still there as he was growing up

74
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,130
he started making friends

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:32,599
these friends started to gather together

76
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:35,300
to do something really cool because some

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,020
of these friends had this type of

78
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:43,790
computer it was not really a computer it

79
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:48,710
was like console I don't know if any of

80
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:53,240
you got to know this this is the

81
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:56,150
spectrum which was like something out of

82
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,490
space for us at the time you could play

83
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,130
too many things in a screen everything

84
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:07,400
was moving it was way more fun that

85
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:09,590
train in a book so this child asked his

86
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,370
father who may be watching this through

87
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:17,960
his streaming asked his father to buy a

88
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:23,330
spectrum his father was very wise and he

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:28,780
told him ok I accept I'm going to accept

90
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:32,120
and his parents bought that child this

91
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,580
it seemed cool at the beginning but the

92
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,760
child was kind of shocked shocked I mean

93
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,370
it seemed kind of similar about this is

94
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:45,170
not unexpected right I mean I don't know

95
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:49,280
other games here but his father had a

96
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:54,770
plan for him he was thinking that

97
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:59,840
besides playing games this could offer

98
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:05,000
something else he decided to buy a

99
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,609
computer but in exchange this child this

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,080
child had to go to some classes to learn

101
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,440
some things and the child was completely

102
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,690
in shock

103
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,460
I mean his friends didn't have to do

104
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:21,080
these things they just had the expectrum

105
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:24,430
and could spend hours playing I have to

106
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:27,440
go to a class in which someone is

107
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:31,280
explaining to me things that are very

108
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,210
weird he sees in what's in English very

109
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,520
weird concept it was quite strange but

110
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:43,530
this child started to enjoy

111
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:48,900
this world and he realized that he could

112
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:51,929
play with some disks that he had with

113
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:56,219
some games but the child could also

114
00:06:51,930 --> 00:07:00,090
create programs so that the computer did

115
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:04,590
things and this was something that my

116
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:06,719
friends didn't care about but it's true

117
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:12,119
that something was changing inside that

118
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:16,259
child so time when I went by and when

119
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:23,280
this child turned 18 and when he had to

120
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:26,430
decide what studied University started

121
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:32,008
wondering what should I study there was

122
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:36,539
a degree in computing science which

123
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:39,530
sounded quite good I mean hmm young man

124
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:44,370
didn't know that maybe this career

125
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:46,739
implied studying calculus or algebra but

126
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,039
anyway he decided to study that that

127
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,860
degree he went to university study

128
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,960
computer science he learned many years

129
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:00,090
for things he learned some other things

130
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,370
that were not useful he learned a lot

131
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:08,789
about programming something that he

132
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:11,190
loved he learned languages and he got to

133
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:14,639
learn a lot during his experience at the

134
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:17,610
University this young man lived in the

135
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,779
north of Spain in Econ and when he

136
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:27,419
finished his studies he was he was 27

137
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:30,120
and he decided that he needed to look

138
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:35,669
for new horizons that he needed today

139
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:38,880
something outside house and therefore he

140
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,399
decided to move to Madrid I mean that's

141
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,588
the decision may seem quite weird

142
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,350
because if you see these two pictures

143
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,270
maybe it doesn't make sense for you

144
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,889
either because this one is a very nice

145
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:55,489
city which you can see etc but we don't

146
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:57,859
but young men decided to bring some

147
00:08:55,489 --> 00:09:04,389
change to his life and decided to move

148
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:08,149
to Madrid and well he started sending

149
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:10,459
resumes and Stevie and CBS and he got an

150
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:15,649
interview in a company called

151
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:18,290
in toss by MTA I mean these young men

152
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:22,879
had sent so many series that he didn't

153
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:34,009
even know who was contacting him and

154
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:36,889
this was a Space Agency DNA it was the

155
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:40,399
National Institute of aerospace and

156
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:44,059
techniques which is in Madrid it has

157
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,359
several campuses in Spain and he found

158
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:49,069
out that in this company they did these

159
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:52,879
type of deals that you can see on the

160
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:54,858
screen on the right you can see the

161
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:58,399
intercept which is the first satellite

162
00:09:54,859 --> 00:10:01,779
that was built in Spain that was put

163
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:06,350
into space in 1974

164
00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:08,720
so quite amazing all these things had

165
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:13,069
been created in Spain with Spanish

166
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:18,489
engineers Spanish budget so it seems

167
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:18,488
very appealing right up left you can see

168
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,730
also here you can see they you European

169
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:37,269
invoke heads and in one of the centers

170
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:42,499
that was stated to these little instant

171
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:45,980
mechanisms on systems that are now in

172
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:50,689
their curiosity in more in Mars are

173
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:53,389
being and where beautiful maybe it seems

174
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:57,949
that Mars is not that's shocking but for

175
00:10:53,389 --> 00:11:01,089
me it is amazing we don't talk that much

176
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:03,399
about how powerful we are as

177
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,860
country and that we don't do not that

178
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:10,569
much about the achievement of our

179
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:15,160
scientists and well we also have a

180
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:18,309
thorough we some of these devices have

181
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,379
been working in devices right now in

182
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:25,120
Mars so well everything seems really

183
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:27,579
cool suddenly the company said well this

184
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:33,910
is this job is related to information

185
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:37,540
security well I didn't know what to say

186
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,459
when Tommy must tell me more about it I

187
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,860
said look at all of his toys hockey was

188
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:47,739
trivial well probably you all know that

189
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:51,129
and these these young men needed to

190
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,249
start learning about assets things that

191
00:11:51,129 --> 00:12:05,769
you want to protect countermeasures

192
00:11:53,249 --> 00:12:08,889
attackers defenders are offered job like

193
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:11,790
that maybe you you may think that you're

194
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:21,249
going to defend something I said or I

195
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:23,498
don't know some things from us we've

196
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:28,899
seen during this event and as you

197
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:32,889
probably already know can you know if

198
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:34,660
your defense is working if you install a

199
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:38,050
firewall or a bar maid or something like

200
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,639
that how are you going to know that this

201
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,660
is working how can you go to bed saying

202
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:47,889
okay everything is fine I'm I'm not

203
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:54,309
concerned know that to do so you need to

204
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:57,249
try things first every day we can see

205
00:12:54,309 --> 00:13:05,860
that for example a company says that

206
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:09,879
these products impenetrable that I don't

207
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,930
know pneumatic coating an encryption has

208
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,119
been launched with

209
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,479
which is impossible to break all these

210
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:18,519
things are just words if you want to see

211
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,339
if something works or not you have to

212
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:26,079
test these for example you can have a

213
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:28,089
pen testing but if sometimes if the pen

214
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,779
testing is done by the bad guys and in

215
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,689
the end they are copying your

216
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:33,759
information you are going to be

217
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:36,819
concerned so in the end you need someone

218
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:43,059
a third party which is loyal and which

219
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:47,189
tries and tests your defenses in a legal

220
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:47,189
way or neither in that trustworthy way

221
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:54,490
and I must say that I really like the

222
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,350
Yulin and Alex presentation because they

223
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,350
explain very well what a hacker is

224
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:05,499
hacker needs to defenses so what a

225
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:10,240
hacker doing in cybersecurity well as

226
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:13,660
have a security hacker may try to find

227
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,759
out security problems so a company that

228
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,089
needs to defend itself only someone to

229
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:23,620
test the security measures and a hacker

230
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:24,639
it may be able to do that and Alex is

231
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,970
playing this very well later I'm

232
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:34,059
mentioning this not just about finding

233
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:36,910
vulnerabilities or security problems is

234
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:40,980
also important because you may find

235
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:51,089
security problems and then sell them

236
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:55,059
forget about everything else you need to

237
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:59,740
find out security problems and notify

238
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:01,269
them in a responsible way you know

239
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:07,089
they're not to end up in prison I think

240
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:09,119
I support them so important so before

241
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:11,889
and it's very important for everything

242
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:16,379
in their job in your life in your life

243
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:19,179
in their family so this young man was

244
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,980
thinking ok so I am being hired in order

245
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:21,500
to defend some things there are two

246
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,330
scenario

247
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,060
and we know that already there are

248
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:30,260
people in charge of protecting

249
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:35,890
Treasuries and there's people that are

250
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:38,920
high in order to test if their defenses

251
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:45,230
and in order to test that defenses and

252
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:49,699
explain what happens why we have these

253
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:51,860
two teams right teams said that the

254
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:57,350
collar rate of their teams comes from

255
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:59,600
the cold word but we may find different

256
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,080
explanations because these colors are

257
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,770
also used in the military area but

258
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:09,980
anybody can understand what this means

259
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:13,340
so what should the blue team that

260
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,140
offending team when talking about

261
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,560
cybersecurity well this team is in

262
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:21,470
charge of establishing defenses doing

263
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,530
perimeter protection protecting

264
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:29,110
information

265
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:32,600
francy analysis that we've seen before

266
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:36,710
all these tasks are done by the blue

267
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:42,820
team the defending team that is going to

268
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:42,820
test that defense being hired or not

269
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:50,230
team and they are in charge of hacking

270
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,780
we may think every type of hacking is

271
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,880
ethical but no it's not like that not

272
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,220
all hacking is happy at the ethical

273
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,619
hacking also district team is in charge

274
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,400
of exploiting vulnerabilities to in

275
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:13,969
penetration test analysis so there are

276
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:17,600
things that are encrypted and you

277
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:20,569
realize that the encryption is is

278
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:23,599
something starting with a meter social

279
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:31,310
engineering is also one of the tasks of

280
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:35,209
the red team physical hacking physical

281
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:38,659
barriers so we have blue and red

282
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,850
teams here elaborate interfere Molly so

283
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:52,730
what's the mission of a rebel Ibero

284
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:57,469
whole team hacker well we said that this

285
00:17:52,730 --> 00:18:01,190
is a person that's trying to test the

286
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,750
mission of the red team should be I'm

287
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,290
here I'm spending some hours here

288
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,990
working right shown that I can be a

289
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:14,810
dummy an admin of your company of your

290
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:22,850
system view this an option people think

291
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:25,280
that this is like blue team if the

292
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:28,610
result is fight free and that team has

293
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,590
won well that's great for that team I

294
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:32,449
mean it's always interesting to win but

295
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:36,290
I think that's something and there is

296
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,660
something else behind this in my opinion

297
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,690
the objective of a red team when you

298
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,430
hire someone in order to test your

299
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:47,450
system what you're doing is in train

300
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:51,650
training your defenders and you know

301
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:54,020
they're for them to become better some

302
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:57,110
test you find out some vulnerabilities

303
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:00,290
and you our report and then you pass

304
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,300
another ability then we will find out

305
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:07,879
new vulnerabilities in the future they

306
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:10,250
organization and really that may be

307
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,250
addressing the company is going to be

308
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,290
improving continuously so we need to

309
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,460
understand that hackers in this case are

310
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:21,590
there in order to improve their defense

311
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:24,500
defensive capabilities their

312
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:30,620
organization and sometimes they will win

313
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:32,720
the match but sometimes they want let's

314
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,409
go back to the story of that young man

315
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,750
was not that young anymore

316
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:40,340
he started working in the inside is not

317
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,030
what we was thinking about our first

318
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,980
he's in charge of computing security

319
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,760
information security he learns about

320
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:51,060
these two worlds

321
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,680
peel Red Team Blue team he's offered

322
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,580
these two peels and he decided to take

323
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,500
the red pill he doesn't know really why

324
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,689
because these are big companies spending

325
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,050
a lot of money on defense and you need

326
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,700
to prove that you're smarter than them

327
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:08,129
well in the end he disagrees he decides

328
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,040
to take the red pill I don't know if

329
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:14,250
you've watched the matrix because you're

330
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,710
very young I may consider changing my

331
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:20,700
jokes depending on the audience but well

332
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:23,880
the incredible thing about that is that

333
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:29,370
well in other companies may hire you

334
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:32,700
know the to do to be a hacker in surfers

335
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:38,989
in websites but this was something else

336
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:45,110
the context here for this young man was

337
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:47,730
finding vulnerabilities in the network

338
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:51,510
control network of the Euro fighter

339
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:56,370
plane what these seems pretty cool right

340
00:20:51,510 --> 00:21:00,570
I mean the I was I wasn't flying I was

341
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:02,370
not able to control airplane but I was

342
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:07,500
close to this world and I was

343
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:12,600
contributing to the sector these young

344
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:15,180
men learned here everything he needed to

345
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:23,280
know about networks about Windows

346
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:30,060
servers Microsoft about if they were

347
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:35,820
superseded patches or not very enriching

348
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:38,340
experience for these young men after all

349
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,159
the penetration of testing pen testing

350
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,830
that he needed to do in order to show if

351
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:48,020
a system was say secured or not many

352
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:52,860
more things arrived later this is the

353
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:55,800
a400m which is a military plane a

354
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,010
European military plane and in this case

355
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,280
it's not just that he had to try to

356
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,100
violate the

357
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,160
control system other systems connected

358
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:10,810
systems were participating too and this

359
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:14,890
was even more interesting because you

360
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:17,320
could be inside the plane I mean in the

361
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,850
previous case you knew that you were

362
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,030
working for the Eurofighter but you were

363
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,070
working from my computer here you could

364
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:29,530
start manipulating things in a plane and

365
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:42,010
you know the to verify networks we're

366
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:44,399
truly segmented or not for example this

367
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:47,379
young man doing in this company he

368
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,410
started working with encryption meter

369
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:55,000
encryption mode machines such as the one

370
00:22:50,410 --> 00:23:00,390
that you can see on the screen on the

371
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,940
right you can see encryption machines

372
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:11,740
then we will see later where these

373
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:16,000
machines weren't used CP IP also became

374
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:18,940
something very familiar to him he was

375
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,100
spent many hours at night studying

376
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,710
because he didn't have enough plenty

377
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,230
during the day to understand all all of

378
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,570
these things he started discovering new

379
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,760
tools new scripts that people published

380
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,070
on the Internet you know there to find

381
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:42,040
vulnerabilities of these in these

382
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:44,560
equipments on the right you can see well

383
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,070
here you can see so much means that are

384
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,840
similar to computers that are used in

385
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:55,030
different sector such as the mainstream

386
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,860
sectors - and and they have Borden in

387
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:59,200
the in which you can click in order to

388
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:03,389
delete all information inside so in this

389
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,560
case the client needed to know the

390
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:10,810
defense system of these equipment with

391
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:13,899
really working I mean they wanted to

392
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:17,080
know that for example when the soldiers

393
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:20,440
in Iraq if they click that button in an

394
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,409
emergency situation they wanted to make

395
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,490
sure if if maps and all the documents

396
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:30,430
inside we're going to be deleted and

397
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:37,660
using the skills of our team you are

398
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:41,280
able to get to know that and also again

399
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:43,690
in that company in the in top they were

400
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:51,879
assessing the security of the

401
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:55,330
electronical ID it has been it's not

402
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:59,230
been as widely used as we like to but it

403
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:01,928
is a basic identification document here

404
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:04,320
in Spain so this young man also

405
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:07,450
participated in all of the tests

406
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,460
analysis studies in order to look for

407
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:17,980
vulnerabilities in the electronic ID

408
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:21,040
which i think is a huge achievement in

409
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:24,340
spite of the size of the key and the

410
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,129
problems with the code that we had now

411
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:36,428
we know that it is a secured ID document

412
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:39,220
and it can in this case of course this

413
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:41,830
young man had to start deciding again

414
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:44,860
about smart cards about how these things

415
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,360
were I mean does it have a computer

416
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,820
inside how is it working does it have

417
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,520
buttons this was a new challenge for

418
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:56,399
that young man and he had study allowed

419
00:25:51,520 --> 00:26:00,639
and also the Ministry of Defense they

420
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:05,080
had some similar IDs that needed to be

421
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:08,350
secured another concept that I want to

422
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,870
mention is the unbalance between a track

423
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:14,800
our defense I mean if you're our

424
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:16,928
defender sometimes you may think the

425
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,540
defender needs to do everything right

426
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:22,510
all the time in order to do a right job

427
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:25,120
and nobody is thanking them for that

428
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,350
however the attacker just needs to find

429
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,010
as small failure

430
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:35,060
in a moment of time and he obtains all

431
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:37,190
the glory so to speak this approach is

432
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,820
not useful because otherwise if you're a

433
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:42,620
defender you are going to quit your job

434
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,169
well I just going to mention these and I

435
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,540
will go back to this later to see if we

436
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:50,030
can change it a little bit because if

437
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,770
you have this approach pressure is going

438
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:53,750
to be huge and you know that you are

439
00:26:51,770 --> 00:27:00,500
going to do to make a mistake at some

440
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:02,570
point the offensive side is a good

441
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,270
opportunity to start working in the

442
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,210
cyber security field this is something I

443
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,330
wanted to comment we are saying right

444
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:14,510
now is that the defender needs to be

445
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,250
almost perfect in gets you know

446
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,170
perfectly all the technologies that the

447
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:22,520
organization is used use in which is

448
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:26,810
something impossible I'm not saying that

449
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:33,350
the other side is easy but I think that

450
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:37,520
for people that are starting to work in

451
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:40,250
the field of cyber security age I think

452
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,389
that the offensive side is very

453
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,360
interesting there's a lot of knowledge

454
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:47,120
when I started knowledge was used inside

455
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,240
a library you had to look for books or

456
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,300
related to that on a library internet

457
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,740
set nothing about this university

458
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,780
talking about least just from time to

459
00:27:54,740 --> 00:28:01,010
time but now you can access all the

460
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:06,320
knowledge in the world for free and you

461
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:12,650
can access many different tools if you

462
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:14,270
download the nmap 90% of times yeah

463
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,090
beautiful you're going to have something

464
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:20,930
to do course you have to study a lot but

465
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:22,730
I think that this is a very good

466
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,740
opportunity to start working in the

467
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,630
field of cyber security you don't need

468
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,120
to be an expert on everything

469
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:38,240
depending on your specialization you

470
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:39,790
will realize very many people are

471
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,570
experts on

472
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:45,370
things and some issues if you become an

473
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,560
expert on something you don't need to

474
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:50,070
become an expert on everything and well

475
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:56,310
I think that it is also very fun very

476
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:59,710
interesting all right you try to connect

477
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:02,770
someplace and you need to introduce a

478
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:05,290
user in a password and you need to find

479
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,730
out the data I mean it's a very

480
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:09,639
interesting challenge and I think that

481
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:16,900
it may be very fun for young people and

482
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:20,230
then you tell someone especially a

483
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:23,020
teenager or a young person do not enter

484
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:26,440
that you cannot cross that door it

485
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:28,210
implies in motivating that person in

486
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:34,780
order to enter in to cross that door

487
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:37,810
right and symmetry of the attacker it

488
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:41,910
goes in line with the fact of having a

489
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:45,879
company with a budget of thousands of

490
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:49,260
millions of euros with a team devoted to

491
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:53,320
cyber security and on some in some cases

492
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:59,170
one person with a laptop remotely could

493
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:02,740
be able to skip the credentials part

494
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:05,650
because they have been licked VP and a

495
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:09,970
dozen ask for the double step

496
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,570
verification non encrypted backup and so

497
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,720
on

498
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:15,520
so that symmetry and asymmetry I think

499
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,680
is quite important in the beginning

500
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:24,690
Laurie talking about hacking but careful

501
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:28,410
we mentioned it earlier talking about

502
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:32,470
ethics it is quite easy to get lost

503
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:35,670
you're at your place your neighbours

504
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:39,370
network is quite easy to break through

505
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:42,010
then you can access their computers

506
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:44,919
their data and you think well I'm a good

507
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:47,260
boy I'm not doing anything harm but be

508
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,750
careful with the dark side because you

509
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:54,250
you are tempted by them

510
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:58,830
then they ring the doorbell rings and

511
00:30:54,250 --> 00:31:03,390
you are in the middle of a trouble I was

512
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:05,860
telling these stories in my classrooms

513
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:09,550
but apparently I didn't do it in the

514
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:12,969
right way because the smartest guy in my

515
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:16,750
class started to download things to do

516
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:20,500
things and the doorbell at his home rang

517
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,250
and he was in trouble I belonged to the

518
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:28,930
good side

519
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:34,470
not to the dark side in this journey of

520
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:38,290
this little boy who grew up to start

521
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:42,940
working at Intel in the red in the red

522
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:46,450
team but suddenly he had the chance to

523
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:52,240
become a civil servant and he passed the

524
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:53,860
exam so I started working on defense so

525
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,390
that's what people think about us

526
00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:02,199
about civil servants and this is how I

527
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:05,560
think that many civil servants not only

528
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:10,420
those devoted to cybersecurity but many

529
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:15,879
of others is to push to work to try to

530
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:19,930
improve our organizations try to

531
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,820
dismantle the myths on civil servants

532
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:26,920
during many civil servants in Spain

533
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:30,639
working hard to make things improve okay

534
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:34,570
so after everything we have said the

535
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:39,490
Eurofighter the Blue Team Red Team I

536
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:43,389
don't know what happened but these boy

537
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:48,120
was offered both tablets and then the

538
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:54,790
blue field was quite interesting with

539
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:57,330
report to him that what happens in the

540
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,330
blue team

541
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:12,470
kid in work on the nmap he can he had a

542
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:16,010
feeling inside he was anxious so he

543
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:20,300
decided to change sides and here I would

544
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:25,670
like to share reflection sometimes we

545
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:29,419
are afraid because you think I work on

546
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:34,780
IT but I'm working on development or on

547
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:38,570
systems what can I contribute with to

548
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:41,450
cybersecurity I'm sure I can't of course

549
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:44,899
you can't your room you have many things

550
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:48,710
to contribute with precisely the Public

551
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:51,290
Administration has teams with people

552
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:54,110
working on servers switches and so on

553
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:57,680
and they're welcoming the cybersecurity

554
00:33:54,110 --> 00:34:00,909
field we need their expertise we need

555
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:04,490
people who do not only know about

556
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:08,389
regulations and usage codes we need

557
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:11,120
people who are expert in technology what

558
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:14,419
about people in the development sector

559
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:17,690
we need people who understand a pro side

560
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:22,638
script we need somebody who understands

561
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:25,040
what a wasp is we need that background

562
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,889
and they will keep on learning once they

563
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:33,770
are part of our team we need people who

564
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:36,679
provides support to users we need those

565
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:39,610
people in order to help us because

566
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:43,700
sometimes there is a huge gap between

567
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:45,649
security and users as if there were no

568
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,960
link between them and there are some

569
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:55,250
people who work on user support which

570
00:34:47,960 --> 00:35:00,620
could be very useful for us boy this

571
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:03,320
young man became a defender we and it is

572
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:08,600
good to have a defender who knows how to

573
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:11,930
attack some people arrived in this cyber

574
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:15,210
security field without knowing water

575
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:19,640
what skully is they

576
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:24,540
know what West is so I'm not encouraging

577
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:26,970
you to change sites right now but the

578
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:30,570
blue team with people with hacking

579
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:35,459
knowledge would be unstoppable so these

580
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:39,180
young men took the blue pill and went to

581
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:41,609
work at the Ministry of Defense here is

582
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,980
what the Ministry of Defense does

583
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:46,830
because I'm sure that when you think

584
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,109
about it do you think it has only to do

585
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:54,420
with soldiers and so on but it is a

586
00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:58,140
vital Ministry in this country maybe you

587
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:01,440
can think of troops we mentioned Iraq

588
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:05,640
earlier just some soldiers in Iraq and

589
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:11,520
we have soldiers deployed in over 25

590
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:15,299
countries in the world I want you to

591
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:21,119
think that war shapes are moving all the

592
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:25,109
time planes flying cars movements are

593
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,480
made and the IT level it has to work and

594
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:30,480
of course at the cybersecurity level as

595
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,150
well so what these young men learned

596
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,700
from the Ministry of Defence basically

597
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:39,030
everything because he came from the red

598
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:41,220
team and he knew a lot about hacking but

599
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:46,609
wait a moment now you're on the blue

600
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:49,589
team so the conversation changes Newbery

601
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:52,920
we have a problem how are we going to

602
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:59,190
solve it then I had to start reading at

603
00:36:52,920 --> 00:37:01,020
night again both worlds are related but

604
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:03,210
they are quite different from each other

605
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:08,990
there are thousands of things to do in

606
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:12,660
public ministry all the concepts on

607
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:14,939
defense prevention detection response

608
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,890
you need to learn all that because

609
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,720
you're coming from the red team where

610
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:22,348
you do other stuff and you have a

611
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,939
different expertise teamwork and

612
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:25,040
willingness of course are quite

613
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,280
important

614
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:32,210
my the experience of these young

615
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:37,160
the Ministry of Defense was huge was

616
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:40,460
very important because he started to

617
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,640
think to realize that there are people

618
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:47,030
who are devoting their making their best

619
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:52,120
in order to defend our territory and our

620
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:54,740
society I'm not going to go in depth

621
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:58,670
because you already know who the

622
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:02,839
attackers are attackers who want to earn

623
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:06,160
money in a easy way activists who do not

624
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:10,400
agree with politicians and decide to

625
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:17,680
bother the society and countries which

626
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,680
I'm not going to mention these slide

627
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:28,430
young men used to use this slide in his

628
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:31,310
talks regarding the future soldier but

629
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:36,020
if you to the future wars are going to

630
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:42,190
be held in the cyber space this world is

631
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:46,460
changing at a very fast fast pace and

632
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:53,810
this is a reality in war as well in 2018

633
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:57,200
these men decided to change again he had

634
00:38:53,810 --> 00:39:00,650
been working for several years at the

635
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,439
Ministry of Defence and decided to start

636
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:09,560
working at the City Council of Madrid

637
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:13,910
quite weird right in he changed all the

638
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:16,580
troops deployed in the world for a small

639
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:21,350
city well I mean Madrid is big but it is

640
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:30,980
still a city so do you know what a city

641
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:33,589
council do you know all the paperwork it

642
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:38,660
must be important but what do they do

643
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:41,500
this how could many things many things

644
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:45,310
and many things which are close to sea

645
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:49,180
say aye aye I'm showing you here

646
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:52,779
everything that City Council has to do

647
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:55,230
so now think about everything that can

648
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,470
goes wrong if there is a cybersecurity

649
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,410
incident

650
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:02,830
you can get some anxiety from this slide

651
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:06,549
I can tell you and it is not a small

652
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:12,360
city cancer it is a big City Council it

653
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:12,360
is huge over 3 million of inhabitants

654
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:24,550
everything is at a big scale as for the

655
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:26,200
red team to be huge is great because

656
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,210
there is a lot of things that you can

657
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:32,379
attack on the blue team it is a

658
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:36,690
challenge to project all that this is

659
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:40,140
one hour in the City Council of Madrid

660
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:42,460
I'm sure you have seen graphs like this

661
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:45,160
according to what's going on on the

662
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:47,470
internet in just a minute but as you can

663
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,980
see on this slide there is a lot of flux

664
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:53,859
of information going in and out in one

665
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:56,620
hour in the city council so this man had

666
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:59,770
to manage cybersecurity at the City

667
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:02,910
Council of Madrid and here you have some

668
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:06,070
of the tasks the man was in charge of

669
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:09,730
maybe some of you cannot see the

670
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:12,430
importance of all of these tasks but if

671
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:16,390
the organisation at the strategic level

672
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:20,049
is not committed to cybersecurity it is

673
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:22,390
easy is it useless only to secure some

674
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:26,700
gadgets we need to have a cybersecurity

675
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:30,100
office that works 24/7 because otherwise

676
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:33,279
attackers might think well it is 5 p.m.

677
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:35,680
civil servants are not there anymore so

678
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,010
I'm not attacking them of course not we

679
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,350
need to work 24/7 there are many things

680
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:43,930
that we are trying to do in order for

681
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:48,430
our organization to be as resilient as

682
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:58,180
possible it is service and project-based

683
00:41:48,430 --> 00:42:02,740
approach it is important to have well a

684
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:05,049
well structured organization in IT in

685
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:09,339
the IT level everyone needs to know what

686
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:11,500
their turn their tasks are let's go back

687
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:14,380
to what I told you before this is the

688
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:17,590
typical sentence that generates some

689
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,780
anxiety we need to change my mindset how

690
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:22,660
am I going to work I'm not motivated

691
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:26,380
because I need to do it right all the

692
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:29,920
time it's true but you can turn it

693
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:34,120
around what you're saying is true but

694
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,840
once the attacker is present in my

695
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:42,549
network things change

696
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:44,890
from that moment on he's the one that

697
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:49,750
needs to do everything perfectly without

698
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:52,779
any mistakes any errors not over exceed

699
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:57,430
indirectly made of quartz because I just

700
00:42:52,780 --> 00:43:00,940
need a small clue to detect him it is

701
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:05,140
not as nice but I think that's a good

702
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:13,470
motivation this is also quite important

703
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:17,620
very important experience on many

704
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:21,669
organizations people go on their own IT

705
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:25,690
systems have their own problems so I

706
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:28,510
mean I'm here in my department I don't

707
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:31,630
care about the economic communications

708
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:33,400
department and there is no ting work

709
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:36,820
there is no collaborative work between

710
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,490
all the departments however all the

711
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,470
departments within an organization need

712
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:46,509
to work in an integrated and coordinated

713
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:50,799
way it is not about solving everyone

714
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:54,340
else's problems it is about making the

715
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,590
organization work we need if you have an

716
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:00,970
IT and communications department which

717
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:03,640
are great but the development department

718
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:07,810
verse whatever they want then we will

719
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:10,690
have a huge problem we also need to have

720
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:13,390
the support by the legal department who

721
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:17,170
and which understands the importance of

722
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:20,410
the clauses of a contract civil servants

723
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:24,670
and private sector professionals what

724
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:27,250
about merging them sometimes we think oh

725
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:30,820
no no I'm not a civil servant I'm just

726
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:32,890
doing a report and sending it no we are

727
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:36,340
working on the same team we are in the

728
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:39,210
same team we need collaboration of the

729
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:46,590
private sector in order to work in a

730
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:54,200
uniformed way this is another typical

731
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:55,890
sentence this ethical hacking team

732
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,720
[Music]

733
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:03,670
doesn't get along with the defendant

734
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:07,779
team what are they going to think about

735
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:10,060
me let's hinder the work you cannot do

736
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:15,520
that and so on there is a lack of

737
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:19,060
understanding of the fact that this job

738
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,430
is made to improve the organization we

739
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:24,029
need to use the ethical hacking team you

740
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:28,569
know the to improve as an organization

741
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:35,109
managers need to understand this another

742
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:38,890
point this coordination which I think

743
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:43,480
has experienced experienced a lot of

744
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:46,000
progress is essentially there are many

745
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,810
organizations which are working on the

746
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,640
same thing and even if the occurred

747
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:56,230
coordination has improved to assume from

748
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:59,859
more improvement I am talking about all

749
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:03,970
these areas departments because there

750
00:45:59,859 --> 00:46:08,310
are only two teams no more you have the

751
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:13,680
bad guys the good guys

752
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,680
nothing else we are all on the same side

753
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:22,399
en esta Linea in this line this man

754
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:25,609
together with all the civil servants who

755
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,369
were quite worried on these in this

756
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:32,598
regard they decided to create a

757
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:34,819
community where civil servants devoted

758
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:39,200
to cybersecurity could exchange

759
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:42,319
information sometimes we we struggle to

760
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:45,259
coordinate different organizations

761
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:47,270
because the director of one organization

762
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:49,849
needs to talk with the director of

763
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:53,559
another organization but in addition to

764
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:58,069
that organization coordination we need

765
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:59,839
to have civil servants to talk to each

766
00:46:58,069 --> 00:47:05,089
other because we are facing the same

767
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:08,569
problems solutions are the same the

768
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:11,660
stakeholder is the same I don't know in

769
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:15,049
private companies but for civil servants

770
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:20,299
we know citizens are the main

771
00:47:15,049 --> 00:47:22,579
stakeholder so we are launching a set of

772
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:26,720
activities in order to be able to

773
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:30,940
exchange ideas so that people are not

774
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:34,040
sitting in front of their computer

775
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:36,799
without knowing what to do and then they

776
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:38,779
don't do anything notaries hope you can

777
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:42,020
talk to other civil servants in order to

778
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:46,540
find your solutions so here you have our

779
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:49,819
social media account obviously I guess

780
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:52,700
you have figured out that the boy I was

781
00:47:49,819 --> 00:47:57,890
talking about is myself so what happened

782
00:47:52,700 --> 00:48:06,290
with the dreams of that young boy let's

783
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:09,700
see cyberspace airships and so on

784
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:14,480
no I'm not an astronaut like our

785
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:18,500
Minister Pedro Lucca but I was close I

786
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,540
talked and exchanged opinions with

787
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:24,010
people who had been working on those

788
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:25,550
projects so for me is almost fulfilled

789
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:28,970
obviously I'm

790
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:32,540
a plane pilot so I didn't fulfill that

791
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:36,730
dream better for me not to not have done

792
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:40,840
it but I have worked on the Eurofighter

793
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:43,430
project and other projects related to

794
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:47,390
airplanes so if you want to be

795
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:50,690
optimistic you can think that my dreams

796
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:53,799
were kind of fulfilled not about this

797
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:58,370
one I'm not a superhero unfortunately

798
00:48:53,800 --> 00:49:03,260
but let's reveal the story what were the

799
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:07,480
four virtues of a superhero they fight

800
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:11,570
against the evil ones Wow I think I'm

801
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:15,790
I'm fighting against those attackers on

802
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:19,340
the other side of the firewall so yes

803
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:21,620
superheroes defend citizens whoa I think

804
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,350
I have fulfilled this dream I'm working

805
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:28,700
to improve security for the city of

806
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:32,089
Madrid they they wear a uniform well

807
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:35,089
look at me I'm wearing one and what

808
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:38,480
about the last one superpowers no I do

809
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:41,470
not have superpowers but I think I could

810
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,360
because I can consider myself as been

811
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:47,839
three-quarters of a superhero maybe it

812
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:51,610
is a bad joke but it's somehow you can

813
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:55,580
see that this boy fulfilled his dreams

814
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:58,900
and we're running out of time so to

815
00:49:55,580 --> 00:50:03,170
conclude with I want to say that maybe

816
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:06,170
hackers on cybersecurity experts can

817
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:08,480
work on several things but in the end

818
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:12,560
what we are protecting is what lays

819
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:15,830
behind the technology is embedded in our

820
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:20,650
society so what we are protecting Indian

821
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:25,580
is public services hospitals cities

822
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:28,580
airspace our sovereignty I think that

823
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:31,759
those who devote themselves to cyber

824
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:35,480
security have the mission of defending

825
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:38,230
their society from those who want evil

826
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,230
to prevail

827
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:47,809
