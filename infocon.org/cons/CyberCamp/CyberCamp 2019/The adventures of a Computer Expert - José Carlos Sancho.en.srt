[Music]

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:21,029
thank you this is a good morning to

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,490
everyone my presentation is called The

4
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,099
Adventures of an expert on computing and

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:30,330
I want my presentation to be fun I want

6
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,910
to drop draft-dodger attention I want

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,510
you to ask me questions and of course I

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,179
want you to for you to know the

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:43,019
difficult tasks that involves that have

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,969
been computing expert it is a very

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,680
interesting job it is very well paid and

12
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,989
it is it also has a great potential for

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:58,800
technical and legal and technical people

14
00:00:51,989 --> 00:01:10,408
I think that it is a career which is

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:12,450
becoming more and more important well

16
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,700
I'm a professor in the Polytechnic

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:20,930
College School of the University of

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,930
Cassidy's and my estate number is 103

19
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:27,240
you know that we are computing expert

20
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,659
you need to be part of the computing

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,810
experts association I would like to also

22
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,640
introduce two people that have been

23
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,640
referenced for me in the field of

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,549
computing expertise these people are and

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,380
risk Adam he's my teacher he's taught me

26
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,390
everything I know and Jose Rodela

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:53,009
Garcia who's also very important

28
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:55,350
reference and we have half the chance to

29
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,450
create

30
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,119
degree in the university of Extremadura

31
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,420
of computing expertise and also I would

32
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,729
like to introduce to you my assistant

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,538
today this is the person that's going to

34
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,819
help me in this presentation he's going

35
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,049
to be asking some questions during my

36
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,200
presentation and

37
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,380
also terrifying some concepts I would

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,160
like to think of course in fever for

39
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,049
organizing cyber camp this is actually

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,020
my fourth or fifth cyber camp I

41
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,000
participated in Madurai 2015 I did a

42
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,390
presentation on forensic analysis of

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,270
this I started working on this bill in

44
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:40,260
2015 this picture was taken by one year

45
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,900
together with Ayane

46
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,570
and yen when other colleagues are in

47
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,550
charge of doing an investigation tasks

48
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,070
or in the event in 2016

49
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,590
I brought some students from the

50
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,660
University of leh of Extremadura to

51
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,340
participate in the hackathon of Leontes

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,700
not 16 I think this is very important

53
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,620
and in Mullica 2018 I gave a

54
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,679
presentation which was kind of

55
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,880
controversial because it was about

56
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:14,430
authentication systems of university and

57
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,130
what was my presentation about today

58
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:21,990
well my presentation is about four cases

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:24,570
well three real cases of on computing

60
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,400
expertise and also some problems and

61
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,040
recommendations about these professions

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,180
these cases are completely real these

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,840
are my so-called

64
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,980
adventures the first case is about an

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,170
information leak leakage of information

66
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,269
the second case is about an

67
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,519
investigation you know that you

68
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,260
invalidate some digital evidence for a

69
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,420
trial the third case is about taking

70
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,239
some payments between a company and the

71
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,459
administration's and finally I'm going

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,110
to talk about these difficulties and

73
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,290
recommendations but my objective in the

74
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,150
end of this presentation is to explain

75
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,489
real concepts applied to these real

76
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,950
cases concepts related to computing

77
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,740
expertise that may not sound very

78
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,470
important but that in the end are

79
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,750
significant and I want you to be aware

80
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,769
that this is important and that we need

81
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,769
more computing experts

82
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,039
first of all I want to ask this question

83
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,350
what forensic analysis we all know some

84
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,890
foreign forensic experts but we all

85
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:39,050
think about doctors right but forensic

86
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,710
analysis is Ana specialized technique

87
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,880
that allow allows us to identify

88
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,969
preserve and I will explain this later

89
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,530
and analyze digital evidence that are

90
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,870
going to be presented in a legal

91
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:55,640
procedure with the maximum technical and

92
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:58,400
preservation guarantees we will also

93
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,740
talk about the custody chain and in one

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,859
of the cases I will explain this chain

95
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,660
was completely broken doing these

96
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,280
forensic analysis is a methodological

97
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,010
process we need to be very

98
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:15,140
methodological we need to know

99
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:18,680
legislation in depth not to break off or

100
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:23,180
violate the basic rights of people and

101
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,670
we need to also pay attention you know

102
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,330
that not to invalidate digital evidence

103
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:32,780
we will see also how to do that and also

104
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,789
we need to be experts we need to have

105
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:40,609
expertise knowledge because afterwards

106
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:42,470
we will have faced a lot of we will have

107
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,540
to face judges and lawyers and we will

108
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,980
have to talk to them and answer the

109
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:53,720
questions so let's start with the

110
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:57,040
interesting things the first case was a

111
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:01,850
case related to an information leakage

112
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:07,940
this is these are real cases that happen

113
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:12,590
on daily basis in this case we had an

114
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:15,920
information leakage and this the

115
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:18,049
investigation needed to find out if an

116
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,530
employee of a company with a parent with

117
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,930
stealing information and I'm going to

118
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:27,919
give you more details what's what was

119
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:31,360
the context the background when we do an

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,640
expertise report we need to explain the

121
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,800
purpose of the report this was a company

122
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,650
without

123
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:44,540
that was in charge was devoted to

124
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:47,739
manufacturing manufacturing doors so

125
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,090
what is an computing expert doing in a

126
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,820
doorman factoring company well it's a

127
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:56,270
good question but I was working there in

128
00:06:52,820 --> 00:07:01,870
that case so then we have the employee

129
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:06,740
that we need to investigate this was an

130
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:11,210
investigation job and when the company

131
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,670
contacted us at first they said that the

132
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:22,489
employee was stealing information from

133
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:24,950
the company the holidays in August they

134
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:28,840
saw the employee putting a USB in a

135
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:32,570
computer of their of the company and

136
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:36,469
after holidays when they starting they

137
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:38,180
started manufacturing new designs the

138
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,600
employee was not working there anymore

139
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,850
and they couldn't keep on working on the

140
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,290
new designs so they had a problem with

141
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,860
the new designs and this is when they

142
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:52,190
decided to let us know about this

143
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:54,830
problem one of the biggest problems when

144
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,180
you are working as a computing expert in

145
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,430
a situation like this one is

146
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,190
understanding the context the scope and

147
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,650
the limitations this is why my assistant

148
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,140
is saying here you must think before

149
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,669
acting this is an important thing an

150
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,320
important idea to keep in mind you need

151
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,320
to know the system very well before

152
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:19,610
doing anything in this case the employee

153
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:22,580
was working in a manufacturing chain in

154
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:27,320
a production chain there were like eight

155
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:30,250
nine processes involved from the cut of

156
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:37,789
the materials they're designed

157
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:40,840
assembling testing etc the employee was

158
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:44,150
working specifically in the design area

159
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:48,410
so first the material of the door was

160
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:51,650
cut and then the design process to play

161
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:55,610
in which more accurate cuts were done in

162
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:57,110
the door etc and the important thing to

163
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:01,780
take into account is that the company

164
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:06,040
had a patent they had an assembling

165
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:10,010
system that made them very competitive

166
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,160
and the employee as I was saying was in

167
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:16,160
working in the second process of the

168
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,660
production chain he was working in a

169
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,310
machine that was connected to our

170
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:24,890
computer and that was in charge of of

171
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:30,770
performing the design so okay this is

172
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:36,140
the context we are understanding it as

173
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:38,270
we can see the employee had to type or

174
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,860
do to work on the computers in order to

175
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,590
generate the designs and the designs

176
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,950
were generated with some coordinates

177
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:48,410
this machine would interpret the

178
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:54,110
coordinates from the computer later and

179
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:59,870
apply them second thing that we need to

180
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:01,280
do is to establish the facts so we said

181
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,270
that in our report we need to say the

182
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,819
purpose the scope and now the we need to

183
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,980
establish the facts the first thing that

184
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,430
we started thinking as experts and

185
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:17,360
investigators was that we needed to

186
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:20,750
study the information that existed in

187
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,090
that USP so before acting before doing

188
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:28,880
anything we needed to analyze the

189
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:33,500
information existing in that USP then we

190
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,650
had to compare that information and to

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,610
see if it was related with the

192
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,459
production information of the company

193
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,910
which is logical and then we have we had

194
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:46,130
to look for possible evidence is that

195
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,589
show that there has been an information

196
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,420
leakage from the company we need to look

197
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:54,320
for the evidence that showed that there

198
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:59,689
was a leakage of information well in

199
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,740
also in all reports we are going to say

200
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,630
that the expert

201
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,870
not going to assess the content on the

202
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:08,630
digital evidence the expert is just

203
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:12,170
going to use the information in order to

204
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:21,350
establish that possible leakage of

205
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:23,990
information so starting point so to

206
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,230
speak and this is how or when we can

207
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:30,110
start working with our digital evidence

208
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:33,620
our digital evidence was once so far

209
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:38,899
which was the USB USB that the company

210
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:42,800
gave us and that the police had taken

211
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:48,050
from the from the employee so the police

212
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:50,479
force was involved I was saying before

213
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:54,500
that it is very important to preserve

214
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,930
the evidence this means not we don't

215
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,520
have to alter or manipulate the evidence

216
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:05,290
because otherwise we are going to

217
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:07,850
invalidate the evidence so here we are

218
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,520
we are in a position of advantage

219
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,320
compared to doctors forensic doctors

220
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:18,589
because we can take the digital evidence

221
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:23,690
and we can do an identical copy and and

222
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:26,870
that's exactly the same as the real

223
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:28,910
evidence as you may imagine forensic

224
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,820
doctors cannot clone cannot duplicate

225
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:35,810
people so this is an advantage that

226
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,120
without that we have this preservation

227
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,630
of the evidence is done through

228
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,540
different coding software's we can do an

229
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:54,260
image of the pendrive a USB and clone

230
00:12:44,540 --> 00:13:00,310
that image and we have to also show that

231
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:02,990
the evidence is preserved and that a day

232
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,420
and when if we calculate their hands

233
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,430
code which I will explain later we can

234
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,969
guarantee that we have an exact copy of

235
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:14,630
the evidence in this case

236
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:18,880
ah so si la policía de hecho I didn't

237
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:23,890
know if that police forces had done

238
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:27,350
duplication of the USB before so we

239
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:31,819
duplicated these USB before an artery

240
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,740
and we left a copy also on that notary

241
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,280
obviously know that to preserve these

242
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:39,920
costly change next thing that we have to

243
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,370
do is analyzing the information on that

244
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,219
USB so once we have the copy the

245
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:51,230
truthful copy of the USB they the real

246
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:53,330
USB is not being used was not being used

247
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,540
we are working all the time with a copy

248
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,550
with a replica replicate because if when

249
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,530
working with the USB we make a mistake

250
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:03,620
we delete something we changed something

251
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:05,930
we can clone again we can duplicate

252
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,690
again the original USB and restarts you

253
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:12,620
the process so this is why working with

254
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,990
a duplicate is important so once we

255
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:25,220
started analyzing the USB we realized

256
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:33,170
that there were files sequential namings

257
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:37,130
from 1 to 512 and these files contained

258
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:39,829
the design and the recycling the design

259
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,160
of the machine used in the design

260
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,160
process

261
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,600
so what what's next I want to ask you

262
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:56,060
that question once we've analyzed that

263
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:58,070
information what should we do so our

264
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,729
next step is starting the investigation

265
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:08,660
we have to go beyond we need to look for

266
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:13,010
things that may not be visible and this

267
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:16,219
implies looking for information

268
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:20,529
information exhaustively you know you

269
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:25,329
speak we can look for the hidden in

270
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:28,149
when we put information in a USB we put

271
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:32,920
music etc and afterwards we delete that

272
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:36,069
music physically physically you are not

273
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:40,329
deleting that information I mean

274
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:42,399
something physical physically deleting

275
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:45,430
something is something when you delete

276
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,329
with an eraser on a paper but when we

277
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:53,019
are talking about the computing field

278
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:55,420
there is a logical erasing you are going

279
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:58,449
to delete something in order to have

280
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,219
space to put more things but the

281
00:15:58,449 --> 00:16:04,209
information is still there and that's

282
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:07,689
what the forensic analysis implies we

283
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:10,119
are going to recover this deleted

284
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:13,629
information once we've deleted that

285
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,120
information we can study the metadata

286
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:20,379
which is something very important when

287
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,600
drafting an expert an expertise report

288
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:26,170
and then we have to order to organize

289
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,860
that information do you know what we

290
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:35,949
found out well when we did that

291
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:38,259
information analysis we realized that we

292
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:44,579
had files from one to five hundred and

293
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:50,410
twenty but we were deleted files from

294
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:55,149
121 to 867 and there was other type of

295
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:57,639
information - such as index that

296
00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:00,490
indicated to which part corresponding

297
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:05,709
age design and also there were images

298
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:07,929
with work with word commands so first

299
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:12,250
evidence is that we that there was

300
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:20,669
information deleted from that USB so now

301
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:20,669
what what's next so once we found that

302
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,799
we had we needed to count on other

303
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:33,840
digital evidence which is the computer

304
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,840
of the company we went

305
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:40,650
to the company we got the hard disk and

306
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:44,060
we did a copy of the hardest and gave

307
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:51,110
the original hardest back to the company

308
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:55,169
what for well in order to establish if

309
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:57,540
in the computer of the company they only

310
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,410
had files from one to five hundred and

311
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:04,950
twenty one or and if the rest of files

312
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:08,670
had been deleted - as in the USB when we

313
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:11,130
lead that process we realized that in

314
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:15,230
the computer of the company there were

315
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:19,820
only files from one to five hundred

316
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:24,390
nineteen and they were all visible but

317
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,250
in the USB we had files from one to

318
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:30,600
eight hundred and sixteen as we've said

319
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:34,200
before so you can start guessing what's

320
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,510
happening here what where our

321
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,510
conclusions which is the most important

322
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,670
part because of course we can draft a

323
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:47,220
report which may be very technical but

324
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:50,850
in the end conclusions need to be clear

325
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:53,580
so that adjust or anyone else can

326
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:56,040
understand what's happening so we showed

327
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,899
that the USB was connected to the

328
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:04,710
computer that that's the first thing we

329
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:06,360
could show we can get to know which

330
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,090
devices have been connected to our

331
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:14,280
computer and we can also check the

332
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:21,959
serial number and what else could we

333
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:26,639
show on the 13th of August showed that

334
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:29,520
the file but the files had information

335
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,620
related to their productive productivity

336
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,680
of the company also we could prove that

337
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,590
depend that the USB had deleted files

338
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:43,200
that were related to the signs of the

339
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:44,649
activity of the company and finally we

340
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,260
need to to be

341
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:50,160
in our conclusions and we said that

342
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:55,030
there were deleted files that which is

343
00:19:50,160 --> 00:20:00,580
stored in the USB of the employee and

344
00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:03,610
not in the computer of the company so

345
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:07,919
this explains a little bit more of the

346
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:11,669
situation what happened then the court

347
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:17,680
statements in courts this is image or of

348
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:22,110
a court of the disposition of chairs and

349
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:27,610
tables in a court normally experts

350
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:32,080
intervene at the end so at first the

351
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:34,419
defense witnesses intervene and at the

352
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,020
end there is a intervention of the

353
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,560
expert

354
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:43,379
it's what usually happens when I went to

355
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:47,050
the to the court I was there in the door

356
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:50,080
waiting to be called and they call me

357
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:54,550
the first to declare which was quite

358
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:58,470
weird and they just asked me good we can

359
00:20:54,550 --> 00:21:04,210
see that they device as a security copy

360
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:06,370
no because in order for an L and a

361
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,980
device to be consider as a security copy

362
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:14,350
it must be stored in two devices not

363
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:16,870
just in one half had the files being

364
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,129
created in working during working hours

365
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:22,239
this is something that I didn't

366
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:24,580
understand at first but they just asked

367
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,020
me that question yes the files had been

368
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:35,470
created in during the working hours this

369
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:38,560
was written on the report I started I

370
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:41,290
didn't know why this metadata were

371
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,669
useful but sometimes you have questions

372
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:46,800
such as these ones and you can answer

373
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,800
because of that information and also

374
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:57,248
hard files being erased after the

375
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:01,629
employee went on holidays and I said yes

376
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:07,309
and can you know what's the date of ha

377
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:09,799
file once it it has been erased no but

378
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,690
when you recover it you can get to know

379
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:17,299
that information so the judge asked me

380
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:18,830
if files had been erased after the 13th

381
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:21,950
of August after the employee went on

382
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:25,428
holidays and yes it was true because

383
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:28,099
there were files from 14 15 of August or

384
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:31,820
even from September that had been erased

385
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:33,678
so if they were created after the 13th

386
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,470
of August and then they had been deleted

387
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:40,460
it means that that some files were

388
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:44,389
erased that with a date later than May

389
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:47,359
13th of August the employee said that he

390
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:48,830
needed that those files because he

391
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,689
needed to work at home he didn't have

392
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,349
enough enough time to finish during the

393
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,200
working hours

394
00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:59,869
however the files had been created

395
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:01,909
during the working hours and well in the

396
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:05,779
end the employee anyway was saying that

397
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:10,539
he was taking work um so well as a

398
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:10,539
summary and regarding the resolution to

399
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,299
summary here is that first of all we

400
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,519
need to understand the context the

401
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:22,158
background we need to preserve the USB

402
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,210
this means we need to replicate to clone

403
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,799
a USB we did this before in our train we

404
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:32,570
left a copy there too

405
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:35,989
also we must have you must want an

406
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,939
information analysis then we need to

407
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:39,859
start doing the investigation and we

408
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:44,539
need to start recovering the information

409
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:47,299
of the USB these deleted files also as

410
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:50,440
we've when we saw that they were eyes

411
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:53,869
that had been deleted we decided to

412
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,879
duplicate the hard drive the hard disk

413
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:58,488
of the company of the computer of the

414
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:59,599
company then we also recover the

415
00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:02,440
information of the computer of the

416
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:06,289
company compare the results and deliver

417
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:11,349
an expertise report of course after that

418
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:11,349
the employee decided to report the calm

419
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:25,960
and the conclusion of the sentence the

420
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,300
conclusions of the sentence were similar

421
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,370
to the conclusions that we have dropped

422
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,669
across it in their reports of it just

423
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,939
completely trusted our report in the

424
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,410
expertise information that we gave him

425
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,690
now we are going to move to the second

426
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:44,020
case case which was the invalidation of

427
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,580
digital evidence this was a shocking

428
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,570
case for me and I'm sure it will be a

429
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,570
shocking case for you too

430
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:56,500
means that in a court sometimes there in

431
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:59,350
this case in a court some these are

432
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,000
evidence were presented but I'm going to

433
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,740
give you more context so there there was

434
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,059
a building company that was in charge of

435
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:11,440
building houses and buildings in general

436
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:16,300
second trucks a construction company in

437
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:21,130
general and well the bank can provide

438
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:26,500
loans to the companies so the company

439
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:31,750
and the body were fighting for loan of

440
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:39,090
more than 20 euros 20 million euros very

441
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:44,320
bit it's important to say that and

442
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:46,720
experts computing experts do not have a

443
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,620
salary based on Commission's which would

444
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:55,360
have been been very interesting for us

445
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:58,719
in this case with a 20 million euros so

446
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,209
we'll scope and limitations we know that

447
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,870
there were three detailed evidence that

448
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:09,460
could be used as contracts so the

449
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:20,409
problem started here because it was said

450
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:22,480
that this loan granted in 2008 toxic

451
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,790
interest with all

452
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,550
we've all heard about these toxic

453
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:32,580
interest of sunken entities but the

454
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:35,050
digital evidence that the banking

455
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,110
presented in the court we're not

456
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:41,230
presented on the right terms and we will

457
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,389
see what what happened later have you

458
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,790
seen what happened to my assistant he's

459
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:48,910
turning around because he couldn't

460
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:51,940
believe what he was seeing seriously are

461
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:55,950
these the evidence so there was just a

462
00:26:51,940 --> 00:27:00,010
CD with our own conversation from 2008

463
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:05,430
that at first was not cutter as an

464
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:11,650
evidence but that that never was never

465
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:14,740
sent to the construction company so at

466
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:17,170
first two cities were delivered one for

467
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:21,010
the jury and word for one for the

468
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:23,560
construction company and also all the

469
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:27,730
other evidence were two emails and that

470
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:31,110
were provided us screenshots that's not

471
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:35,590
mean that's not being very serious right

472
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:40,209
so this is a very serious case we said

473
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:42,340
20 million euro loan involved and these

474
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:46,810
are the digital evidence provided by the

475
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:50,379
banking entity the conversation was

476
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:52,899
seven minutes long and we try to

477
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,120
establish if the conversation had been

478
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:59,020
cut at some points and if the

479
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,409
conversation had been manipulated then

480
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:04,690
we move to the establishing the facts we

481
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,730
studied the audio CDs provided

482
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:11,110
corresponding to that conversation of

483
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:14,770
2008 and also we studied if we analyzed

484
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:17,139
if the emails were valid or not the

485
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:19,810
expert again is not going to assess the

486
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,060
content of the digital evidence we are

487
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,919
just going to treat these as technical

488
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:30,360
evidence from the technical point of

489
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:30,360
view and I need to make a comment here

490
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:46,190
law says that a electronic document is

491
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:52,190
the information in electronic format in

492
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:55,940
an electronic support which can be

493
00:28:52,190 --> 00:29:01,460
identified and treated in a different

494
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:05,750
way we are used to print in emails but

495
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:10,120
that's not the format you need to hand

496
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:14,149
them in with the integrity and

497
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:17,178
authentication principle how can you get

498
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:21,590
that integrity you need to extract the

499
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:24,470
ID card we all have our own

500
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:27,110
identification number which is the hash

501
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:31,490
which is going to warranty that the

502
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:34,219
copies that we can make from me they are

503
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:38,440
exactly the same as me so you need to

504
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,679
have an identical copy of the original

505
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:46,850
okay

506
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:50,029
so far so good add an authentication it

507
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,789
is important that professionals are

508
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:56,779
following the professional code are in

509
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:58,789
charge of drafting these experts report

510
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:03,640
because they have proven their

511
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:09,559
qualification some recent sentences are

512
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:11,980
required are discarding experts report

513
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:18,649
because they didn't have these required

514
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:21,399
qualification it is important that the

515
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:24,889
evidence has not been tampered with

516
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:28,459
through documentation of the access

517
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:33,470
process tension transference and storage

518
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:36,950
we also need to follow those rules we

519
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:42,730
have to follow those principles which

520
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:46,639
are essential authenticity and integrity

521
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:49,750
ok do you remember where we were at we

522
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:54,889
were saying that

523
00:30:49,750 --> 00:31:01,220
we have three digital evidences CDs two

524
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:04,190
males but the CD never reached the

525
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:08,480
construction company so we requested a

526
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:12,200
copy from the cold but the current had

527
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,870
lost the evidence yes as you hear it

528
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:17,720
the cord had lost that evidence and

529
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:24,709
that's when you start to be angry

530
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:27,710
well the deed was to talk to the

531
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:30,860
construction company and they said I

532
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:34,940
have a copy and I can send it to you so

533
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:38,240
here I just analyzed a generation and

534
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:42,070
modification dates from this file from

535
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:45,580
CD one but some days before the hearing

536
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,580
by turns

537
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:52,429
they found the evidence because we had

538
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:56,600
requested them to look for it and they

539
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:58,730
found this tell this phone call this

540
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,370
phone conversation which was the only

541
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:03,559
evidence between that conversation

542
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:07,219
between the bank and the construction

543
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:10,399
company but this even if they hadn't

544
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:13,100
sent anything conversation can be

545
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,309
considered as an agreement so when we

546
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:20,230
analyzed the CD from the court what do

547
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:26,360
you think that happened the conversation

548
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:30,679
was made in 2008 here we have a copy of

549
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,740
the one instructed in 2018 by the other

550
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:37,940
part by the bank part do you know what

551
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:42,230
happened we got the CD and when we

552
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:47,630
analyzed it they lost CD their creation

553
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:50,210
the date was January the first in 1995

554
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:55,299
and I'm not kidding you this is not a

555
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:57,919
joke I guess you're as shocked as I was

556
00:32:55,299 --> 00:33:00,610
when I saw it I thought okay this is

557
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:06,169
wrong it's something that it is

558
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:09,408
that cannot be possible but it was true

559
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:13,580
I mean these was a falsified evidence it

560
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:18,080
had been tampered with we cannot see the

561
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:20,240
name the kind of the format the date

562
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,779
didn't match there were two completely

563
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:27,679
different evidences and then we have

564
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:34,580
email one an email to which were in PDF

565
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:37,759
format when you print email it doesn't

566
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:44,269
warranty it's legal validity because you

567
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:46,759
can scan them and tamper them with and

568
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:50,950
we can make Batman to speak with

569
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,950
spider-man if we want in an email

570
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:58,429
the mail is a file in our gmail account

571
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:00,590
we can push a button to show the

572
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:02,929
original you know that you downloaded

573
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:07,039
and there are different files in

574
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:10,129
different formats but it is necessary to

575
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,560
identify the header of the Gmail with

576
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:17,690
the person who sends a email the person

577
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:21,020
who receives it and so on conclusion we

578
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:26,300
started several conclusions the main one

579
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:29,629
is that these expert affirms that from

580
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:33,740
the expert point of view the digital

581
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:38,899
evidences are invalid CD 1 CD to email

582
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:41,118
one an email to why because they these

583
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:46,399
evidences were not presented

584
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:50,929
according to adequate computing experts

585
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:54,348
procedures and the custody chain was

586
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:58,900
lost and then we couldn't know what the

587
00:34:54,349 --> 00:35:04,119
where the origin of had had been created

588
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:05,359
imagine myself going to trial

589
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:08,810
invalidating

590
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:12,170
the digital evidences can you imagine

591
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:14,520
what happened in the court in the

592
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:18,020
beginning the church

593
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:21,420
didn't want to accept the experts report

594
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:25,200
first of all because she wanted to

595
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:29,780
assess the whole case as if evidence

596
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:35,368
were true reasons for that opaque

597
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:37,770
obviously because those evidence hadn't

598
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:42,570
been presented in the appropriate way

599
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:46,320
and then questions by trade by the judge

600
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:50,760
but I would have loved to ask the judge

601
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:53,690
who extracted that conversation in the

602
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,640
back was it tempered tempered with

603
00:35:53,690 --> 00:36:01,700
because I saw there were some cuts in

604
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:06,680
that conversation is the experts report

605
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:11,160
invalid I mean I think judges need to

606
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:14,520
trust technical teams and at least

607
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:20,339
accept and assess what's going on even

608
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:22,680
if it's not nice I told you dad I was

609
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:33,960
going to share my opinion and I'm doing

610
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:43,290
it this case one-day trial they didn't

611
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:49,560
want to record to all the higher digital

612
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:53,040
evidence should be presented CD one and

613
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:55,740
CD 2 the name of the file the size of

614
00:36:53,040 --> 00:37:01,080
the file extension the day of

615
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:04,290
modification the time and hashes md5 on

616
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:07,529
any other hash because you can use

617
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:12,240
different hash which are encryption

618
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:15,230
algorithms you have the file you use

619
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,439
this algorithm and then you have

620
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:22,220
alphanumeric code that identifies

621
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,290
uniquely that file you can tell me

622
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:28,950
encryption algorithms are broken yes

623
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:32,070
they are all broken that means there

624
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:38,009
have been issues which means that two

625
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:44,280
different files had the same hash but it

626
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:46,740
has never been proven that two hashes to

627
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,610
different hashes for the same file that

628
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:54,270
has never been proven in da

629
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:57,690
documentation index which is available

630
00:37:54,270 --> 00:38:01,860
for different lawyers and the judge they

631
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:07,610
have the hash that identifies every file

632
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:12,450
whether it is electronics or not case 3

633
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:17,060
I know that the two first case is where

634
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:17,060
high level and this one is software okay

635
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:38,660
this is the check in next start an

636
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:43,950
investigation process looking for

637
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:47,460
evidences secondly we can check the

638
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:51,060
validity of those evidence and in this

639
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:54,080
third case we're going to compare some

640
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:58,770
data with all the data especially with

641
00:38:54,080 --> 00:39:02,580
economic issues in between I'm going to

642
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:06,390
speak about bus company I'm yes I am a

643
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:08,910
computer expert but I am working this

644
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,129
bus company and then on the other hand

645
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:13,080
we have a public administration so you

646
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:15,270
might think what is the relationship

647
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:18,319
between them well geez bus company is

648
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:27,170
offering a public service because

649
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:33,920
transport in regions are funded by by

650
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:35,200
general funds and this is what links

651
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,089
they

652
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:43,899
services that these this company

653
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:46,420
provides and then the funds that the

654
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,300
public administration gave them and then

655
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:52,270
the problem comes when these numbers do

656
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:57,640
not match we need to compare the

657
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:59,589
services from the company with the with

658
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:06,359
the funds by the other public

659
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:10,270
administration if if a bus provides the

660
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:16,410
service every Monday Wednesday and

661
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:21,099
Friday obviously every all those days

662
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:23,799
have proven to offer a service and then

663
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:27,579
if the days do not match between both

664
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,530
parts then you need to hire an expert a

665
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:32,440
computing expert

666
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:35,880
every service which means every time a

667
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:40,060
bus starts a route the was a line

668
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:44,290
created in a txt in a text file and

669
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:49,240
every ticket but also generated another

670
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:52,900
line in a text file eventually those

671
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:57,578
lines in the txt files

672
00:40:52,900 --> 00:41:02,640
well they output that the company sends

673
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:02,640
to the public administration in all then

674
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:09,759
carry out the payoffs every six months

675
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:11,670
to come the company sends these

676
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:17,520
documents and the public administration

677
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:21,520
pays every six months a little comment

678
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:25,270
txt files of two meters or three meters

679
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,460
so you can imagine how much information

680
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:31,930
there was according to services and

681
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:35,050
wicked antion tickets and the payoff was

682
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:40,029
made in an Excel and we need to we

683
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:43,089
needed to compare both both excels to

684
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:46,400
see the difference so I had to wait I

685
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:50,710
still have to wait to go to

686
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,059
the current but the first thing is that

687
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:56,589
it is impossible for the public

688
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:59,029
administration do you have had to be

689
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:00,859
reliable control on the services

690
00:41:59,029 --> 00:42:02,809
provided by the company because the

691
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:06,319
company is the one that sends that

692
00:42:02,809 --> 00:42:08,569
information and every month this report

693
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:11,150
is sent to the public administration

694
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:14,210
that system is not well designed for a

695
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:17,059
public trans trans port service the bus

696
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:19,069
should send directly to the company and

697
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:21,829
to the public administration that

698
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:24,680
information which is generated and it

699
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:27,440
shouldn't go first by the company that

700
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,328
information should be sent at the same

701
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,880
time to the company and to the public

702
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:38,539
administration which requires a change

703
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:44,980
in design logically both files do not

704
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:48,289
match public administration information

705
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:51,430
doesn't match with the best company's

706
00:42:48,289 --> 00:42:54,650
information and there are quite a few

707
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:58,730
differences between them and something

708
00:42:54,650 --> 00:43:03,619
like that is quite weird but as I said

709
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:08,390
we have to we still have to wait but I

710
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:12,380
wanted to explain to you this procedure

711
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:17,240
of analyzing and comparing different

712
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:24,140
files there it's been eight months of

713
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:27,890
hard work and in the end we have ripped

714
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:30,430
some fruits and we have extracted some

715
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:33,170
conclusions and we'll see how it ends

716
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,750
I'm going to move on to the last part

717
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:41,690
which is difficulties and

718
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:47,750
recommendations what are difficulties

719
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:53,930
that an expert faces well you can I then

720
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:57,710
you may already know them I worked for a

721
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:59,379
company that manufactures door bus

722
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:03,329
company

723
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:07,809
an agricultural company a real estate

724
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:09,849
company so those are the cases that I

725
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:12,940
have been in charge of in the last

726
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:15,640
year's and the difficult part is to get

727
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:18,940
you know in depth the contact the

728
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:22,029
context and how you can isolate all the

729
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:24,369
evidence so that everyone can understand

730
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:28,240
it that's the most difficult part of the

731
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:31,410
expert because as for the technical part

732
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,839
once you start working with evidence is

733
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:37,720
no longer interesting what is difficult

734
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,700
is the new challenge of faith in

735
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,970
different procedures and processes

736
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:45,549
within companies you don't know those

737
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:50,259
processes you need to learn I have

738
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:52,990
learned a lot about buses I didn't learn

739
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:57,039
that much of a doors but about buses I

740
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:59,049
did and you need to isolate all the case

741
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:03,420
and to build the case that's the most

742
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:09,480
difficult part as for recommendations an

743
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:09,480
expert needs to be unbiased objective

744
00:45:09,569 --> 00:45:19,750
and needs to know the responsibility

745
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:24,069
because it is not only about telling the

746
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:29,349
truth when the expert gets to know the

747
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:32,049
faults there is no other option than

748
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:36,490
telling the truth being responsible and

749
00:45:32,049 --> 00:45:39,190
objective and act as an expert should

750
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:43,439
act and this is the last thing which is

751
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:47,289
the professional code of ethical code

752
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,990
all computing professionals and in the

753
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:54,309
field of communications also doctors

754
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:59,258
every professional group has an ethical

755
00:45:54,309 --> 00:46:02,980
code which is designed to comply with

756
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:06,309
several aspects which cannot question

757
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:09,329
our value we need to be objective we

758
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:12,040
need to keep confession via

759
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:14,350
confidentiality integrity

760
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:17,259
do you have skills I mean you need to

761
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:20,080
have enough skills and knowledge in

762
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:24,280
order to face different cases with

763
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:28,960
warranties and if you are not an expert

764
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:35,400
in some fields do not worry you can

765
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:37,930
discard that case you can reject it I'm

766
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:42,030
getting to the end of my presentation

767
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:46,690
but I wanted to mention that recently I

768
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:51,030
have found that digital evidences are

769
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,030
not presented in the appropriate way

770
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:59,560
have the power to admit an evidence

771
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:03,040
which may have been created in an

772
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:06,880
invalid way there are some parts

773
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,160
especially social and label part which

774
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,210
allow those evidences

775
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:16,240
however in criminal courts they are more

776
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:20,730
strict and I think we all the courts

777
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,729
should be as discreet I am that

778
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:28,270
efficiencies are nor well presented

779
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:40,440
however they are not rejected and that

780
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:43,480
has a consequence on the dispute and

781
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:48,490
Indian that part is going to be the one

782
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:50,800
that pays for it so in the last cases

783
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,439
I'm working mainly on whatsapp

784
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,200
conversations

785
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:00,070
logically our life is on social media

786
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,710
and many of our conversations are take

787
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:05,470
place in what's up

788
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:10,390
since whatsapp created the option of

789
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:13,480
deleting your messages was a turn was a

790
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:16,060
very important moment for experts you

791
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:20,070
need to check if the mobile phone is not

792
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:24,650
rooted you need to know if there is not

793
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:29,300
security copy with a date later the

794
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:32,210
the conversation it is easy it is not

795
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:36,010
easy to tamper with whatsapp

796
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:39,680
conversations but it's possible to do it

797
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:42,650
it is also possible to have another

798
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,930
device which is routed another device

799
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:48,200
which is not you tamper with

800
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:51,529
conversations in that rooted device and

801
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:54,439
you deployed a security copy in a non

802
00:48:51,530 --> 00:49:00,770
rooted device that's why we need to do

803
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:05,510
those verifications today in trials we

804
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:11,110
still allow to present screenshots what

805
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:13,730
is from what because the one which

806
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:20,810
contests is the one who is going to pay

807
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:25,130
for the experts report but what happens

808
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:29,480
with what's up in a case in which we

809
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:32,920
have a conversation on an and screenshot

810
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:37,190
and then I go to my client and say

811
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:41,810
contest the evidence and delete the

812
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:44,870
messages in your devices at the moment

813
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:47,210
when you're contesting the evidence you

814
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:51,799
are saying that it doesn't warranty the

815
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:54,410
custody chain and then the other person

816
00:49:51,800 --> 00:50:00,320
deletes their messages which will never

817
00:49:54,410 --> 00:50:05,210
be recovered and lawyers then lost their

818
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:10,580
digital evidence this is the end of my

819
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:15,070
presentation and I wanted to make judges

820
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:17,720
and lawyers understand and maybe experts

821
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:21,260
needs to be more prepared

822
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:24,350
maybe we need experts but I think that

823
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:26,900
judges need to understand the

824
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:30,500
responsibility they have you know that

825
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:32,360
we only accept evidences that are

826
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,850
presented in a correct way

827
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:38,780
I hope that

828
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:41,720
dey's intervention was interesting for

829
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,760
you and i would like to thank you for

830
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,520
being here and i will continue with my

831
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,590
adventures to talk about them the

832
00:50:46,520 --> 00:51:11,900
following year thank you very much and

833
00:50:48,590 --> 00:51:16,310
open to any questions you may have you

834
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:19,570
said that recordings were lions it was a

835
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:23,150
copy from a computer but in an audio

836
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:27,740
recording and you want to change the

837
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:31,730
date that recording is played in a

838
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:38,709
loudspeaker and you recorded in your

839
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:42,500
team in your laptop and you recorded

840
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:45,140
with whatever quality it has how can you

841
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:49,220
know it is the original one or not you

842
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:53,529
cannot know it in these cases these

843
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:56,810
digital evidence may be in a system that

844
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:59,570
the expert is going to use in order to

845
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:01,820
extract the audio file in an appropriate

846
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:05,020
way for example if we're speaking about

847
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:10,190
our watts of conversation and there is a

848
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:12,380
two-part audio there is an audio maybe

849
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:17,090
you can ask the other person who

850
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:19,760
received the audio file to check if they

851
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:22,430
are the same but it is true they can be

852
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,640
tampered with the expert in that case

853
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:28,040
needs to check if the second evidence

854
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,799
the one that is recorded on the

855
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,420
loudspeaker mr check if that's the

856
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,090
original one because if we're speaking

857
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,670
about an audio file or about whatsapp

858
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:41,680
conversation

859
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:44,559
I don't want them to show me the

860
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:48,430
conversation extracted in a different

861
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:51,130
computer no I want to intervene in the

862
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:53,819
system that records otherwise I want to

863
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:57,190
present that evidence in court either I

864
00:52:53,819 --> 00:52:59,020
extracted from the system that recorded

865
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:01,720
the audio because I know it's the

866
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:07,299
original wall or I won't present any

867
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:08,618
evidence so for example we have recorded

868
00:53:07,299 --> 00:53:13,119
here right now

869
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:16,930
so if I play this sound and I recorded

870
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:20,200
with my computer you cannot know if you

871
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:24,520
have spoken today or any other way and

872
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:28,450
when you record that in CD or they meter

873
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:32,980
data still in the computer yes for

874
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:35,470
example when you record in mp3 the the

875
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:39,130
meta data from the original wall are

876
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:44,109
still saved you can do it in PDF Word

877
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:51,790
and notify whatever if it's online it is

878
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:55,569
the data are stored right but if you

879
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:59,859
change your computer's date can you know

880
00:53:55,569 --> 00:54:03,790
if the date has been modified well if

881
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:07,210
you have down an identical copy so

882
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:09,490
control-c control-v of any electronic

883
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:12,730
file that's an identical copy to the

884
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:16,089
original one okay no in that case I

885
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:20,470
wasn't referring to an identical copy

886
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:22,328
but to record from the original why and

887
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:24,430
then you disconnect from the internet

888
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:29,049
you know they know to update the date

889
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:32,348
and then you emulate the moment yes

890
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:36,460
that's the conclusion I extracted from

891
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:38,950
the conversation of the of the

892
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:43,990
conversation it was a manipulation it

893
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:49,210
was a tempering so they tried to modify

894
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:50,799
the date and as you saw it was 1995

895
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:53,640
but if you

896
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:57,550
do not have an evidence to match it with

897
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:59,410
can it be admitted I'm sorry guys but

898
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:03,060
you're running out of time

899
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:04,899
you can keep on discussing outside

900
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:09,130
please

901
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:12,260
