[Music]

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:18,180
well I said already mention my name is

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:20,970
Jose selvi I'm from here in Valencia

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,820
I've been working in cybersecurity for

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,229
many many years and working with

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:33,320
multinational companies for the last few

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:39,120
years I'm an NCC grouper which is a

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:42,660
British company originally and I'm going

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:48,949
to talk a little bit about how I started

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:52,140
in the world of learning and this has

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:55,410
basically I work in penetration testing

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:01,590
it's looking for faults breaking things

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:06,030
and so on so around ten years ago I

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,250
started to with machine learning because

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,630
I was doing my doctorate to my PhD at

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,430
the time and what this was one of the

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,658
subjects that came up and one of the

18
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:22,020
areas that I liked the best so I'm going

19
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:26,130
to talk a little bit give you a little

20
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,229
bit of an introduction to the matter of

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,720
machine learning in case you don't know

22
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,570
much about it it'll be quite simple

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,150
there not too much detail and then we'll

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,949
look into a couple of examples of things

25
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,899
that have been resolved over the last

26
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,509
few years using machine learning at the

27
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,540
beginning we've talked about one begin

28
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,259
from around ten years ago and I'll talk

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:57,719
about things I did the errors I made and

30
00:01:52,259 --> 00:02:00,509
the lessons that I learned sometimes in

31
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,449
talks that type-c people go to the

32
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,759
actual final solution and not about the

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,200
process and not talking about oh I tried

34
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,820
this and it didn't work I tried this and

35
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,690
it didn't work

36
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:13,519
and I think that actual process is very

37
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,579
important and that's part of the

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,010
objective of this talk this morning

39
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,650
so things that I've learned over the

40
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:27,170
years a few tricks a few pieces of

41
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:29,180
advice so that at some point if you come

42
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,280
across the same kind of issue in the

43
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:39,800
future then you have some indications of

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:42,170
where to go I'm going to give you a

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:47,690
couple of cases so sorry so mentioned

46
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:49,280
introduce a couple of cases and when we

47
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,070
get into the details I'll let you know a

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,530
bit more about that

49
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:56,209
so also some lessons learnt over time

50
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:00,950
and then we'll have the questions at the

51
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:02,239
end so this question of machine learning

52
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,458
how many of you are familiar with the

53
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,840
machine learning a few people a few

54
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:12,380
people here yeah basically machine

55
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:17,690
learning is a series of techniques that

56
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:23,600
we use in order to try and make a

57
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:26,660
machine learn that is you have a model

58
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:30,440
with which you work and you model a

59
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:34,209
series of entries and then the system

60
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:39,070
goes into questions over classification

61
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:42,410
and it is able to automatically classify

62
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:46,640
different inputs based on what you've

63
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:50,840
told the machine previously there are a

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,690
few people working in this field and if

65
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,540
in machine learning are a few people and

66
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,630
in cybersecurity there are a few people

67
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,359
who are interested in this field and

68
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,370
actual fact I was

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,770
I like to something that somebody said

70
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,210
to me a few years ago somebody said that

71
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,280
if you've got the skills for

72
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,810
cybersecurity and their skills for

73
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:20,060
machine learning you're kind of like a

74
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:25,460
unicorn so data science and machine

75
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:28,460
learning has had a big impetus because

76
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,409
we can process much more data now the

77
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,930
machines we had previously did work but

78
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:36,530
there were issues that we had because we

79
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:39,230
didn't have the power the ability at the

80
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:43,059
time and our computers do have that

81
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:45,380
ability this has grown immensely in

82
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,480
Silicon Valley they are being used for

83
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:51,770
the areas that they need and now it's

84
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,950
extending everywhere so in terms of

85
00:04:51,770 --> 00:05:02,150
cybersecurity it hasn't been used for so

86
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:05,810
many many years in fact I think in terms

87
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,570
of cybersecurity companies I would say

88
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:13,210
it's in the antivirus field that

89
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,210
companies are using this the best

90
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,930
so there are continually more and more

91
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,870
variants of different viruses and

92
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,450
different types of malware and so it's

93
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,210
impossible for companies to have a group

94
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,940
of people analyzing that all the time

95
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,739
because this scale of the malware that

96
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,780
is being generated and everything that

97
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:42,350
needs to be a list is is impossible with

98
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:45,049
a team of people so the kinds of

99
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:48,560
companies in cybersecurity that have

100
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:51,350
invested most and best the ones that

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:06:01,780
have been done most in investing in this

102
00:05:51,350 --> 00:06:06,350
field are the areas of the fields that

103
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,500
where this has many benefits is in the

104
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,789
area of the SOC s

105
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,559
because there are a number of a world

106
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,558
there were a number of alerts

107
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:18,949
and some rules that would give you a

108
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:21,409
number of bullets and manually people

109
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:23,659
would eliminate different alerts

110
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:28,609
different alarms and so this is an

111
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:31,389
attack this is not so let's say that was

112
00:06:28,609 --> 00:06:34,698
a thousand person connecting a day

113
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:37,549
nowadays it's millions of people so at

114
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,729
that's gay it's impossible to do that

115
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:46,248
task manually to see if there was really

116
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:50,299
an attack or not so this is one of the

117
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:54,409
most direct uses that we can find in the

118
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:56,899
field of cyber security but it can also

119
00:06:54,409 --> 00:07:00,379
be used in many many more I've brought

120
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:03,049
along an example today because most lace

121
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,869
is being you so defensive purses for

122
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:09,828
detecting malware but it's also being

123
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:15,499
used in other areas of more offensive

124
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:20,179
matters this is one example that came up

125
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:22,159
in death corn it's a conference that's

126
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:24,469
done in Las Vegas and there's a

127
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:28,729
competition and there are groups of

128
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:30,558
people who attempt to work amongst

129
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:34,039
themselves and they have to defend a

130
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:36,499
number of first servers and they have to

131
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,389
take their own vulnerabilities and stop

132
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,489
other groups attacking them and

133
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:45,379
exploiting them and they have to do the

134
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:47,239
same with the other groups so the more

135
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:53,569
service that you win the more points you

136
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:56,239
win so there was a challenge that was

137
00:07:53,569 --> 00:08:00,919
set up within this area and this was a

138
00:07:56,239 --> 00:08:02,659
few years ago now and in that was a

139
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,938
similar competition as this was done by

140
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:06,558
machines in this particular case so the

141
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:09,079
machines were looking for the failures

142
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:11,119
and exploiting them and her giving

143
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:15,139
they're setting up their patches and so

144
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:18,199
on so there were people had designed the

145
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:21,110
different systems and they were the one

146
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,540
that arranging the the competition it

147
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,100
was the

148
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:30,180
gene that was actually involved in the

149
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:32,700
competition not people so over time I

150
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,049
first seen that machine learning has

151
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:39,840
become a buzzword everybody is talking

152
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:45,689
about machine learning so it's

153
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:47,880
everywhere now so if product doesn't

154
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,740
have next-generation and it doesn't have

155
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,740
machine learning then it's worth nothing

156
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:59,040
we will also see a little bit later on

157
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:03,380
that machine is has a great deal of

158
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:07,199
power but it's not useful for everything

159
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:13,350
these are some actual sentences that

160
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:15,780
I've come across talking to people and

161
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,360
we're talking about how let's put rules

162
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:21,209
for machine learning detection in and

163
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,370
the response to this would be you don't

164
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,080
have to stick any rules in machine

165
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,480
learning the machine has to tell you

166
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,730
what the rules are if you give the

167
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:34,680
Machine the rules that's not learning

168
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:36,540
it's doing what you've told it to do the

169
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,089
products they say oh this has got

170
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,980
machine learning but in fact the machine

171
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:46,500
learning that it's got doesn't work at

172
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:53,450
all and it's just given a different

173
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:56,400
weight but actually the result is the

174
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,080
powering that that they've put in they

175
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,590
say that says machine learning but it's

176
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,890
not actually being put into use or in

177
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,720
some cases just for using the point of

178
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:10,770
using machine learning they're just use

179
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,440
just a few characters and actually the

180
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,510
power of machine learning is taking a

181
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,330
lot of characteristics and that's the

182
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,830
power and the potential of machine

183
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,290
learning and that's something that we

184
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:25,800
can't process if there are just a few

185
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:27,030
parameters then we can set up the rule

186
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,839
for ourselves we don't know the machine

187
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,839
to do that for us

188
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,200
during this time when I've seen these

189
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,520
things I have been a little bit

190
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,370
suspicious of that people say oh this is

191
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:46,110
this has a machine-learning but in fact

192
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,110
it's not actually being used that well

193
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,880
so I'm just going to give you a little

194
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:01,089
bit of an explanation of this and I'm

195
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,180
going to give you an example to see to

196
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:09,279
show you how machine learning works in

197
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:13,599
the industry and then we'll continue so

198
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:16,120
I just chose a person at random so you

199
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,410
do know who this person is mmm perhaps

200
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:24,339
you do yes I should imagine how does our

201
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:27,550
brain work I show you these photos and

202
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:30,820
you've seen images of this person many

203
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,459
many times so your brain is already

204
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:37,000
familiar with him and it's got an idea

205
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:44,770
of who this person is who this person is

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:48,310
what this person is like the world of

207
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:50,890
retina and the world of intelligence is

208
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,949
about perception and we perceive the

209
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,439
world in images and we create an idea in

210
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,440
our brain of who this person is and once

211
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,110
we have the idea when we get new images

212
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,730
of that person we apply that idea that

213
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:08,529
we have and to see if it fits or not so

214
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,950
is this the same person that showed you

215
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:13,930
before no it isn't you know it isn't

216
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,450
because it doesn't fit the model that

217
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,329
you've got in your brain is this the

218
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:23,700
same person well kind of looks similar

219
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:26,709
but you know it's the same person

220
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:32,050
because your brain doesn't always just

221
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:34,089
retain the images it's also about it's

222
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,449
not just about memorizing things that

223
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,450
you see

224
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:44,439
it's about using that information I'm

225
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:47,079
not quite sure how to explain it to you

226
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,699
but it's about taking new data and using

227
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:55,239
that it in saying that this is similar

228
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:57,939
so machine learning in fact is all about

229
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:02,709
using this model that we have in the

230
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:09,430
middle here this function and it says

231
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:10,628
does this belong to this or not and here

232
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,359
we have the same model in a little bit

233
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:18,579
more of a formal manner we have

234
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,529
different types of models here and when

235
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:24,878
are they used these are the models that

236
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:30,699
we have in to construct the idea of a

237
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:33,220
piece of data so based on the data that

238
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:36,310
we're giving the process for machine

239
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:41,439
learning is to extract characteristics

240
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:43,508
and process the data we'll see some

241
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:46,300
cases now in cases from which I've made

242
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:48,269
mistakes so the data has to be prepared

243
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:55,229
for the model that we're going to use

244
00:13:48,269 --> 00:14:00,610
and then we use the model in most models

245
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:03,819
what we do is we obtain a candidate

246
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:06,939
model it's calculated how good or bad

247
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:09,880
that is and modifications are made and

248
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:15,579
tell the model adapts well to the data

249
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:21,459
that we have this is a little example of

250
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:22,899
the ways in which this can be done so

251
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:24,609
we're trying to get a model that would

252
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:30,220
adjust to the the data that you have on

253
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:31,389
the right and if the model is going to

254
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,230
be aligned it's got a couple of

255
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:38,319
parameters we sent them in at random and

256
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,329
we calculate the error using that model

257
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:43,269
which is rather big at first and then we

258
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:45,339
go adjusting the parameters so that with

259
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,649
every adjustment the model that we

260
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:51,410
interpret is better than the last one

261
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:56,400
until it's good enough

262
00:14:51,410 --> 00:15:01,439
after several tries we haven't improved

263
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:03,390
much then we stopped so we have a line

264
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,930
in this particular case which are just

265
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:09,420
to the data that we have we don't need

266
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:12,510
all the data we don't need all the

267
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:21,360
photos of the person in our mind in

268
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:23,790
order to know who that person is in

269
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,190
machine learning there are two different

270
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,969
types on the right

271
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:33,750
it's a regression so it's a model that

272
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:38,250
basically adjusts to some data it's a

273
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:41,010
prediction of data and the other one is

274
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:46,800
what we find in cybersecurity and it's a

275
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:49,500
classification it's all about having

276
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,170
data of two different kinds and I want

277
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,120
to find a way of the system saying what

278
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,860
this is of one type and this is of

279
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:02,190
another type this is my way and this is

280
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:04,980
not this is an attack and this is not so

281
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:09,600
let's go on to the first example this is

282
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:12,030
from 10 years ago but I'm going to tell

283
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,620
you all about the different steps if you

284
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,689
know a little bit about with machine

285
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,490
learning then you'll see it and you'll

286
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,620
see that's not going to work and in fact

287
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:22,860
it didn't yes but you'll see how it

288
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,070
improved in the end this was a friend

289
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,690
basically that give me data from the

290
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,960
company was working in that had an

291
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:35,790
intrusion it had seven months of

292
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:38,940
classified alerts and there were 120

293
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:43,280
thousand false attacks that went real

294
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,280
attacks and seven hundred real attacks

295
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:53,730
this is quite standard in these

296
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:57,300
detection systems at the end of the day

297
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,080
the rules attempt to detect something

298
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:05,470
that is not real

299
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:08,740
back then to not detect a real attack so

300
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,930
this is more or less the data a piece of

301
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,060
data that I had is this a text from the

302
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:16,180
alert system from the intrusion alert

303
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:20,470
system and it would attacked certain

304
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:27,570
types of attacks so I removed some of

305
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:27,569
the data that probably would not apply

306
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:35,590
and I ended up with the textual

307
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:43,420
description the IP address and port the

308
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:48,010
time and that was it and I wanted to use

309
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,690
that to try and detect when a an attack

310
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,550
was repeated on many occasions and it

311
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,710
was a false attack if there would be

312
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,840
certain patters if it was coming from a

313
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:59,500
certain IP if it was coming at a certain

314
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,980
time of a inter tool find patterns in

315
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,620
order to match which were the false

316
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:09,400
positives and to determine which were

317
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:14,739
the real attacks so this was more or

318
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:17,710
less so what I had I put in the date and

319
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,380
the IP I put it in in pieces and the

320
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:25,870
classification which was the Arab one if

321
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:32,170
whether it was an attack or not so I

322
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:34,330
used a decision tree the name says was

323
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,270
it what it does but here we have some of

324
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:41,500
the characteristics of a decision tree

325
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,389
we have all of these here so which of

326
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:47,020
these characteristics in the particular

327
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:51,460
case would help me to divide the tree up

328
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:53,920
into different branches if I could

329
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,420
divide the tree up into different two

330
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,860
branches then that would help me to take

331
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:02,970
a decision and it helped me to set

332
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,969
priorities it was built in this way

333
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,629
characteristic was taken and you take a

334
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,840
decision based on that characteristic

335
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:14,130
and a baster and the rest will you build

336
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,129
up the tree in this manner

337
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:23,540
something that I also did was to add in

338
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:27,020
their false negatives you calculate the

339
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:30,620
error so depending on when your problem

340
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,780
is it might be so bad to in this

341
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,050
particular case detect an attack that

342
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:40,790
was not a real attack than to not detect

343
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:43,399
an attack that is a real attack so I

344
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:45,290
wanted to remove the false negatives but

345
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,720
I didn't want to get rid of any of real

346
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:55,399
attacks so when you calculate the cost

347
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:58,480
of how good or bad a model is if the

348
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,260
real attacks that you've got rid of

349
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,510
because you thought the way for sites

350
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:20,810
that's very very bad and that determines

351
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:22,730
the cost how are you going to it's

352
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:25,580
common to just take all the data train

353
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,870
the model and then test it with the same

354
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:33,169
data but that is really useless because

355
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:38,989
in the end if you test the model with

356
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:41,630
data that you have trained necessarily

357
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:45,350
to work well with data it has never seen

358
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:52,670
so these are the ways we use one is to

359
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:55,280
divide the data one to train and and one

360
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:57,410
here on the right which basically what

361
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,770
is us is exactly the same sort of

362
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:05,210
operation but it's only it changes a

363
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:08,300
little bit that it uses to test in the

364
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,370
end it trains with olden data and then

365
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:13,730
it tests with altered it is like having

366
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:16,129
a new window that you move so this is

367
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:19,300
why it's most widely used in academia

368
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,510
for example why is it important because

369
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,930
there is

370
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:27,290
big issue in machine learning which is

371
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:30,410
overfitting which basically happens when

372
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:36,290
your model does not learn but only

373
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:39,410
memorize so you train the model and it's

374
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:42,320
so used to that data to that date

375
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,080
everything that doesn't work with them

376
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,590
you can see the Google learning would be

377
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:51,470
at this curve but if it has it will have

378
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,389
weird things was that memorizing so what

379
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,740
happens when it memorizes that when they

380
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,780
give you something they have never seen

381
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,640
before we do it wrong because you

382
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,350
haven't understood how it works you ever

383
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,040
only memorize basically the way I'm

384
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:12,919
doing is from the data set I have I

385
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:15,580
divided my work data set and my work

386
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:19,700
dataset I'm further divided between

387
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:23,980
training data set and validation data so

388
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,980
I trained the models with training I

389
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:34,490
choose from with the validation data set

390
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:41,570
the model that has worked the best and I

391
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:43,490
use the test data set you will see that

392
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,590
your model is very good here but it's

393
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,560
very bad at you there so when that

394
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,629
happens is because you do not have

395
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:54,490
overfitting your model is it's

396
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:54,490
memorizing nor do your understanding

397
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:07,280
what might you look like trimming

398
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:10,280
techniques to make it smaller and if

399
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,860
this is the way when I tried it when I

400
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:17,379
test it it didn't work properly and why

401
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:20,840
because first of all it made weird

402
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:26,030
decisions best thing about decision

403
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:29,320
trees it's very easy to see the

404
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,320
decisions it's me

405
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:36,670
whether it's making nonsense model was

406
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:40,610
making a decision she classified false

407
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:44,300
positive taken into the last four little

408
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:47,449
bits of the IP that doesn't make sense

409
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:50,060
because to IP that's share the last

410
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:53,690
little bit is only by chance for the nor

411
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:58,190
related to each other now there were

412
00:23:53,690 --> 00:24:02,320
also weird decisions when the inputs

413
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,320
were very different due to the training

414
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:16,870
if with specific data you've only

415
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,870
obtained and you might get bit of data

416
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:23,000
divided by the actual retrieve it might

417
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,730
be very far away but the way in which

418
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:46,310
the tree has divided space it falls into

419
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:50,770
the same classification were talking

420
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:53,870
about a hundred thousand false IDs

421
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:57,230
versus seven hundred alerts and those

422
00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:00,500
very unbalanced so with unbalanced data

423
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:03,500
types then we find all data sets and we

424
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:07,070
find issues but that is very common in

425
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:10,370
cybersecurity having data sets because

426
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:13,790
we have many false positives not many

427
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:16,010
attacks and although we have loads of

428
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,530
malware there's also no binary switch

429
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:22,010
aren't good and are being generated why

430
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:24,560
did was right I'm going to think about

431
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:26,740
all the fields in which these issues

432
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:31,610
have been sold and so I thought about

433
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:33,500
nuclear how much data do you think we

434
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,520
have from nuclear plants who says many

435
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,720
losses

436
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,350
it'll few

437
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:48,250
whew right because nuclear plants do not

438
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:52,269
explode very often thankfully they do in

439
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:55,990
order to know when nuclear plant is

440
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:58,269
going to have a failure well what they

441
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,129
do is because they do not have data when

442
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:02,139
it fails but they do have data when it

443
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:06,070
works probably what they do is they use

444
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:09,070
one class model as their name says they

445
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,080
only have one class of model so the ones

446
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,529
that we do not have things are about we

447
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:17,529
know and so we only modernize those data

448
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:19,450
that we know and in this case is

449
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:21,730
everything that works so everything if

450
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,139
it's not that then I'm going to say it's

451
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,960
fact if it's going to be the other type

452
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:29,080
and that's why I did so I got rid of

453
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,940
real attacks not not really got rid of

454
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:35,439
them but I just put them on the test

455
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,419
data set to see how they were classified

456
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:45,639
but I didn't use a member for the

457
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:49,059
training try one was a support vector

458
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:53,799
machine which is basically tries to find

459
00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:58,210
a high which is a pan in n dimensions

460
00:26:53,799 --> 00:27:01,360
and separates the two different types of

461
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:06,940
data kikianus that you aren't trying to

462
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:10,360
classify right now I don't have to so

463
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:14,860
what I did was to use a variation that

464
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:18,789
uses a hypersphere so the hypersphere

465
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:23,399
what it does is I have a formula and I'm

466
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:27,580
going to minimize radio so I'm going

467
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:29,469
hypersphere all my data with a minimum

468
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,570
radius because obviously I could use a

469
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:35,259
bigger one but what I want to do is to

470
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:39,490
adjust it and everything that's out of

471
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:41,379
that hyper sphere for me everything

472
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,269
that's inside is the false positives the

473
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:45,039
things that I know that are false

474
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:48,710
positives and everything that's outside

475
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:52,620
it will be real attacks

476
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:55,230
and wasn't fake I'm going to mention

477
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:58,320
because you will see it yes sometimes in

478
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:01,080
the hive you will see sometimes it you

479
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,960
cannot separate your data whether with a

480
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,379
plan with with a line with a hyper plan

481
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,900
what do i do then well we do in sequence

482
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,940
form the space you will see later wanna

483
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,260
show you they said that I'm going to

484
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,280
write the our view scan or a

485
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:19,500
transformation actually write several

486
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:23,120
models in transformations and the one

487
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,380
the work the best but in this case

488
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,510
transformations you can see problem you

489
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:32,330
see all the data you cannot divide them

490
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:32,330
with a plan you can transform the space

491
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:40,709
dividing with a plan according to the

492
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,460
data you have you will have to transform

493
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:48,300
the space in one way or another

494
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:49,980
now the other just to show you one which

495
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:56,370
is more traditional

496
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:58,890
because now nowadays than or even but

497
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:02,280
some 10 years ago there were quite

498
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:10,230
trendy so why did is that I took this

499
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:13,260
and I compared it with mixture of

500
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,450
gorgeous you know how Goshen works I

501
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,879
have data and I can have it in many

502
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:21,840
dimensions and what I'm going to do is

503
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,120
I'm going to start adding those warships

504
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,929
and I'm going to find a model for that

505
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,520
data if it's a very simple model then I

506
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,180
will only needs one but if it's more

507
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,740
complex

508
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:37,680
I might need 100 all but in the end by

509
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:41,370
doing mixture mixtures of course you

510
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:45,450
could actually model the data that you

511
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:47,520
have and finally what I did once I

512
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,160
already knew I would use those two

513
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,220
models because I was going to use only

514
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,260
the false positives then I wanted to

515
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,570
start working a bit more with data

516
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:02,129
because important I realize

517
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:04,950
is that preparing the data is where you

518
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:08,640
find the best results if you invest in

519
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:12,840
doing a proper data engineering it is

520
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:21,810
more important than finding so basically

521
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:24,209
what I did with IPS was - it doesn't

522
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:26,550
make sense to only use the last bit so

523
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:29,490
what I did was use the vessel first and

524
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:31,710
second first second and third base so

525
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:35,730
that it understood that it was sub

526
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:40,440
Network and then I did another thing and

527
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:44,250
I'm going to these threes IPs these

528
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,260
three IPS which ones do you think of

529
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:50,850
more similar if you were the model and

530
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:52,950
you had to classify I piece which one

531
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,120
would you say is more similar to each

532
00:30:52,950 --> 00:31:02,040
other and now if I show you this now

533
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:04,379
which ones are more similar if during an

534
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,420
attack which two you would think are

535
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:11,190
more related the second one and the

536
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:17,130
third one and why because it comes from

537
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:20,610
the same information we have not fed

538
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,900
into did not feed this information model

539
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:25,979
then the model will not be able to make

540
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:28,350
decisions based so when we give data or

541
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:30,330
information will we feed data into a

542
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:33,510
model we have to extract some of that

543
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:35,939
data as much information as we can and

544
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:39,360
then if the model decides or determines

545
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,400
is not important then there are other

546
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,669
techniques that we can use in order to

547
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,710
get rid of the features that we did not

548
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,030
give this very first place to the model

549
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,860
then the model will never know if it's

550
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:53,730
exists it doesn't now but another

551
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:56,189
question how about these IPS which to

552
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,640
you think are more similar I'm waiting

553
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:06,980
for you to say show me the flags right

554
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:08,450
well there you go now see you would

555
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,730
associate

556
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:16,340
similar origin for example the ones from

557
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:17,029
Asia why because geographically they're

558
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,999
close

559
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:26,590
well there is something that we need to

560
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:26,590
because this is not we have in some way

561
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:36,949
the model understands for casino because

562
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:43,459
we only use a category categorical

563
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:45,470
variables Spain Germany country the

564
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:54,200
model will not have a way of knowing

565
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:57,259
that Spain and Portugal and the United

566
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,919
States and China and the United States

567
00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:04,249
China we know because our brain gets

568
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:06,409
more danger we take the metadata from

569
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:12,950
the information but the model won't know

570
00:33:06,409 --> 00:33:14,929
so we have to feed it to be able to do

571
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,899
this then we have to find my

572
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:20,960
representation for the data the model

573
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:25,008
knows what to do so I did in this case

574
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,379
for example was because I didn't really

575
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:29,779
trust here localization in terms of

576
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:33,459
cities but I did trust it in terms of

577
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:36,950
countries what I did was to get the

578
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:41,749
cities in a certain country it's called

579
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:44,179
in it and there are many things things

580
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:46,429
that are close to each other but for

581
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,409
example in this data representation this

582
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:50,960
is not going to be applicable but in any

583
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:52,789
case I decided not to try this yes

584
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,369
rather than making it more complex and

585
00:33:52,789 --> 00:34:01,249
they actually worked pretty well so now

586
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:05,859
this is the example with days which is

587
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:05,859
very similar and at the end of the day

588
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,540
the model but you can say what day of

589
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:13,969
the week it is or if it's a bank holiday

590
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:16,579
you can have a pattern but if you're not

591
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:18,230
telling your model today or tomorrow is

592
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:19,920
a bank holiday then it's not going to be

593
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:24,230
able to find that pattern

594
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:27,090
mother nobody's tambien you will also

595
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:31,830
see that in the cases that we're going

596
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:37,350
to see because there's only one class we

597
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:40,110
had to find rejection which is basically

598
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:44,610
taking into account all the tastes that

599
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:48,150
I have how many can be outside of the

600
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:50,220
sphere or of the persons how many can I

601
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:52,950
have outside because if I can or

602
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:55,500
hannover even one outside then these

603
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:57,839
Spears might be too big or the goalies

604
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,960
may be too big and then they might be

605
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,360
taking data line so I applied different

606
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,720
values for this as well to see which one

607
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:09,060
works better and we've had in the end

608
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,600
was something like were you seeing on

609
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,600
the screen now you can see the number of

610
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:25,410
courses here and then you can see the

611
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:27,120
rejection threshold you can see which

612
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:33,149
one do you think is best which one would

613
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:39,630
you choose any one the third one that

614
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:44,460
fit all this one 98.9 why okay it's it's

615
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:47,520
more yeah sweet but no because it's true

616
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:51,960
that it is more I have a little bit

617
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:55,470
because I haven't explained false

618
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,620
negative always bear in mind when you

619
00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:01,890
study but you have to keep the problem

620
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:04,589
in mind all the time because if I define

621
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:09,900
a model that says is this an attack and

622
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:11,520
it always says having one hundred one

623
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,580
hundred and twenty thousand positives

624
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,310
and seven hundred real attack saying

625
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:21,990
always but it's not I will always get a

626
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:25,049
99% accuracy so I am very accurate I

627
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,549
have to take into account the index of a

628
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:30,150
false negative

629
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:33,480
amount of times but I have noted a real

630
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:36,300
attack so in this case to this problem

631
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,750
guys date said it's important accuracy

632
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,940
it's absolutely safe because in the end

633
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,730
when you wanted to really make sure you

634
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:49,020
do not miss any real attack if you

635
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:51,090
filter the 70% of positives that is

636
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,670
already a good result you should need to

637
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,590
reach 90 something percent but what's

638
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,500
really important is to not lose any of

639
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:00,720
the real attack so what we want is

640
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:03,390
taking all this into account getting the

641
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,209
minimum false negatives of the highest

642
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:19,200
accuracy so the best ones would actually

643
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:21,870
be this one and this one in the end

644
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,790
taking into account the mixture of

645
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:28,950
gaussians and the one class and you will

646
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,660
see that master sees in here because I

647
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,750
use different kind of a different data

648
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:37,319
set and it will always work better with

649
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:58,410
data said it's been trained with them of

650
00:37:37,320 --> 00:38:00,870
course their owner I have been allowed

651
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:06,180
to learn in the data set but my company

652
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:09,240
will not allow to be precise which would

653
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,339
give me data and then we polish them

654
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:15,180
blue in the end because it didn't happen

655
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,830
I decided to give up on it and do

656
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,839
something else because you can use this

657
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:23,310
internally if you have a company you can

658
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:25,800
use something similar for companies to

659
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:31,710
lend you the data set of the attacks

660
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:33,150
thing again you can publish them which

661
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,370
you need by the way because otherwise

662
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:38,070
they will not be published

663
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,359
then it is really difficult so it's

664
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:43,080
something that you can use intently but

665
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,390
not publish so for me it was anyway so

666
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:50,279
out we're going now onto the second

667
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:52,290
issue way I said well first of all I'm

668
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,480
going to check where I have public data

669
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:55,950
set and then I'll run the experiment

670
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,500
because I don't want to be disappointed

671
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:07,080
again anything about malware analysis a

672
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:13,980
little bit but just to simplify you have

673
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:19,830
two ways static and dynamic static is

674
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:23,070
equivalent to getting it but you can not

675
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:27,870
start the car you can do whatever you

676
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:31,160
want but you cannot start the car means

677
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:33,980
you start it and you go third Drive

678
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,589
these could be the two types of

679
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,700
depending on which analysis you do on

680
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:44,790
the way all the way you're approaching

681
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:47,580
it you will use different kinds look at

682
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:55,080
the binary without executing it or you

683
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:56,520
can remember an executed and because

684
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,090
most of them are that we have nowadays

685
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,500
connects from somewhere or to somewhere

686
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:05,070
in order to do something and it's

687
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:09,150
usually using domain so they use the

688
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:13,740
technique known as deep what they did

689
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:16,170
was to use a domain name and when those

690
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,020
domains were detected and they went onto

691
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,420
a blacklist into the malware could not

692
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:25,140
connect any Morrison what malware have

693
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:29,520
done is not use domain names but

694
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:31,740
basically generate domains where the

695
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,070
seed and a terminus

696
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:37,490
and if you block this malware then it's

697
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:40,680
going to connect to different domain

698
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:43,040
which I know and so that makes it more

699
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,440
difficult because now now now where

700
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,119
analysis when they face malware uses

701
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,040
this technique they have to get into the

702
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,320
algorithm the use of certain techniques

703
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,810
they have to locate it so that they can

704
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,290
block it and block all of those attempts

705
00:40:54,810 --> 00:41:00,540
so I wanted to try this issue to see if

706
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:06,630
I could detect all these names because

707
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:15,119
yeah weird names easily see this is not

708
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:19,619
a normal domain name ethos so I took

709
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:26,849
data from elixir they have it has a good

710
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:35,460
data and then I used a information from

711
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:38,900
jihad dude hub and then I had a number

712
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:43,580
of examples and codes that had been

713
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:47,630
taken from these algorithms and I

714
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:52,369
generated many many different names and

715
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,369
families as much as the many as I needed

716
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:59,940
was some work that had been done using

717
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:04,170
this and I'll explain this a little bit

718
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:08,280
later on and it's by somebody who so

719
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:11,160
name is Duluth and extracting from that

720
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,070
day name there would be a number of

721
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,950
different characters number of digits

722
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:19,500
and the domain name links and all

723
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:24,589
different kinds of information from the

724
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:27,660
domain name itself and then a number of

725
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:31,799
bits of data regarding the traffic the

726
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,509
DNS traffic and this information that

727
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,119
I'm showing here was sort of used to me

728
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:38,510
but not the other information because

729
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:40,340
had the domain names but I wasn't

730
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:45,500
capturing

731
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:47,840
all that information and also there were

732
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:52,280
families that weren't working anymore so

733
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,800
I couldn't obtain that Dana data so I

734
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,340
said what about using this data that is

735
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,930
useful and adding some extra things

736
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:03,590
would I be able to achieve such a good

737
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:05,839
classification as this person because if

738
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:07,520
a family of malware has is no longer

739
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:12,740
being used because it can't obtain that

740
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:15,200
data anymore so in the end the amount of

741
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:21,979
data that you have for training the

742
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:26,600
pattern width is reduced so one of the

743
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:29,210
things I end up with was engrams so if

744
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:34,180
we have a wind with two elements and you

745
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:34,180
move them along so you have this named

746
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:43,090
FA and then C II then Bo and then you

747
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:46,340
would move them along across the windows

748
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:53,720
some would be only letters other would

749
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:58,220
be pairs so if you look here then you

750
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:03,859
will see there was variations and mean

751
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:07,879
ratio and they were using them grams

752
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:10,760
just as they were so the number of

753
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:14,870
characteristics that you end up with is

754
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,790
absolutely huge and this makes it

755
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:19,720
impossible to use or makes it very very

756
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:25,100
difficult to use using normal hardware

757
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:30,290
so that's why I used two distinct and I

758
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:35,049
tried something and instead of using the

759
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:37,910
full alphabet I used it in a masked way

760
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:44,030
so there were just some letters and

761
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:46,970
symbols so generate a name based on the

762
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:49,450
one above and use the engrams using this

763
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,450
transformation

764
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:57,920
so this retains part of them for me

765
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:59,989
consonant consonant vowel and so on and

766
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,960
this information could be useful in the

767
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:04,579
end and the number of characteristics

768
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,930
that are required and much less than

769
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:12,499
what we saw before I used a random

770
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:18,140
forest for this the same as Duluth had

771
00:45:12,499 --> 00:45:20,660
used but the characteristics that were

772
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:24,650
used would not the best of all of them

773
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:26,450
but they were cut in two sets and that's

774
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:30,380
why it's called random because they're

775
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:35,180
not all the same and then we have a

776
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:37,579
voting system so if I have hundred trees

777
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:41,169
and ninety-eight say these are the same

778
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:44,420
then I'll go with the ninety-eight and

779
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:49,309
this is more or less what I had in terms

780
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:56,779
of results and you saying one two and

781
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:59,809
three sized ngrams so I was doing this

782
00:45:56,779 --> 00:46:01,849
in in parts in this case one two three

783
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:04,009
and four somewhere of two somewhere of

784
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:06,289
three from before some of just one and I

785
00:46:04,009 --> 00:46:15,279
was getting good results and to do that

786
00:46:06,289 --> 00:46:18,619
I was using a brute and so just get

787
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:21,469
random data and put them in the random

788
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:23,779
forest just like the others and one of

789
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:26,150
the characteristics of random forests is

790
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:30,739
that you can determine the importance of

791
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:33,469
a characteristic so giving the

792
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:34,819
importance of the day to the red points

793
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:37,369
that you can see here are the random

794
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:39,200
ones so you can see which bits of the

795
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:40,489
data that you've put into the model are

796
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,019
the good ones

797
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:46,369
which ones which have been useful and

798
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:47,808
which have not so you can see these here

799
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:51,049
down the bottom are not very useful

800
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:55,849
there are almost as say useful as the

801
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:57,739
random ones that I've put in but under

802
00:46:55,849 --> 00:47:00,380
the hand there are some other

803
00:46:57,739 --> 00:47:04,519
characteristics that are more important

804
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:05,630
and so I just said determined to use the

805
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:12,680
ones that had come out

806
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:15,380
best with the top 25 20 and 15 so I had

807
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,620
15 characteristics with 15 that you see

808
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:23,770
here and I had quite good level of

809
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:27,650
detection with that so out of the 15

810
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:30,140
there were 9 of the characteristics that

811
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:36,200
I had put in as additional 1 so what I

812
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:39,950
had added in was useful so you have a

813
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:43,879
little example of this here an example

814
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:50,330
of the characteristics for the examples

815
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:51,440
of using a random name and obviously as

816
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:57,259
you can see the results are quite

817
00:47:51,440 --> 00:48:02,440
different I'd like to show you something

818
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:07,610
now I'm not going to to show you the

819
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:09,470
training session because it take about

820
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:15,350
an hour in this particular case and we

821
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:18,379
don't have it now we're here so I have

822
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:23,540
saved the model once it had been trained

823
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:27,010
and used and I'm going to use this to

824
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,009
show you a classification

825
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:46,850
so have a little think because I've got

826
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:49,970
a list of names that we can use so this

827
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:55,250
is what comes up after its put in being

828
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:57,410
put into use and I've got lists here

829
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:59,900
with names that I've invented anybody

830
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:06,190
here would like to add something to see

831
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:06,190
what the model comes up with what's that

832
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:17,470
okay so that's photo goat cheese yes

833
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,470
welcome

834
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:36,489
just give me a second

835
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:50,759
I couldn't find the model at the time

836
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:53,760
okay now we have it this is what it

837
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:59,099
comes up with once it's being used this

838
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:00,930
is how it classifies the information so

839
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:12,920
this is the classification that comes up

840
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:12,919
with its way but generated with the DGA

841
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:20,810
this with DGA so probably if it's not DJ

842
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:20,810
then it wouldn't attacked it

843
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:46,339
let's try chat loons dot AO t is that

844
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:51,329
right oh no it comes back as clean

845
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:54,930
because I've used D XI a algorithm so

846
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:58,710
that's what it detects so this doesn't

847
00:50:54,930 --> 00:51:00,480
have a strange form to see to know if a

848
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:05,640
normal names got Malware then you'd need

849
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:10,200
to do other things to it so this model

850
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:12,420
has been trained to detect that manner

851
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,890
of constructing using an algorithm so

852
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,890
it's not going to come up with that one

853
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,500
[Music]

854
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:29,310
in my pub and in docker hub you've got

855
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,650
this information it's here in a docker

856
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:35,970
he'd got a docker pool and you can

857
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:39,390
download that you've got the data we

858
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:41,660
have got internet connection the data is

859
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:48,180
available to him so you can access that

860
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:49,500
no problem so let's just go to the

861
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:52,560
lessons learnt in the time that we've

862
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:55,829
got left here today what did I learn I

863
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,180
learned about keeping focused on the

864
00:51:55,829 --> 00:52:01,369
problem in

865
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:04,109
and you have to focus on the issue and

866
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:05,940
perhaps the result is they only get 70

867
00:52:04,109 --> 00:52:07,440
percent result perhaps the 70 percent

868
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,089
result is good for the issue that you

869
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,829
have perhaps is better than what you've

870
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:15,690
got now you have to concentrate on the

871
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:18,859
issue that you're trying to resolve and

872
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:24,210
secondly spend time doing feature

873
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:27,089
extraction if we only get extract two or

874
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:29,400
three little bits and pieces and we

875
00:52:27,089 --> 00:52:31,950
intoxicate it with what we think it

876
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,609
should be coming up with but if we put

877
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:37,529
the blinkers on it will only end up

878
00:52:35,609 --> 00:52:39,770
giving us what we want it to give us so

879
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:41,640
we're not making the most of the model

880
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:45,420
we're not making most of their

881
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:48,089
techniques for their model to tell us

882
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:50,700
and to give us some patterns that we are

883
00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:51,990
unable to to deal with because they've

884
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:56,669
got different characteristics

885
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:59,759
I love machine learning it's very

886
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:04,170
powerful tool but I don't think it's the

887
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,760
solution to everything in this

888
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:07,770
particular case if you only had to use

889
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,410
these four characteristics then that

890
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:12,960
will work much better there's just a few

891
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:16,500
characteristics then you can end up with

892
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,210
the pattern so instead of getting into

893
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,339
machine unioning here which would not

894
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:22,589
make any sense we have to know when to

895
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:26,220
use it or when to use it there are

896
00:53:22,589 --> 00:53:28,849
always different solutions and machine

897
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:31,770
learning is not always the best solution

898
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:35,390
you need to prepare your data carefully

899
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,390
for the model that you're going to use

900
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:41,520
you get the country the coordinates for

901
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:44,309
example all of this data helps the model

902
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,349
you have to leave it prepared so the

903
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:52,109
model can use the donator correctly

904
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:56,190
inappropriately try and keep things

905
00:53:52,109 --> 00:54:00,029
simple in the first example that I gave

906
00:53:56,190 --> 00:54:01,410
you it was more complex than the some of

907
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:04,760
the Gaussian so though the some of the

908
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,759
gaussians worked very well

909
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:12,040
some people only have a neuronal network

910
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,170
and they get the solution straight well

911
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,660
but this can be very complex and they

912
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:19,090
have it other types of issues so maybe

913
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:20,910
other simpler solutions that will give

914
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:24,100
you the results that you're looking for

915
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:36,490
don't get frustrated how many dogs can

916
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:45,339
you see in that picture horse baby so

917
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:46,959
what I mean is don't get frustrated we

918
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,760
put in the information before the names

919
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,510
in for the name of my company comes up

920
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:53,830
with as a malware result so there are

921
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:56,110
different different layers and your

922
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:58,509
model doesn't have to solve everything

923
00:54:56,110 --> 00:55:02,430
don't get angry even though you don't

924
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:02,430
like the results of the machine learning

925
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:08,140
sometimes people get angry with the

926
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:13,810
result that they get and that's not

927
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:16,509
necessary so that's everything for today

928
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:19,680
if nessuno buddies got a question for me

929
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:19,680
thank you all very much

930
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:28,200
[Applause]

931
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:28,200
you
