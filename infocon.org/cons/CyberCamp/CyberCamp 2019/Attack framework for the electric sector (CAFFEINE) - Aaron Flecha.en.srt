2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:16,259
thank you very much for coming and I

3
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:18,570
will also like to thank cyber camp

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,359
organization for having me here another

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:27,590
year I hope you will enjoy this

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,760
presentation I would like to tell you

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:35,910
what we're going to see in this

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:39,750
presentation I don't know if you are all

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,209
related to the initial sector or the

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,620
electric sector but we're going to see

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,600
assets communications and some

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,059
regulation that effects this sector and

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,100
can make us understand better how the

14
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,099
project developed

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,718
we're going to see the electric sector

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,619
we're going to know what attack taxonomy

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,640
is and how to incorporate procedures and

18
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,619
techniques I think there have been some

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,280
presentations on this topic so I can

20
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,549
help you understand them better we are

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,580
going to talk about the caffeine

22
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:24,360
framework what it or what it is and how

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:28,729
to use it at the industry level and

24
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:33,740
we're going to see a threat modeling

25
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:39,060
taking into account all the information

26
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:43,130
this is who I am today interest has

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,560
already introduced me here you have my

28
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:51,390
LinkedIn account and I will be glad to

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:58,369
answer any questions you may send me to

30
00:01:51,390 --> 00:02:01,079
start with the project is the result of

31
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,490
master's degree final thesis

32
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,820
whose name is

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:10,478
stage framework of attack for the

34
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,569
electric sector in the name doesn't

35
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:17,650
match the framework but we will see why

36
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:20,859
afterwards this framework was the result

37
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:25,200
of a need of certain sectors such as the

38
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:30,450
electric sectors to have our regulation

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:34,720
also from tasks from Red Team tasks and

40
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:40,709
attacks modeling the last attacks that

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:44,890
have affected more the industrial sector

42
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:48,640
we're aimed at the electric sector so it

43
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:54,208
is an a strategic sector and it can also

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:59,260
affect the scooters electric cars and

45
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:03,239
devices which work with certain

46
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,239
batteries and that can be a problem

47
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:13,660
another reason why I chose to carry out

48
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:19,420
this project was due to the fever EU

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:23,430
framework weed has to be complied with

50
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,429
in the financial sector

51
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:32,370
it is a set of rules for Red Team

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,209
applications how to interact with

53
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:41,620
financial environment some sectors

54
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:46,180
require very strict regulations so you

55
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:50,290
cannot carry out some testing testing

56
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:53,049
has to be agreed on with the client this

57
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:58,239
happens in several sectors such as the

58
00:03:53,049 --> 00:04:02,230
electric sector another reason to use

59
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,769
the energy sector especially the

60
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:08,518
electric sector is the high number of

61
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:16,470
attacks that have been detected

62
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:20,298
there are several files based basically

63
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:28,490
that some companies are investing on

64
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:32,580
development some experts on the subject

65
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:37,760
can do some research on vulnerabilities

66
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,909
that affect devices located in electric

67
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,390
substations

68
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,690
or in one of the stages of the energy

69
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,909
supply we're going to see some of these

70
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,730
devices you know the video to understand

71
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,670
better what I'm talking about in order

72
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:57,600
to place us into context there are

73
00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:01,470
several parts in the electric sector we

74
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,310
have the electric power plant which

75
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:11,060
generate electricity coming from wine

76
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:15,360
mills dams and so on and then there is

77
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:18,600
second stage of transportation in all

78
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,669
the to convey electricity to strategic

79
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:28,110
points then we have a substation some of

80
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:31,680
them also have transformer you know the

81
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,350
to supply energy to the customers and

82
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,300
then we have this substation of

83
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,540
distribution which is the one we are

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:44,280
going to focus on finally we have the a

85
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:48,380
market in stage the one we are more

86
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:51,659
familiar with as consumers we have smart

87
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:55,530
counters and meters and all the devices

88
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:58,680
that carry out measurement so what's the

89
00:05:55,530 --> 00:06:02,219
objective of the cafe in framework the

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:07,470
idea was to create a framework for the

91
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:13,500
electric sector in order to have some

92
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:17,130
rules to avoid attacks India production

93
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,560
stage which is a very strategic point

94
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:23,750
both for the electric and industrial

95
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:26,120
sectors it is quite complicated to tell

96
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,419
somebody from

97
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:32,020
a plant that you're going to enter and

98
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,729
you're going to handle some machines

99
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:39,080
they want to know what you're going to

100
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:41,949
do we another objective is to boost to

101
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,820
promote the taxon the cyberattack

102
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:51,740
taxonomy that's going to be different

103
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,870
from all the presentations devoted to

104
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,360
[Music]

105
00:06:52,870 --> 00:07:01,789
taxonomy

106
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:05,720
we need to provide some regulations for

107
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:10,400
this taxonomy and finally I want to

108
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:14,600
provide set of key steps in order to

109
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:18,138
execute red team actions in a production

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,380
environment to tell the client what axis

111
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:25,250
you're going to carry out and what word

112
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:29,780
attacks they can be affected by and how

113
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:35,289
to avoid them we're going to see what

114
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:35,289
kind of attacks can happen at this stage

115
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:47,690
we're going to start talking about the

116
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,200
electric sector how a substation works

117
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:57,680
and how some devices work is basically

118
00:07:51,200 --> 00:08:00,169
the part of the control unit it is not

119
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:06,580
reflected here but it is quite important

120
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:12,710
we also have smart devices IEDs which

121
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:16,789
enable to open and close phases you're

122
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:23,340
going to see a picture which explains

123
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:28,289
what ie D can manage I have a substation

124
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:32,949
it can supply energy to some households

125
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:37,120
the general concept we also have the

126
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:40,120
part of H M I the inter the human

127
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,299
machine interface were an operator can

128
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,210
visualize operations that are developing

129
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:51,550
within the substation or it can be a

130
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:54,370
global ATM I that interacts in more than

131
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:58,660
one process and then you will have

132
00:08:54,370 --> 00:09:02,320
several several operations on the same

133
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:07,030
screen some stations are called remote

134
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:10,390
stations RT use with devices that enable

135
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:14,530
to execute control actions although

136
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:21,699
these devices starting to disappear due

137
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:24,939
to the presence of IEDs their devices at

138
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:29,650
the network level such as with switches

139
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:34,360
W learns to segment the network you can

140
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:36,850
also have a small SCADA local SCADA in

141
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,450
order to see how the process interacts

142
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:43,060
and in the stage of visualization you

143
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,290
also have them in the control unit with

144
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:50,859
a firewall if there is one or with some

145
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:54,339
network devices and then we also have

146
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,770
this the SMTP server because in the

147
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:05,350
industrial sector timing is quite

148
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:09,939
important communications that you can

149
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:14,680
find in an electric substation you have

150
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:22,360
simple values goods and MMS all these

151
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:26,050
protocols goods and sample values use

152
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:29,920
multitask which means I don't know if

153
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,709
you're more familiar with broadcast but

154
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,420
this means that you can send

155
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:39,390
packets to one address and all the

156
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:42,599
devices in the network are receiving

157
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:45,569
that message so that package these also

158
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:51,089
incorporates vulnerabilities so

159
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:55,470
manufacturers had and implemented

160
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:58,610
correctly their devices and once you

161
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:02,100
range act packages all those packages

162
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:05,430
arrive the whole network so in the end

163
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:12,720
you can have a denial of service of all

164
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:13,829
the devices within the same station we

165
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,220
have the IE

166
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:24,029
ec 104 which is a protocol of

167
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:28,610
communication which enables you to do

168
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:33,089
some reading to execute the commands to

169
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:35,970
close or open devices we're going to see

170
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:42,360
a demonstration aimed at this protocol

171
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:47,100
to another protocol which is dnp3 that

172
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:51,360
is protocol very used in America and

173
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:55,950
affects the electric sector probably in

174
00:11:51,360 --> 00:12:07,050
Europe there are some devices can be

175
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:14,490
compatible with that protocol there are

176
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:19,109
some filters and some of them can let us

177
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:29,910
detect some attack with some tools such

178
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:34,620
as these one 104 is the you type ID

179
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:36,640
equal 45 these enables you to detect

180
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,090
single commands

181
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,319
so if I detect a command I can open a

182
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:49,500
switch so I can let the electric current

183
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:53,860
pass in some devices this means to

184
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:57,490
supply energy to a host city or not the

185
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:05,350
regulation level which is always more

186
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:09,310
tedious we find the 27,000 19 which is a

187
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:13,750
standard that affects mainly the energy

188
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:16,750
sector we have a specification of the

189
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:23,230
control our monitoring systems with the

190
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:26,530
in generation and just missing stages we

191
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:29,110
need to take these regulations into

192
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:34,209
account when carrying out some actions

193
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:40,300
when accessing energy substation we also

194
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:47,050
have the IEC 6300 and 51 which is a

195
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:50,079
regulation on how protocols work I'm

196
00:13:47,050 --> 00:14:00,219
always talking about TCP protocols

197
00:13:50,080 --> 00:14:05,730
maybe in some other layer also we have

198
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:09,730
the 60 180 50 which is a goose and so on

199
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:14,800
finally we have the set of standards

200
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:17,800
IEC 62,000 443 which incorporates

201
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,160
controls and best practices you know

202
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:26,560
they for industrial entities to classify

203
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:34,000
their assets by segmenting the network

204
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:36,760
and by a spins and ensuring them this

205
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,600
present day's introduction I would also

206
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:44,230
like to comment on incidents detective

207
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,500
the industrial sector specifically the

208
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:50,290
electrical sector in other two

209
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:53,550
be more in context we're going to start

210
00:14:50,290 --> 00:15:00,360
talking about the framework and so on in

211
00:14:53,550 --> 00:15:04,650
2015 black energy great and black energy

212
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:10,630
managed to block out substation

213
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:17,079
basically this attack sent single

214
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:20,020
commands in a repeated way this was the

215
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,920
end of the incident but it was first

216
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:27,329
detected in 2007 there was a malware

217
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:32,140
which was distributed denial-of-service

218
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:35,470
attack and then is it started to evolve

219
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:39,730
this malware there was a second version

220
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:45,370
in 2010 with more functionalities such

221
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:48,970
as rootkit and so on little bit more

222
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:55,320
complicated the last version of this

223
00:15:48,970 --> 00:16:01,650
malware was in 2015 and it affected us

224
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:05,590
Ukrainian substation and then in 2014

225
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:10,480
there were the black energy light under

226
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:12,790
a black energy big one had a device you

227
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:20,910
know the not to be detected and the

228
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:24,880
other had some other variables in 2017

229
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:29,579
there was modular malware one of the

230
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:33,310
most complex ones which enabled to

231
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:40,690
attack using industrial protocols such

232
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:48,479
as IEC 104 and 101 so it disabled

233
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:53,310
legitimate communications IEC 61 850 50

234
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,310
OPC da and so on

235
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:03,610
system to discover devices and eat huge

236
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:07,120
Siemens vulnerabilities in cyberattack

237
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:13,300
and devices they were starting to

238
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:16,030
incorporate some device is not to be

239
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:20,230
detected as all the network my words

240
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:25,649
were incorporating at that time finally

241
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:29,950
we have the great energy in 2018 which

242
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:36,600
was targeted was targeting industrial

243
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:41,050
objectives industrial targets its main

244
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:44,949
was espionage and recognition and it

245
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:49,780
affected workstations that executed

246
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:53,200
SCADA software quite important for the

247
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:56,710
process and it also affected servers

248
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,520
classified as essential systems which

249
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:04,000
were rarely turned off only on specific

250
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:08,410
tasks obviously if you find these

251
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,590
malware in this kind of assets you may

252
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:14,530
think that the attackers know where

253
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:22,060
they're going and what they can do once

254
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:25,960
they reach their target data state as

255
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:29,350
they were but it didn't affect in D and

256
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,800
E operation of the process now we're

257
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:35,919
going to talk about attack taxonomies in

258
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,850
order to distinguish between the CAT

259
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:45,790
part and looking martin part what are

260
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:49,780
their differences taxonomy is a set of

261
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:53,530
stages in which you can analyze the

262
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:56,410
behavior or the modeling of an attack it

263
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,760
is like in depth analysis that you can

264
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:03,260
carry out with equipment

265
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:06,520
and you can know what actions were taken

266
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:11,360
by attackers so that you can learn from

267
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:15,290
them and use it in defensive systems

268
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,820
Blue team systems and in red teams in

269
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:21,830
order to simulate the difference between

270
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:26,299
emulate and simulate is that when you

271
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:28,668
simulate you try to do more or less the

272
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,860
same attack and when you emulate it is

273
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:36,980
that you are doing it exactly in the

274
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:43,340
same way as for mitra matrix it connects

275
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:51,500
the in fact technique we have tactics

276
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:54,168
and techniques and the technique is what

277
00:19:51,500 --> 00:20:00,559
has been done we will see that in this

278
00:19:54,169 --> 00:20:07,010
later on I just wanted to talk about the

279
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:25,610
look of Martinez we have models based on

280
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:28,640
the same one based on cyber chain I see

281
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:34,879
CIT but it doesn't me that we cannot use

282
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:38,740
caffeine in that case I would like to

283
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:45,740
explain how CA T taxonomy works

284
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:48,559
basically it is a methodology you may be

285
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:53,110
a little bit lost that's why I'm going

286
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:57,440
to tell you what the environment of CIT

287
00:20:53,110 --> 00:21:02,418
so as for strategy is what a group of

288
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,580
attackers want then how do they a how

289
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:07,020
are they going to get it then we have

290
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:11,490
tactics techniques procedures and

291
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:16,139
and then we have the evidences generated

292
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:19,800
during or after the attack you can have

293
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,440
some artifacts that detect the what they

294
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,620
have done at the host and network level

295
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,500
and then we have caffeine whose

296
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,830
objective is to generate specific

297
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,020
tactics and techniques for the

298
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:37,620
industrial sectors basically for the

299
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:40,379
electrical sector in substations and it

300
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:45,780
is here where you see the grain of

301
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:49,970
coffee also wants to develop tailor

302
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:58,020
tools or tools from other manufacturers

303
00:21:49,970 --> 00:22:01,140
how does the taxonomy work local Martin

304
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:05,160
is more known because it's used by all

305
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:11,280
these people in say 80 taxonomy there

306
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:14,970
there is a analysis threads it means

307
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,030
people are doing some research on the

308
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:26,030
target to use the micro intelligence the

309
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:26,030
micro intelligence juries target

310
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:32,600
profilers do some research on their

311
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,570
target how they're going to attacked

312
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:39,270
they analyze processes technology and

313
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:43,379
people people who are the most

314
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:50,280
vulnerable ones because it is more

315
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:53,040
difficult to create magic then we have

316
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:56,910
the commitment part we will see these

317
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,678
stages in the modeling of an attack in

318
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:04,620
the commitment stage you execute

319
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,300
necessary techniques to generate brittle

320
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,939
security breaches within the

321
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:12,419
organization then we have the

322
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,770
infiltration part so to take advantage

323
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:18,360
of those

324
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:20,730
riches they may load some tools and they

325
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,090
lay the foundations for the attack to be

326
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:29,070
executed then we have the persistence

327
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:33,240
part when they are analyzing a target

328
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:44,220
they usually come back to review what

329
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:47,580
they have somebody within your network

330
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:55,080
and you know there are Damien that is

331
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:58,020
the main complexity difficult to carry

332
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,750
out these kind of actions without being

333
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:04,590
detected then we have the internal

334
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:07,350
recognition part I am interested in

335
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,600
knowing who is around me what my main

336
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,350
targets are for example its imagine I'm

337
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:17,790
attacking a provider who provides

338
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:21,230
support for my target one condition so I

339
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:25,770
know these provider provides maintenance

340
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:27,990
to this company so I may prefer to

341
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:31,410
attack the provider because he has some

342
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:34,170
permissions such as using USB sticks for

343
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,750
example then we have the lateral

344
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:40,200
movements so moving from system to

345
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:45,600
system until we until they reach the

346
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:47,990
main the main target and then it is it

347
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:55,709
is then when they execute

348
00:24:47,990 --> 00:25:01,410
they perform the attack slide want to

349
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:05,520
explain to you why I chose these

350
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:09,540
taxonomy enables you to create no it is

351
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:14,010
not a linear pathway in the cyber kill

352
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:19,559
change you may think it is not as linear

353
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:20,990
linear plus is thought to be but that's

354
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:25,379
why I

355
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:28,860
prefer to use CA team then it shows all

356
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,950
these pages in a coherent way this is

357
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:36,510
the strategy part the main difference

358
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:40,740
between CLT to see Casey because see

359
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:47,550
Casey has no strategy and c18 does have

360
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:51,120
it so I can know in which stage I can

361
00:25:47,550 --> 00:26:07,500
use the mitra matrix based on this

362
00:25:51,120 --> 00:26:14,189
taxonomy for the army strategy that can

363
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:17,310
be used by blue teams associate I said

364
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:20,640
it has some strategies and it can adapt

365
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:23,399
to TVs what does this mean

366
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,730
this is quite important because the CIT

367
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:30,390
doesn't exclude me through matrix it

368
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:33,900
uses it the idea is to use all tactics

369
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:37,050
strategies and techniques because it is

370
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:41,400
better to work in the same direction and

371
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:46,220
not everyone on their own so that's

372
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:49,110
basically the reasons why I chose CIT

373
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:56,720
now we're going to see exactly what

374
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:56,719
caffeine is a change the name because

375
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:03,930
the energy signature so cyber attack

376
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:07,830
framework for energy infrastructures it

377
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:11,520
has a cool name and I like I love coffee

378
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:18,270
that's why I named it this way the

379
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:19,950
tactical part parts name is Karthik now

380
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,950
we're going to explain the difference

381
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:27,180
between tactic and technique it is the

382
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:32,040
way the method used in order to reach a

383
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:33,560
specific target and provide support to

384
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,710
the strategy

385
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:43,820
the tactic is the way that task is

386
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:47,600
performed we have the tool there can be

387
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:50,240
tailor-made tools or tools with exists

388
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,219
already in the sector how can I

389
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:58,190
represent all these here we have the CA

390
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:01,880
T state which is the execution of the

391
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:05,510
objective the tactic which is a trick to

392
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,970
the control center how am I going I will

393
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,950
use modification of parameters through

394
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,830
into sales protocols and then I can use

395
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:15,520
some tools such as simulating

396
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:25,030
communications with the remote unit

397
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:28,280
using escape methodologies with IEC 104

398
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:31,460
simulating communications of RT you know

399
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:35,389
the to trick the SCADA system in order

400
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:40,030
to interact with the master si esto ok

401
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:46,090
now that we all these these aside these

402
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:49,520
exercises are not going to be mutation

403
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:54,590
let's imagine a substation which is

404
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:59,060
providing it is supplying energy to City

405
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:02,389
you have the compliance part and so on

406
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:07,790
so how can we do it you know the not to

407
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:13,130
have any first you need to have some

408
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:19,030
strategy because can have these charges

409
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:22,580
within D within this substation or nodes

410
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:27,550
balances now we are in winter and it is

411
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:31,550
colder in the north than in the south so

412
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:35,590
can supply more energy to the north and

413
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,590
less energy to the south

414
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:44,390
enter substation and carry out some

415
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:46,550
actions you have agreed on with the

416
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,490
client because you have already

417
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:51,770
explained to the client tactics

418
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:55,750
techniques and tools that you're going

419
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:58,610
to use in accordance with the regulation

420
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:02,180
now I have a demonstration you know

421
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:27,770
they're not to get you bored so I'm

422
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:30,230
going to show you this demonstration are

423
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,090
you able to watch it properly so these

424
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,240
are the most stringent I have here an

425
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,439
electrical substation that is

426
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,960
interacting with the protocol that I've

427
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:45,680
mentioned before the protocols dnp3 that

428
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,570
effect especially America so here have a

429
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,360
screen shot I have a master and a client

430
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:55,780
and here you can see how there is normal

431
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:59,419
communication this is local localhost

432
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:01,810
five seven zero zero one this is a

433
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:07,840
closed environment such as an industrial

434
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:12,139
environment inside these communications

435
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,810
there are some responses by the master

436
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:17,120
and the climber is some interaction I

437
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:20,750
need to know some parameters in order to

438
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:24,800
see how the process is working and also

439
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,510
I want to send some control commands so

440
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,710
what are we going to do right now we are

441
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:32,960
going to try to use passing techniques

442
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:36,620
with means with means that we are going

443
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,740
to use different parts of the protocol

444
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:43,219
in order to start changing valleys so

445
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:48,230
that there are modifications and many

446
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:49,550
orders are sent so here we used on I his

447
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:56,780
saucer

448
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:58,820
at the level of the mp3 you may send

449
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:01,310
things that are well or about

450
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:03,530
implemented but at the level of the

451
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:06,260
faster level you just want to generate

452
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:07,490
an anomalous state within the device so

453
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:11,840
it makes sense

454
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:16,520
sending strings that are wrong so it

455
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,139
send these wrong strings and how am I

456
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,530
going to detect that someone has

457
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,840
accessed and has used officer in order

458
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:26,180
to interact with a device that may be

459
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,429
active in my environment well we're

460
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:33,710
going to use our qivana

461
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:36,940
kavana is fed mainly by a probe by a

462
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:44,000
sari by a sensor that sends information

463
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:46,880
so this is an LK in our qivana one

464
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,220
receives information the other one takes

465
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,520
that information since the information

466
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,920
in a coherent way and with a format that

467
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,940
may be understood by qivana which is the

468
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:01,460
tool that's going to to do their

469
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,310
different steps and then in the panel

470
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,050
someone may interact and choose

471
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:11,990
different filters I don't know if gives

472
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:16,070
being able to see it but here if you

473
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:18,680
click the zoom there are more more

474
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:21,139
filters I don't know that if you can see

475
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,590
from there there's also a company

476
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:27,830
technology being used and this gives you

477
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:30,500
the chance to access specific traffic

478
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:34,040
screenshots that may be of interest to

479
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:37,190
an analyst that may have tests we have

480
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:40,520
tested some weird traffic or any other

481
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:46,400
type of problem within the network so

482
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:49,310
here we have the strings and for example

483
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,560
this can be downloaded in order to

484
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:55,310
visualize it with a different tool so if

485
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:57,889
you download this you can see that there

486
00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:00,440
are wrong strings and something else

487
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:02,210
that I skipped before and I think it's

488
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,610
quite interesting

489
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:10,760
is that here we have the sector called

490
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:12,230
bro allows you to interpret the

491
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,600
different strings and there are also

492
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:17,630
some connections in which it says

493
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:20,120
Broadway these are weird connections so

494
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:28,940
the tool is already detecting that there

495
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:31,759
are some connections that are using of

496
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:34,010
the nb3 which are wrong something's

497
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,030
something's wrong with them there is

498
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:40,040
some something that are weird I didn't

499
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:43,450
mention that and I think actually quite

500
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:48,620
important so someone I've seen their

501
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:50,719
pickup should look at it and we should

502
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:55,130
be able to understand that there are

503
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:57,560
wrong strains and as I've said we can

504
00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:00,110
even apply a filter in order to identify

505
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,350
the wrong strings in a period of time

506
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,460
and these may imply that someone is

507
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,589
using a fossa

508
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,290
so there are more advanced techniques

509
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,240
that use different levels of

510
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:14,300
communications that may indicate that a

511
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,910
passer is being used it depends a lot on

512
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:21,440
the detector and the depth that you want

513
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:26,180
to apply so here you can see all the

514
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,340
wrong strings so we can see that an

515
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:31,549
attacker is using a faster and therefore

516
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:34,220
we can realize that some of us in

517
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:36,710
techniques are being being used in the

518
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,259
system I have another demonstration that

519
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:46,100
I would like to explain a little bit

520
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:54,050
more another demonstration in order to

521
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:57,170
detect their eye is the 104 attack that

522
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:00,890
uses the single command that we've seen

523
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:03,490
before so this is a this is not related

524
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:06,170
to demonstrations this is a rule a

525
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:10,129
man-in-the-middle rule that may be used

526
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:14,650
in IEC 104 and this is the

527
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,650
infrastructure that has been set up

528
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:21,390
so we have a rotor switch which is open

529
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:24,480
source with a viata distribution you can

530
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,910
create your architecture and do several

531
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,690
things there is a probe with its nori

532
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:34,350
and this is analyzing the traffic and

533
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:36,960
then we have this cutter Network and the

534
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:40,830
master and slave areas which are in this

535
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:46,830
case exchanging the IEC 104 and now I

536
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:49,080
want to show you the demonstration well

537
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:51,090
this is more dynamic and I don't have to

538
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,400
think that much but here you can see

539
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:56,460
there I see I see

540
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,010
104 strains so here you have the single

541
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:07,170
commands that I've mentioned before here

542
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:10,790
you can see is 45 you need to detect it

543
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:13,890
on the tool but we already can see that

544
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:16,050
how to identify these type of attacks

545
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:18,509
for example let's train being injected

546
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:22,620
or DLL which is malicious that is

547
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:24,450
interacting with the process and for

548
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:27,270
example we can realize if there are

549
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,549
strings being exchanged in a high

550
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,460
frequency it's not logical to have a

551
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:34,950
person switching on and switching off

552
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:37,290
putting service in removing service in a

553
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:39,000
very short period of time so this is not

554
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,920
done this is not something that is

555
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,860
usually done so when someone is

556
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:48,150
switching on and switching off these are

557
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:51,800
industrial switches so it shouldn't be

558
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:58,110
frequent so here we can see this not

559
00:37:51,800 --> 00:38:00,450
it's starting up the master and the

560
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,280
slave are interacting there is an

561
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:07,140
opening and closing phase with the

562
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:09,420
different talks that I see 140 is using

563
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:13,250
then we can see how this interacting and

564
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,780
sending packages in the graphic level I

565
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:20,850
can go into advanced a little bit

566
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:23,730
because we don't have much time so here

567
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:25,480
we have their writings simulators are

568
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,970
being used

569
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:34,630
and an attacker could modify a dll and

570
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:37,689
could do more sophisticated attacks here

571
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:40,300
we can see that this is part of our

572
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:43,089
platform this norbi platform that allows

573
00:38:40,300 --> 00:39:07,869
you to visualize everything that's going

574
00:38:43,089 --> 00:39:10,380
on it takes a while is 45 this helps us

575
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:13,300
to detect a single command because this

576
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,800
involves detecting parties and cutting

577
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,730
them in order to obtain information that

578
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,230
we want to obtain so we've added a

579
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:24,040
filter here in order to detect that

580
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:26,950
command in a specific period of time and

581
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:30,640
right now we can see here different

582
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:34,210
pieces of information very very

583
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,359
different requests in a short period of

584
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:42,130
time and this is how we've detected that

585
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:44,500
problem and in the end this is going to

586
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,839
let you know that and then attacker is

587
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,460
injecting traffic or streams or

588
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:53,650
interacting with the system without a

589
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:57,490
permit and how is Mitra

590
00:39:53,650 --> 00:40:05,230
modeling in Mitra we have different

591
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:08,729
tactics and techniques classified so I

592
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:13,500
have these matrix for example and

593
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:13,500
depending on the place in which I am

594
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:22,030
they're going to be different tactics

595
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:25,569
techniques etc can we see it in a more

596
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:30,940
graphical way yes with CIT I think this

597
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:32,950
is clear you can see the targeting of an

598
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:38,499
attacker Who am I I'm going to talk

599
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:43,729
about information of the company

600
00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:46,189
phishing with an embedded document how

601
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:50,178
everything is integrated in order to

602
00:40:46,189 --> 00:40:53,769
keep on and infecting infiltration

603
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:56,089
persistence I don't want to explain this

604
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:58,218
into the appetite or have much time and

605
00:40:56,089 --> 00:41:00,259
I want to leave room for questions but I

606
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:02,119
think that this is already quite clear I

607
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:03,739
don't know what what do you think but

608
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:07,459
this is the whole process basically the

609
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:11,989
process if it's on the internet there

610
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:14,868
are documents that may explain these in

611
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:16,309
general terms I mean I know that you

612
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:18,169
cannot read right now

613
00:41:16,309 --> 00:41:19,729
what's reading right what's riding on

614
00:41:18,169 --> 00:41:21,709
the slide but this is going to be

615
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:23,658
available to you and if you have any

616
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:26,209
question you can ask me at any moment

617
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:27,679
but this is also going to allow you to

618
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:29,569
see if there are different lines of

619
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:31,039
attacks because there may be the two

620
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:32,869
different teams are talking at the same

621
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,849
time and they are it's not going to be

622
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:37,130
executing the same techniques or using

623
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:39,079
the same methods and the timelines are

624
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,719
going to be different too so if I'm

625
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:44,689
being attacked in two different

626
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:46,939
directions I'm going also to know and

627
00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:51,229
also regarding the objective here we can

628
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:53,419
see the different options that great

629
00:41:51,229 --> 00:41:58,038
energy developers may have done in order

630
00:41:53,419 --> 00:42:02,348
to impact on the process and finally

631
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:05,359
here have a website and anyone that

632
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:10,899
provides information on how everything

633
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:15,259
interacts and as you can see right now a

634
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:20,328
person may use and bring up machine a

635
00:42:15,259 --> 00:42:22,999
Windows and in this case there was a

636
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:25,719
malicious document that could be

637
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:28,759
interpreted incorporated into the tool

638
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:31,159
in the end this is a sandbox and it's

639
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:34,759
going to allow you to obtain quite a lot

640
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:36,229
of information so here you can see

641
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:39,109
everything that's interacting and

642
00:42:36,229 --> 00:42:41,689
everything that's going on macros are

643
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:43,669
being enabled disabled until the

644
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:48,440
infection takes place also you can

645
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:51,910
obtain the case you can see the DNA

646
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,300
as if their DNA's are malicious or not

647
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:58,399
you can also get commitment indicators

648
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:01,940
all of course the tool itself is using

649
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,380
them already the process under execution

650
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,780
and also something which is quite

651
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:14,630
interesting which is new is the tactic

652
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:19,280
and technique part based on mitra that

653
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:21,440
you've seen before it's based on these

654
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:27,590
protective contact techniques and

655
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:34,310
tactics techniques and tactics so well I

656
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:36,860
will try to upload the techniques on

657
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:42,290
techniques as soon as possible to github

658
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:44,210
because even though me trace more

659
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:49,120
oriented towards information

660
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:59,360
technologies it's true that right now

661
00:43:49,120 --> 00:44:02,330
they are working on that issue so here

662
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,270
you also have some links that may be

663
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:08,120
interesting links related to projects of

664
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:10,520
some people for example the first link

665
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,740
is from a project that was launched like

666
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,320
the day before yesterday and he talks

667
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,000
about how detecting tactics and

668
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,770
techniques

669
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,580

00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:30,730
ask you if you you've seen a commitment

692
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:33,720
indicate or in malware's related to

693
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:36,609
electrical networks or industry I mean

694
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:40,930
something which is different from common

695
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:43,029
malware's that we've seen lately common

696
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:44,980
indicator you mean any weird string or

697
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:48,819
something like that well in this regard

698
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:50,950
yes I have but because that malware is

699
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:54,819
specific so so you may have an indicator

700
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:56,890
that me may be looking to anise 2 for

701

702
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:01,299

703
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:04,390
some communications that is industrial

704
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:07,869
protocols but regarding DNS or DNS
