2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,849
good morning everyone thank you

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,390
introduction before I start I would like

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:25,980
to thanks in thanking fever for inviting

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:29,939
us to cyber camp because it's already a

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,540
reference in cybersecurity in Spain now

7
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:39,210
today I'm going to talk about the cyber

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:41,219
security training plan which CB in

9
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,800
Valencia but I'm not only going to talk

10
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,890
about that because I would also like you

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,209
to know a little bit about the center I

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,160
don't know if some of you know us

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,300
already but I would like to show you

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:01:00,690
some of the senses that we giving we

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:10,860
started our activity in 2008 we are part

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:13,560
of model regional government and we were

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:18,180
pioneers in Spain because we were the

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,090
first Center to respond respond to

19
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,330
incidents at a regional level

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,830
there was another Center that was

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,869
started at a national level but we were

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,298
the first ones to do it's a regional

23
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:36,539
relational and we not only work in the

24
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:45,360
Valencian regional community but we also

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:52,460
work institutions such as Valencian

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:55,200
citizens and we have had to adapt

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,630
throughout the years to the needs for

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,930
the protection that the society has been

29
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,210
having all these years they have changed

30
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,580
a law because in

31
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,880
last twelve years the landscape of

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:11,240
cybersecurity has changed crime has

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:14,750
evolved and where before we used to face

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,630
threats the way more predictable easier

35
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,489
to fight and mitigate we know

36
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:23,000
unfortunately how this has evolved

37
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:25,610
nowadays this made us evolve as well in

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,440
our defense strategy I'm going to tell

39
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,530
you about all the stages that we've been

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,500
through but I did want to mention what

41
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,510
we're doing where we are right now

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,780
because it's important to understand why

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,310
we have deployed this strategy some

44
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,290
three four years ago

45
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:53,000
we had to analyze our environment to see

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:57,290
exactly where we had to go Society we

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,030
are facing rapidly changing changes

48
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,940
hyper-connectivity mobility

49
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:06,709
technological acceleration because eight

50
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,400
the connection that brought the Internet

51
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:09,769
of Things

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,840
all in all a combination of forces that

53
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:16,130
was going to transform as nothing before

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,470
transformed in the history of humanity

55
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,989
so was taking us towards a digital

56
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,390
society what we know is digital

57
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:25,820
transformation nowadays and at the same

58
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:29,350
time a few phenomena were taking place a

59
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,910
very strong convergence process where

60
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,250
fuels were traditionally has been

61
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,959
working with technologies only related

62
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,200
to that two fields were starting to

63
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,560
converge and it looked as if we were all

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,510
starting to use the same technology same

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,620
applications and operational systems and

66
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:53,600
so the risks unfortunately were also

67
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:56,239
converted because we all share we were

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,880
seeing already we was taking as towards

69
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,239
and hyper connected environment hyper

70
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:07,010
technological environment the low price

71
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,300
of mobile telephones that universal to

72
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,980
everything the fact that all systems

73
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,840
opened up to the internet even systems

74
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,690
that have not been designed for that

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:23,070
because that's what citizens companies

76
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:26,650
and services demand as demand from us

77
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,900
that was making our world really really

78
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,960
difficult for all of us who were

79
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,479
traditionally protecting information

80
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,909
systems and we saw that it was becoming

81
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,130
more and more difficult to determine

82
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,690
where the board is where an organization

83
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,580
was its perimeter was there was the

84
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,430
borders were getting dirt more and more

85
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,200
and so we draw the compared River

86
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,770
completion because the board is where

87
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,890
people and that is why our Center

88
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:01,030
deployed over two years ago a strategy

89
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:03,969
it's we're focused on people on training

90
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,539
people in cybersecurity and on making

91
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,460
everyone understand the importance of

92
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:13,180
protecting our information both at a

93
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:16,599
professional now this plan has already

94
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,300
been launched and it's working to raise

95
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,370
awareness among among balancing systems

96
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,340
citizens about security of information

97
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:27,520
about the use of technology so we want

98
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,710
for citizens to be part of these defense

99
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,799
we want them to become the human

100
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:35,409
firewalls people who can identify the

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,500
risks that they're exposed to and who

102
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,330
are able to face those risks so we

103
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,120
started a long time ago we have to

104
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,940
carefully analyze people we were facing

105
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,150
and identify the groups we were going in

106
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:52,780
to work with and meet it needs also in

107
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:57,489
terms of training define we're going to

108
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:00,130
teach find the channels and the format's

109
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,760
are going to be new adequate for

110
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:06,940
everyone great because it's not the same

111
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,610
training a managing director or someone

112
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:16,030
who's being

113
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:20,639
the victim of gender violence and the

114
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:23,318
main three groups of people we are

115
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,039
focusing without awareness-raising is

116
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:30,430
companies public administrations and

117
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:32,139
citizens now companies it's already and

118
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,810
a few months we will be able to launch

119
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:37,240
this program with public administrations

120
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,439
we have already been working even before

121
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,779
we gave it a name we had already been

122
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:49,360
working with them and having training

123
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:52,330
for them especially within and with

124
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,819
citizens we found there was a great

125
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,640
diversity so we decided to prioritize

126
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:59,639
those groups which were more vulnerable

127
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,949
[Music]

128
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,939
underage and young people women victims

129
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:10,599
of sexual violence and gender violence

130
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:13,060
but also professional groups because of

131
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:15,159
what they do have to deal with sensitive

132
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:19,439
or confidential information that has a

133
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:28,960
high thoughts attackers these could be

134
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:34,029
hospital doctors lawyers we have already

135
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:37,899
done training for them today and so as

136
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:42,159
to focus on the audience that we have

137
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:50,379
here I'm going to talk about what you're

138
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:52,839
doing for young people teenagers are

139
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:56,259
considered to be digital natives because

140
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:58,300
you have been born with technology you

141
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:05,409
haven't had to suffer the adaptation

142
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:08,560
process that other groups have had to

143
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:11,560
undergo and the fact that you haven't

144
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,909
had to adapt which is really good it

145
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:18,099
makes at the same time so that teenager

146
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:19,240
grew the group of teenagers think that

147
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:23,800
they are experts

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:26,620
they undervalue risks they don't see

149
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,650
themselves as victims and hence this

150
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,520
makes it more threatening the different

151
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,338
risk awakens faces the lack of awareness

152
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,978
together with the for security or

153
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:43,719
feeling security that internet rings we

154
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:46,720
have started this plan now we are not

155
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:50,410
only focusing it on teenagers but also

156
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,440
on the parents and on their teachers why

157
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:58,270
because we are aiming every single

158
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:01,270
school and educational center private or

159
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:05,020
public in the region and we're going to

160
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:08,140
prioritize second and third year of

161
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,569
secondary education student why because

162
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,330
there are several actors in society who

163
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,690
have to share objective with us this in

164
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:21,120
FIBA who is bringing very very valuable

165
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:24,550
help to these groups with these cyber

166
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:29,560
helpers many people who work at our

167
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,479
Center are also cyber helpers we know

168
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,109
that in FEMA has been very valuable

169
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,520
material we started actually things with

170
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:41,800
them you know facing such a big group we

171
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,930
wanted to work together not to compete

172
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,810
against each other but rather to find

173
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,969
where we could help each other we saw

174
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:53,800
that in theory was a bit more centered

175
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:56,200
on primary school children and so we

176
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,449
thought that we could take from what

177
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,430
they had already started and focus on

178
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:05,740
second and third year of secondary

179
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:08,410
school why also parents and teachers

180
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:14,470
well because we do talk about digital

181
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:18,520
natives but I think it would be rather

182
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,680
more accurate to say digital orphans

183
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,439
because neither parents nor teachers

184
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,810
know how to deal with the relationship

185
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,960
that the children have with technology

186
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:32,500
and it is very easy to go like an

187
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,810
ostrich and hide your head and say well

188
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,460
this is not for my generation my son or

189
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,310
my daughter already knows a lot about

190
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,550
this but we're going to show you how

191
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:45,310
training and teaching children is it has

192
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,319
actually a very positive effect now what

193
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:51,219
we are doing is we're having awareness

194
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:55,270
raising sessions and workshops with

195
00:10:51,220 --> 00:11:00,460
students also with their parents and

196
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:03,760
with the teachers everything aimed at

197
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,340
our students we had to thought about how

198
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,260
we were going to do it how to draw their

199
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,740
attention because as you know it's not

200
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:14,140
easy to get teenagers interested

201
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,890
especially in things on things that they

202
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:21,270
already think that it expects on and we

203
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:28,060
having really good results I might say

204
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:30,370
so we have little training pills and

205
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,430
what's really innovative is how we

206
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:39,060
present them we get them into a room for

207
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:43,140
one and a half hours with with a speaker

208
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:46,979
session and simulates the physical

209
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:49,060
behavior of a teenager and so we

210
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,920
recreative neurological environment

211
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,609
which is exactly the same as teenagers

212
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:59,430
will find on their day to day same kind

213
00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:03,870
of devices tablets applications games

214
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:06,099
and so the speaker will portray a

215
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:10,270
student and there will be a hacker with

216
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:14,550
them during the session who is making

217
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,550
the most out of all the mistakes

218
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:27,400
that the speaker is making to still his

219
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:30,140
possible passwords personality and

220
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,930
reactions are very diverse some people

221
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,000
some of them actually get angry most of

222
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,089
them want to learn to be hackers but

223
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,740
it's true that they pay attention from

224
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:45,200
the word they don't stop other than

225
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,150
these sessions were not just going to

226
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,810
teach them a lesson and say see you're

227
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:53,930
vulnerable - so what we do is active it

228
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,630
we take them to a workshop with less

229
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:58,939
people and we give them the resources

230
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:01,400
for them to be able to manage their

231
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,350
security we teach them how to use

232
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,720
password managers because they're all

233
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,140
used to having exactly the same

234
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,630
passwords predictable of writing them on

235
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,449
it posted at selling them to a friend

236
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:19,430
and the not change it well all the bad

237
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:20,720
practices you can imagine we teach them

238
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,810
to limit permissions and the

239
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,780
applications that we use visibility of

240
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,910
the publications and social media

241
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:33,410
configure the mobile devices in a safe

242
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:34,790
way the double authentication factor so

243
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,760
basically which is give them the

244
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,380
necessary tools to them not to be so

245
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,610
vulnerable once they have realized that

246
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:50,030
they are indeed and we also have

247
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:53,530
sessions for parents they live well the

248
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,770
approach is the same same sort of

249
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:56,870
training

250
00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:02,180
hilts but obviously B approaches a bit

251
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:05,240
different because our idea is that they

252
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:08,989
get to know first of all the language so

253
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,730
those children use that they know the

254
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:15,020
typical behavior when it comes to

255
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:17,480
technology use and at the end today but

256
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:20,960
we give parents the resources they need

257
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,740
to be able to help their children in

258
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,589
something which is a screw

259
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:28,290
so as the relationship with technology

260
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:30,500
and at the end of the session we run

261
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:34,130
service and we'll share the results

262
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:37,709
afterwards we get really good

263
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:40,910
assessments but they're all unanimous in

264
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:43,979
saying that it's not so complicated if

265
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:46,469
we give it a little bit of work and the

266
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,430
children don't know as much as they

267
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:53,550
think they do

268
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:55,800
so we also have training sessions and we

269
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,750
do that in the last few days we've had

270
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,689
experiences with parents with children

271
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:03,630
and we explained the same thing but with

272
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,779
a double objective on the one hand being

273
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,450
the first line to ask questions for

274
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:13,100
their students and on the other hand to

275
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:17,430
also make them aware of the sensitivity

276
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:19,290
BMP we need to have on certain behaviors

277
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:26,729
like sexting and grooming would

278
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:37,319
unfortunately increasing we've seen that

279
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:38,700
it is and well the instructor was not so

280
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:44,370
she does not like this is the beginning

281
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:46,940
we had a pilot together with the

282
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:50,510
original government school education

283
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:53,310
through the association and the network

284
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:57,120
the secondary school directors gave us

285
00:15:53,310 --> 00:16:00,359
14 private public centers in caste and

286
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:05,160
volunteer in Alicante were we could

287
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:08,010
Tesla the Sun and that and the

288
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:13,380
suggestions that we thank we launched

289
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:15,240
the program and we can release one of

290
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,779
the things that we were taught is it was

291
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,770
very important to foster and to

292
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:24,630
encourage parents to take part because

293
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,970
the older the parent are the children

294
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,520
are the less parents go to

295
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,580
parent-teacher meetings at school even

296
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,760
if they find it interesting so we helped

297
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:39,960
directors to explain all the

298
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,270
requirements leaflets to center parents

299
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,720
we even give them the letter to give to

300
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:46,800
the parent association of the school and

301
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,410
then they do whatever they want

302
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,400
obviously because they know their

303
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:56,189
students and their parents but that

304
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:59,490
together with word of mouth has really

305
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:03,420
helped to increase parents participation

306
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:06,510
in decisions and to finish I just wanted

307
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:11,750
to show you what both students and

308
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:14,459
parents is about this service we knew

309
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:18,380
that we had explained before we chose

310
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:21,209
them and about 70 percent said they did

311
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,130
then we asked them about the favorite

312
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,589
subject terms and we've added a few

313
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,290
things we hadn't had into account at the

314
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:31,260
beginning then we took ask them whether

315
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:35,399
they felt more prepared to face these

316
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:39,420
strips after sessions and 94% said yes

317
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:43,050
this was now because any comments I have

318
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:46,890
only brought those which has relevant

319
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:51,770
that it was very interesting that it did

320
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:55,770
draw their attention which is a success

321
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:59,760
there's no school where at least 10 or

322
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:01,530
15 have students say they want to be

323
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,220
hackers I imagine they want to be

324
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:08,220
ethical hackers but well anyway we do

325
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,730
seem to manage to raise awareness

326
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,680
amongst them about cybersecurity and

327
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:18,540
there's the objective at the end of the

328
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:20,280
day now concerning teachers answers the

329
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,040
resource are very similar to those of

330
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,680
the parents although you can see a bit

331
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,670
of contrast concerning the perception

332
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,010
that parents and

333
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,260
teachers have of the knowledge of

334
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,900
threats that children have compared to

335
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,760
what they actually think they have and

336
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,320
most parents and teachers think that

337
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,780
teenagers are actually not aware of

338
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,790
these threats they all think they need

339
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,560
information such as the one we are

340
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:48,040
finding these sessions they think it's

341
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:50,110
very interesting adequate and very

342
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,750
interesting to have parents and teachers

343
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,350
together one thing I didn't mention

344
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:59,110
before that we realized during the pilot

345
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:02,379
sessions we used to only call the

346
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,149
parents of the students who were going

347
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,210
to attend the sessions and we thought

348
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:10,240
well if the center can fit all the

349
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:12,340
parents in the school in a room then why

350
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,540
not have them all so that there are no

351
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,399
restrictions nowadays anymore so parents

352
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,909
and teachers can come if there's room

353
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,910
for everyone

354
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,710
so the comments from the teachers morale

355
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,750
it's same that's very interesting that's

356
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,740
well organized it should be a bigotry

357
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:35,500
and the surveys from parents similar to

358
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:39,880
those of the teachers of what they think

359
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:41,830
about the how whether children are aware

360
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,990
of them all around 90 percent believe

361
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,580
they are aware of the risks and whether

362
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,760
or not they thought the sessions were

363
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,280
useful most said they were the comments

364
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:55,720
from the parents were also very similar

365
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,230
to those given by teachers I just wanted

366
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:03,480
to bring you some figures to show you

367
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:07,540
how far we've gone up until last month

368
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:11,380
we've reached 14,500 people between

369
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:18,399
teachers students mothers and fathers in

370
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:20,980
Gaston Valencian alicante by the end of

371
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,820
the year we want to go to another 28

372
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:31,110
schools and for next year by the end of

373
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:32,620
June 37 schools have already requested

374
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:37,659
participation

375
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:39,189
in this these sessions and cost we have

376
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:44,860
options to include them that will

377
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:48,190
continue including the schools so during

378
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,129
the launch phase we've we doubled the

379
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,260
team and now we will have a third team

380
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:59,470
so we will probably increase their

381
00:20:53,260 --> 00:21:01,629
participation in the sessions so this

382
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,840
was about the plan that we have for

383
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:09,100
cyber security in Valencia aimed at

384
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:13,419
young people and adolescents this isn't

385
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:15,309
everything that we do in the plan but

386
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:20,230
I'd like to talk about other services

387
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:24,300
that we are offering we also work in

388
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:28,390
other races we don't only work for the

389
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:30,550
Ballon thean Community Council but we

390
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,460
work for other administrations as well

391
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:37,600
these are the blocks of services that we

392
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:41,080
offer and as the same as any dessert not

393
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,809
only here in Valencia all the services

394
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,590
offered each community are broken up

395
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:51,780
into three parts which are prevention in

396
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:56,350
first instance services for detection

397
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:59,379
everything that we do in terms of when

398
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:05,110
and where incidents are happening in our

399
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:11,200
area and there's a group of services for

400
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:14,260
response we briefly go into what we do

401
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,540
in these prevention services other than

402
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:21,629
the awareness and the plan that was

403
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:24,610
talking about foreign training the

404
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:28,480
government in Valencia has a number of

405
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:31,330
technological parks that a technological

406
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,880
centers that give support to citizens

407
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:37,300
and to businesses and other institutions

408
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:41,860
and to their own employees

409
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:45,970
it's a very complex ecosystem with more

410
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,340
than 250,000 entities and many many

411
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:52,380
different servers and all the

412
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:57,550
electronics for the network and around

413
00:22:52,380 --> 00:23:00,610
1,500 I think applications we have the

414
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:07,180
object is to ensure that these services

415
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:08,740
and these IT entities are safe and if

416
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,260
they are not safe then we can't

417
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,740
guarantee the safety of all the data and

418
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,740
all the services that we provide

419
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,150
obviously this is a huge job they have

420
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,180
to carry out to ensure that everything

421
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:25,500
is secure and safe so what do we do I'll

422
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,880
explain this a little bit now and

423
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,770
specifically what we do here with

424
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:34,570
relation to the local government it's

425
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:38,770
two points of view in terms of the

426
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:41,830
infrastructure for IT we have the vision

427
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:44,770
from the outside in terms of our

428
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:49,090
technological services and also from the

429
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:52,300
insight from the corporate network this

430
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:54,580
enables us to find some issues that we

431
00:23:52,300 --> 00:24:00,030
have in security and ways of resolving

432
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:02,649
them and we also have in solution tests

433
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:05,410
any application any corporate

434
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,390
application that is going to be used

435
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:11,460
should go through a intrusion test

436
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:13,600
before it is used there are tests for

437
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,960
vulnerabilities to identify these

438
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,949
vulnerabilities and what we do is that

439
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,260
one of our analysts goes in and goes to

440
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:25,690
the information system and tries to

441
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:30,520
penetrate it in the same way as a hacker

442
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:33,670
would this brings up any gaps that we

443
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:37,810
have in our security before an

444
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:39,980
application goes out we have an

445
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,950
environment security services

446
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:46,789
reports and alerts and we have more than

447
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:49,909
50 people working in the council and the

448
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:53,149
local government reeva receive a daily

449
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:55,580
report regarding the main threats for

450
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:59,830
each day in terms of vulnerabilities

451
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,830
that could affect them malicious traffic

452
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:08,029
peer-to-peer access insecure access

453
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:11,120
remote access that have not been

454
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:14,620
authorized and so on information that

455
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,379
allows them to secure their environment

456
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:21,590
we have a malware laboratory that we

457
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:23,840
analyze the software because they have

458
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:26,629
been put onto our platform or because we

459
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,629
have detected themselves due to a

460
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:31,279
proactive analysis and that we think

461
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,470
that so they need to be analysts

462
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,389
analyzed in order to extract their data

463
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,779
from them and to feed back into our

464
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:42,760
system then we have a number of other

465
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:48,919
services regarding technical and legal

466
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:53,679
consultancy with regard to data

467
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:57,519
protection and other areas we do

468
00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:01,010
follow-up and analyses and audits

469
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:07,309
analysis of risks and then last of all

470
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:09,379
we have the section is not only directed

471
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:14,450
towards citizens because all of the

472
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:17,049
other ones are also for for our citizens

473
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:22,010
as well to ensure that they are safe

474
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:23,929
these services at the bottom for

475
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:27,250
dissemination of information and

476
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:30,769
training and awareness are more directly

477
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:33,889
for citizens and citizens come and look

478
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:36,080
at that on our webpage so let's have a

479
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:37,459
little look at some of these services so

480
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,610
that you can

481
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,429
and understand which of these might be

482
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:45,529
of interest to you

483
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:49,669
so WWDC search

484
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:53,480
cv g'v a DHS was the first webpage that

485
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:56,960
we had for the public and we covered

486
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:00,200
matters related with security and news

487
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,630
regarding the main vulnerabilities in

488
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,990
applications the kind of applications

489
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:08,860
that people would generally use this is

490
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:12,770
also available in another format such as

491
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:15,289
bulletins and notice sports and people

492
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:20,770
can sign up to these through this web

493
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:23,270
page and search gets information readily

494
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,679
but we only send our information then we

495
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:29,870
have to advise of something in

496
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:32,630
particular to be any fishing that has

497
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,489
been going on information on incidents

498
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:39,500
that have occurred and there's another

499
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:41,960
section regarding preventing any kind of

500
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,200
infection and in order to be able to

501
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:49,070
navigate in a safe manner so this is the

502
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:53,809
main image of the center toward to the

503
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:56,059
general public now for the last two

504
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:58,428
years we've also have another portal

505
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:04,370
which is specifically for different

506
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:07,940
others the portal has increasing amount

507
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:10,520
of information of interest for citizens

508
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,490
and people who use the internet so that

509
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:17,690
they have information on awareness and

510
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:20,990
knowledge of using networks it's aimed

511
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:24,710
at all ages all levels people who are

512
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:27,710
more technical people who are not and

513
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:32,210
it's available in different formats we

514
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:36,950
have training courses that are free they

515
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:38,809
are advertised on the web page we have

516
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,779
some more specialized course and a

517
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:45,840
little bit longer courses as well as

518
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:49,380
micro courses and these are related we

519
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,909
the subjects and areas that people who

520
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:58,040
have no idea of cybersecurity can relate

521
00:28:52,910 --> 00:29:02,810
such as using the internet safely

522
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:05,760
malware an introduction to cybercrime

523
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:09,899
wireless networks and so on there's a

524
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:15,680
great deal of availability then there's

525
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:21,840
more technical issues such as Android

526
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:23,100
devices and nmap and I think people in

527
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,600
general on the whole wouldn't need to

528
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:30,600
use these but these are available for

529
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:33,840
whoever wants to sign up Center else has

530
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,060
profiles on social media and we use

531
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:41,240
these to send out campaigns awareness

532
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:41,240
campaigns and advice on different areas

533
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:48,780
come out in certain caesars such as the

534
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:51,630
ones in in the summer regarding attacks

535
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:53,129
that you can be aware of we need to be

536
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:56,070
aware of us you go on holiday or when

537
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:59,130
you're shopping also we do campaigns

538
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:02,399
with other subjects such as the one we

539
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:05,760
did covering the elections so that we

540
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:10,080
could teach citizens to distinguish

541
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:14,370
between fake and real news and also how

542
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:17,790
to make their devices safe how to make

543
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:21,560
the businesses safe and these campaigns

544
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:23,930
can be followed on in blind and all this

545
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:27,330
information and all this advice is

546
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:29,130
prepared in a guide format also and

547
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:35,120
available for whoever wish to download

548
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:39,090
it we also have information on specific

549
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,219
subjects such as things that are going

550
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,830
on threats that are happening around

551
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,410
Christmas or threats on the internet of

552
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:50,070
things or precautions that you need to

553
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:52,980
keep in mind on different devices and

554
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:55,720
these are a range of different subjects

555
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:59,559
that we cover and available to download

556
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:02,140
la parte de so I'd like to talk a little

557
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:06,490
bit more about the guidelines that we

558
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:10,210
have this is regarding security or your

559
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:13,419
own content and we have collaboration

560
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:16,059
with identities such as in thei Bay and

561
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:18,940
I think it's worth mentioning because

562
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:23,889
our different guidelines cover different

563
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:27,669
areas and now we have more than 1

564
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:31,200
million two hundred two hundred so there

565
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:37,390
are some that every technical and these

566
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:39,220
being used to rather a lot so in terms

567
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,750
of prevention and services there are

568
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,289
many that we have but I can't mention

569
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:46,120
them all here please have a look at how

570
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:49,000
to web pages and I'm sure you'll find

571
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,668
information of interest there and now

572
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,840
I'd like to go on to talk a little bit

573
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:59,049
now about other of the big areas of work

574
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:05,500
that we have in our Center which are the

575
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:08,530
detection services despite the amount of

576
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:14,289
technology that is used for detection

577
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:17,649
services this is the most simple of the

578
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:23,679
and manual of all the systems that we

579
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:25,539
have I'll talk about everything that we

580
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,830
have in our corporate read and the

581
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:32,620
analysis that we undertake but we have

582
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:37,510
also noticed that as we increase

583
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:40,928
awareness amongst users then there are

584
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:46,590
also a number of threats that they are

585
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:49,120
able to detect and report on the

586
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:53,709
corporate network we have an ability to

587
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:58,178
catch traffic and we're able to analyze

588
00:32:53,710 --> 00:33:00,340
data bytes per second and soon we will

589
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:01,830
have an another system similar to this

590
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:06,600
we have a

591
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:10,168
cluster of three in detection systems on

592
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,350
the corporate network and probes in

593
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:16,409
specific parts of the network so how

594
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:22,320
does this work I'd like to explain this

595
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:26,700
graph upon here you can see the

596
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:30,870
protected domain of the local council

597
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:33,690
and government and this is a layer that

598
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:37,678
covers and collects all the alerts that

599
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:42,470
are generated it's down here you can see

600
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:49,169
elements of our network that firewalls

601
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:51,899
traffic consoler for the antivirus email

602
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:54,840
and so on and all these continually

603
00:33:51,899 --> 00:34:02,850
being monitored and they emit or give

604
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:07,280
out alerts so daily we process half a

605
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:10,290
million alerts a day on average

606
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,710
obviously there is a lot of rubbish and

607
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:15,000
if we weren't able to process that and

608
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,369
we need they wouldn't be able to know

609
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,089
what is exactly is what is going on

610
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:23,760
there with all that information so we

611
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:27,089
have frightened that deals with that

612
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,899
this is the upper layer and this engine

613
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:33,418
what it does is this activates daily

614
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:36,299
with the most recent attacks that have

615
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:40,279
tried to exploit vulnerabilities and

616
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,710
what we try to do is to analyze if those

617
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,980
alerts that are coming up on our

618
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,869
corporate network are similar to any of

619
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:55,560
those attacks that we are already aware

620
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:57,599
of when this happens when something that

621
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,630
is detected it seems to be a security

622
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:06,150
incident there is a report that goes up

623
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:08,820
to the top left yeah it's the management

624
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,510
console er where all the analysts work

625
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,900
and all the people at the Santa

626
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,940
and there's a safety analyst who takes

627
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,800
that report investigates edge research

628
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,250
assistance and determines if there are

629
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:25,720
any false positives and then we could

630
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:28,630
resolve the incident so all of this is

631
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:34,810
called cesium it's a monitoring system

632
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:37,900
is based on Valencian technology it's

633
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:41,920
the public administration that supplies

634
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:47,020
this for us and we've been using it

635
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:49,900
right since the start of the center have

636
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:55,720
the early alert Center we have vigilance

637
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:59,260
on open lines and we have events so that

638
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,120
you know what you are if that works and

639
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,910
blinds so that you can differentiate

640
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:11,290
between different services and analyze

641
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:14,950
the behavior of attackers going on from

642
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:16,509
dictatorship we've detect something and

643
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,669
we've determined if it's a or whether

644
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:22,410
it's is a false positive then we have a

645
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:26,890
response surface I'd like to highlight

646
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:31,600
the fact that the response services all

647
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:36,580
the stages of an incident until it is

648
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:39,430
contact detected contained and at the

649
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:42,190
end the feedback that we get from our

650
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:45,250
prevented systems and the lessons that

651
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:48,550
are learned from each incident it's a

652
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:50,710
matter of finding out learning and what

653
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:54,280
the patterns of the attack have been and

654
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:59,110
we feed that back into our system into

655
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:02,200
our defense system the incidents that we

656
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:04,150
have dealt with since we have been

657
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,450
working there have been more than 10,500

658
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:10,300
and more than hundred and fifty of these

659
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,390
have been critical ones most of these

660
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:16,900
have been fraud

661
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:19,670
malicious or related to e

662
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:23,960
we have been able to intervene quickly

663
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:26,420
and what we do is when there's a very

664
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,600
relevant incident and when it's moving

665
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:32,690
very fast then what we do is that we

666
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:36,319
have a group of analysts security and

667
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:38,600
they go to that organism to that local

668
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,030
government building and they deal with

669
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,190
that we have a forensic analysis

670
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,750
services that we also set up when there

671
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:48,620
is an incident that we have to

672
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:51,560
investigate in detail and with the

673
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:54,589
analysis of the incidents that have come

674
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,960
up recently we've done that and we've

675
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:00,530
worked alongside the civil guard in

676
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:03,140
these incidents and this forensic

677
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:09,710
analysis service is very complex and

678
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:11,629
detailed we coordinate with all the

679
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,370
different other groups of work in terms

680
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:19,460
of the containment and resolution of

681
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:21,950
these issues so this is what is si si si

682
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:27,470
RT group who do in terms of detection

683
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:30,470
and response but I also need to talk

684
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:34,299
about collaboration and exchanging

685
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:38,089
information you will have realized that

686
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:40,870
threats have increased incredibly over

687
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:43,790
the last few years and therefore

688
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:51,589
collaboration strategies also need to be

689
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:54,710
complex research has increased its

690
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:56,180
presence in terms of the response to

691
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,880
incidents and we believe that

692
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:03,890
collaboration is essential and sharing

693
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:09,220
information as well since 2009 we have

694
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:12,920
been part of the of a European forum

695
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:17,509
there are about 400 different entities

696
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:22,100
involved across Europe and we part of

697
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:25,590
the forum for response to incident

698
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:29,400
and we are founder for members of the

699
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:32,550
group here in Spain they search yes that

700
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,000
was such up in 2009 at the time we were

701
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:40,890
only six entities but now I believe we

702
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:45,690
are over 40 and we were selected last

703
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:50,509
year to leave the course we collaborate

704
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:50,510
with the two main three certs in Spain

705
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,230
there is one entity that's the reference

706
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,540
for the public administration and but

707
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,790
there's also an entity that covers the

708
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:07,830
citizens and smaller medium-sized

709
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:10,860
enterprises and in the coming days we

710
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:14,670
will formalize a collaboration with

711
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:17,730
these entities and as you know it is

712
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:20,550
focused on citizens and companies we

713
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,920
also belong to other groups and it is

714
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:26,910
very important to hide lives that we

715
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,360
have a stronger collaboration with our

716
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:34,140
police forces and security forces

717
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:40,920
especially with the Civil Guards what

718
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:44,160
did you give you numbers here the Union

719
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:47,040
idea of our activity we have dealt with

720
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,430
some ten hundred five hundred security

721
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:55,759
issues of which over a hundred worth of

722
00:40:50,430 --> 00:41:00,180
high security criticality we've had over

723
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,940
four million visits also were not very

724
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:06,180
big but we are your reference center and

725
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:09,330
in the region that is all from me I just

726
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:12,149
wanted to let you know that we are here

727
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:15,299
aren't your service that you work a lot

728
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:17,460
we work a lot so that we're all safe on

729
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,270
the internet that's it I don't know if

730
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,270
you have any questions

731
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,200
thank you very much for your

732
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:42,100
presentation it's been very interesting

733
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:46,759
I would like to know how you deal with

734
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:48,500
offer and demand between schools and

735
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,480
your workshops because you mentioned

736
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:54,320
that there was a pilot I understand with

737
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,140
the regional educational or thority but

738
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,850
how does it work for the following

739
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:03,350
stages how do they get in touch with you

740
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:06,290
do you have yeah I'm going to go

741
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:10,970
backwards on my presentation because I

742
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:14,890
think because I think I have here how

743
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:24,549
you can to collaborate it's true we had

744
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:26,839
pilot stage sent a letter to all

745
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:29,630
educational centers be it public or

746
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:33,530
private in the region offering them the

747
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:37,040
possibility to enroll and take that

748
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:40,160
enormous this plan the thing is the

749
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,050
center directors have to ask for it they

750
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,029
can do it through OBC which is a

751
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:47,840
platform they know very well they can

752
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:50,570
send an email to sister CV that's all

753
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,970
they can give us a call but as I was

754
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:55,970
saying the center directors have to

755
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:59,500
request it but there have been cases

756
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:02,930
where a parent has been to have to his

757
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:06,260
daughter's school and has seen that they

758
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:08,540
have this session but sons they didn't

759
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:10,070
have it so he that they have called and

760
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:13,520
asked for information so we do not

761
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:15,890
discriminate and the only thing is that

762
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,390
we I mean the spots are filling up

763
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:21,680
really quickly

764
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:23,210
we have 2.5 teams who work on these

765
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,250
trainings because we have people who are

766
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:28,060
know 100% working on this so as long as

767
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:33,170
we have slots available we are happy to

768
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:35,779
do this on every school yeah answered my

769
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:38,180
questions thank you very much but there

770
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,580
was another question do you do you apply

771
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:42,190
some filters depending

772
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:45,730
on demand depending on the number of

773
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,350
students that can attend no it doesn't

774
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:51,100
really matter doesn't matter the kind of

775
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:53,110
school be it private public I think

776
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,799
there was own there has only been a case

777
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:59,560
where in on the same day three centers

778
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,420
wanted to have the training but we only

779
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,160
have two groups and the ones who had

780
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:07,060
already done it the previous year was it

781
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:09,670
well can you not find another date well

782
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:13,060
if there is a conflict we didn't have an

783
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:16,450
algorithm Witter manually but we do talk

784
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:18,670
to the schools even if the students are

785
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:22,689
not the same because obviously those who

786
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:24,760
were doing the second year secondary

787
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:27,040
education you have new students second

788
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,920
year this year but obviously depending

789
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,600
on the school's facilities and the

790
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,790
number of students if there aren't too

791
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,740
many you can have the two age groups

792
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:38,620
together but obviously you shouldn't

793
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:40,959
have over forty people on the same work

794
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:43,710
because otherwise that's way too many so

795
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,610
that's more or less be at capacity

796
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:48,610
requirements and there are schools who

797
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:50,470
are asking us to go there for three days

798
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:52,660
because the really big centers and

799
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,220
they're in Ag and they say so was where

800
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:56,589
they're you know sort of doing two one

801
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:59,049
two three and so we can have this for

802
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:02,800
everyone's who are quite reasonable you

803
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:07,060
have the calendar the timeline our

804
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:10,930
planning there but we do try to adapt to

805
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:13,500
every school thank you was there another

806
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,500
question over here

807
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:33,280
there was someone over there who wanted

808
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:38,299
to ask a question thank you very much

809
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:41,030
you have mentioned about gender violence

810
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:44,180
but I'm not very sure in which context

811
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,920
you do work yes you haven't gone in

812
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:49,549
depth with that because today we were

813
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:52,369
talking about underage people mostly but

814
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:54,829
we have worked in this area first of all

815
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:57,380
we got in touch with the Institute for

816
00:45:54,829 --> 00:46:02,210
women instituto de la mujer we explained

817
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:04,940
our idea and it was through them well

818
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:08,599
actually they were the ones who called

819
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:17,599
upon women victims that go to their

820
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:20,150
Senators also women who live monitoring

821
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,150
in houses because they didn't have

822
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:28,670
enough resources and they live in foster

823
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:30,800
homes and so it the Institute for women

824
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:33,200
was the one who got in touch or Chapel

825
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:38,060
who channeled the requests we started

826
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:41,149
working only women but there was also

827
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:43,009
people who work with them and were

828
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:44,750
coming and they said well we would be

829
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:47,690
interested in knowing a bit more because

830
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:52,550
we could help them better so what we did

831
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:54,349
is have workshops on the same day or on

832
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:57,829
the following day which were a bit more

833
00:46:54,349 --> 00:47:01,400
technical and more practical so that the

834
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:03,890
people who work with them which is

835
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,760
usually women but so that they knew that

836
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:10,609
you know once they see some things they

837
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:15,020
can help women they have told us about

838
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:20,089
cases where women are threatened online

839
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:23,480
the threatener lives with them so they

840
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:27,670
see that they have a thread through

841
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,829
whatsapp and they make and the person

842
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:34,010
that the man makes them delete it so we

843
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:34,890
show them how to share it to someone who

844
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,020
is

845
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:39,150
close to them and then talita so that

846
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,370
the husband doesn't get angry so that

847
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,900
once you sit down with them and see the

848
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:45,120
different cases then you come up with

849
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,500
more solution so that's why I was saying

850
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,779
at the beginning that it's not the same

851
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:53,190
training someone who's been victim of

852
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:55,380
sexist violence because everyone has

853
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:57,810
different objectives and then the

854
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,940
technology the women who are victims of

855
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:02,850
violence use is very different to that

856
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:04,740
of teenagers for example we didn't know

857
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:09,720
for example is that women who live in

858
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:13,049
foster homes use contact or dating

859
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:16,709
networks where they would expose some

860
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:20,220
pictures with pictures of at work with

861
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:23,580
children of women who lived with them or

862
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:26,040
they used dating networks that are

863
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:30,890
filled with harasses so you have to

864
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:33,240
study every case and I don't want to

865
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:34,589
talk too much because I only have one

866
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,200
more minute yes we have channels

867
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:46,470

868
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:48,870
women thank you any more questions not

869
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:51,299
bad not bad I think it doesn't seem to

870
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:54,930
be any more questions well I hope this

871
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:57,510
is scary but your reference point is and

872
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:59,190
