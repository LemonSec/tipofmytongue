decades that have preceded it II and it

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:59,579
wasn't why did you make us tsunami they

7
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,369
are forgetting that humanity has become

8
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,610
what we are today as we have developed

9
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,030
and discovered geography medicine in a

10
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,310
science porgy only because scientists

11
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:16,599
within humans we are

12
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,760
Lloris so what especially you know who

13
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:24,910
this person is and of course it's radar

14
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:32,829
when the picture of him as a man but in

15
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:35,530
the way when Darwin 24 for five years is

16
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:41,739
navigating and studying fossils and the

17
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:42,580
fans but then we became theory when he

18
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:47,200
was young

19
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:50,410
youngest comes just like ours and why do

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,679
we go to mark but because we keep on

21
00:02:50,410 --> 00:03:00,269
exploring because our DNA is the

22
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:05,200
exploration feeling going forward and

23
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:09,940
Blanche are who seem to be here GQ

25
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:18,010
climb volcanoes mountains thousands and

thousands of South America without

27
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:31,149
oxygen bodies being adventurous and they

28
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,298
work for science which is exactly what

29
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,690
astronauts do in the spacial in the

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,579
International Space Station's sometimes

31
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,340
they even use themselves on a skinner

32
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:46,299
please in the name of science in the

33

name of progress all our armies right

34
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:55,030
now in the world is a known instant in

35
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:57,370
documents as well almost breaking all

36
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:01,840
the paradise your paradigms of the 20th

37
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:04,269
century almost TV being is a ten twenty

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,540
years ago we couldn't even imagine for a

39
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:12,010
faint blue for example estamos in with

40
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:19,539
findings molecules even at a subatomic

41
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:22,110
molecule left level will discover the

42
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,349
typical nano structure information

43
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,890
evaluations the

44
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,780
I've seen before is actually invested in

45
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:34,030
certain components so what does this

46
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:35,919
mean it means it's always been yeah it

47
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:41,169
was no now could we have this technology

48
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:45,160
that we can see it see around us the lab

49
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:48,820
under Salone rest of the universe mean

50
00:04:45,160 --> 00:05:01,290
we've secured all the units then now we

51
00:04:48,820 --> 00:05:05,350
can study entomology know we have only

52
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,780
classically 20% they look all the

53
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,180
insects there are in the world that is

54
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:17,739
amazing there are billions and trillions

55
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:21,760
of species all around us mr. Yeager in a

56
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,520
mundo pharmacopoeia when one noon

57
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:32,230
embrace accompany Bonilla the serrano

58
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:37,030
wanted to develop an image about 2.5

59
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:38,860
million dollars an afternoon was most of

60
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,280
the patrons this baby that was trying to

61
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:45,160
register for always rejected by

62
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,950
regulated oh but it's not the case now

63
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:53,470
you see and Latin even begin to account

64
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:59,289
we've had to analyze the 19th the what

65
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:07,990
we do now we use artificial in former

66
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:10,990
companies either working with IBM's with

67
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,020
smaller companies to use their platform

68
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,480
and what do they do actually in our

69
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,609
scientific Institute we have a couple of

70
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:24,620
projects that are actually developing

71
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:27,530
drugs what we do is they create similar

72
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,410
and digital software well the cuesta and

73
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:35,210
you know it has all zeros because the

74
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:39,020
mood doing it only similar and

75
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:41,479
artificial intelligence is a to how come

76
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:47,150
we now have a disposal because the world

77
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:52,760
has become a digital world no not only

78
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:56,419
no it's very easy medicine now we're

79
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,880
starting to see how therapy works for

80
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,490
chemo because we have digital eyes every

81
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,070
single scientific process both in

82
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,400
Pharmacopeia and in those medicine so

83
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:10,520
but not only that we are actually

84
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,030
starting to see now really exactly how

85
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:29,060
the human body works very recently ten

86
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:31,309
years ago brain activity possibility'

87
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,990
lies everything beyond starting to

88
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:39,530
understand it was neither or right side

89
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,300
of the brain the brain is entity in

90
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,849
action not only that we even have

91
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:48,410
nearest in our intestines even more in

92
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:50,719
our intestines then in the brain and we

93
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:55,160
know that the our immunological system

94
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,180
is actually bad so medicine from the 19

95
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,370
and 20 centuries is changing completely

96
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,520
because we have to do everything and now

97
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:08,210
we can actually see the reality e

98
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,250
there's the noise in the next five to

99
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,430
ten years

100
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:19,000
the agnostic diagnosis is going to be

101
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:24,220
done in my machine why because the human

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,420
body is constantly degrading the worst

103
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:31,050
descendants that we have and when I'm

104
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,969
asked why I gave a very clear example

105
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,940
magicians and people who teaches with

106
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:40,900
cuts we don't have to just wait they

107
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:48,670
should be they pull our leg all the time

108
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:51,430
wonderful when you go to the doctor has

109
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:54,640
to check 10,000 pictures my father's

110
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,620
cancer indicators in your lot and not to

111
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,439
be able to do with their human eyes are

112
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:03,970
going to lose and eight I can actually

113
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:07,900
detect a millimeter of change in the

114
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:13,810
sample so machines will be the helpers

115
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:20,199
of proportion then our skills allow us

116
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:24,579
to go I'm trying to change the slider

117
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:36,820
it's not working now it kind of sits

118
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:42,370
does mommy thought that is being treated

119
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:44,130
in radical way neither Kimio therapy no

120
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:50,650
rages there we've been working on

121
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:58,000
people's DNA and modifying the DNA so

122
00:09:50,650 --> 00:10:09,339
how do we do this using a software

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:12,339
hardware your cyber security with those

124
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:15,870
tools but I guess we have if she is sick

125
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:21,460
or avoid in hacking

126
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:23,770
changes to just protecting a company's

127
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:30,040
data with a fire well it's not about

128
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:32,439
that much larger extent porky a most

129
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:42,010
women why are we in Montes intelligent

130
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:52,060
machines computational that our

131
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:54,970
biologically no way to see the realities

132
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,369
and that is why for the reason that is

133
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,590
why we're doing this I'm delivering food

134
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,530
to no interest nests no so much in

135
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,770
earthly chair it's not going to be about

136
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:10,689
intelligence but about initially be a

137
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:12,730
huge difference between merely they

138
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,790
don't have an information being able to

139
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:18,970
computer like because mission means

140
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:23,079
having information that allows you to

141
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,970
act as cognition is knowing what not to

142
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,760
do not only knowing thanks for knowing

143
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:29,410
how to react to ghost realities or to

144
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,000
those challenges everything that's

145
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:36,219
coming our way every single will want to

146
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,470
see if you because then the cyber

147
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,920
security is not just about protecting

148
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:45,000
like a log around castles you know give

149
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,219
us something that we won't have to do to

150
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,770
foresee potential challenges if we do

151
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,480
sort of business if we create this kind

152
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,270
of slack phone we have to be intuitive

153
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,240
creative we have to go forward you have

154
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,750
to look into different scenarios and may

155
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,750
come your way

156
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,190
can someone over a lot of them who knows

157
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,550
my computer a little bit because I just

158
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,950
think it's receiving my signal sorry

159
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:20,420
now this is one of the images I was

160
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:25,970
talking yes was a waiver our nearest

161
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:30,170
honest in-flight up and it's becoming

162
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:37,430
lovely knowledge that's become to come

163
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:44,589
together these images only seven years

164
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:48,140
ago one though you're when do you think

165
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,940
do it from a new order piece I'm I

166
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:56,000
specialize in XIV learning which is the

167
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:58,940
way our brain images many of us who work

168
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,550
in deep learning have learned that the

169
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:07,310
algorithms in our brain absolutely

170
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:09,620
amazing human brain does not in this

171
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:13,550
technological and vegetal era we're

172
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:16,490
going to start growing we're going to

173
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:19,810
grow with technologies with we're going

174
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:22,970
to start talking about pros realities

175
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:32,300
one the second when we created the

176
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:34,010
famous V gaming industry we're going to

177
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:38,900
start using hey look and you know what

178
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:40,910
the best users well actually our army

179
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,970
speakers right now when there's

180
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:48,680
something really really difficult from

181
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:53,330
human hands if you train it if you train

182
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:57,469
it in a virtual way then you will see an

183
00:13:53,330 --> 00:14:02,000
increase in the success of complicated

184
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:06,860
surgery so VR is now in hospitals it's

185
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,840
the guy's helmet and a helmet daughter

186
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:16,030
and it catches pictures it fills it

187
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:16,030
gathers information and plays it

188
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:21,430
engineers who go well right and

189
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,069
obviously when you start walking around

190
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,739
the worksite you will need your hands to

191
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,980
hang on to something instead of having

192
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,899
to carry us both asked to take naps this

193
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:38,019
helmet is actually for sale and I'll see

194
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:42,339
you so we're starting to feel both from

195
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:47,970
a software and a hardware so this is all

196
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:51,899
about data have to be protected because

197
00:14:47,970 --> 00:15:01,209
whole and they have to be legitimized

198
00:14:51,899 --> 00:15:06,790
when do we need the communication in the

199
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:09,579
last 20 30 years satellites but this is

200
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:21,420
going to increase anymore follow the

201
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:26,939
space industry launching nano satellites

202
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:29,800
Wi-Fi signal broadband high band in

203
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,350
deserts in mostly and places where

204
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:39,670
before there was not even 3G or 4G or

205
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:43,990
anything so the world is a huge area

206
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:47,979
filled with spatial infrastructure and

207
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:54,760
potentially not only through patience by

208
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:57,550
even a sir in the Japanese were all

209
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:05,380
trying to establish human viruses in the

210
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:09,519
moon is 2025 so this picture is no

211
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:16,829
jewelry is no address film the

212
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:16,829
conceptual some very big chance

213
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,830
state now we have around the country

214
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:28,300
Murphy said this is a reality imagine

215
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:31,399
the amount they said the go-between

216
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:34,880
special infrastructure Louis UVs is

217
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:41,769
going to be your work is not only about

218
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:41,769
protecting a company so

219
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:52,610
speed in the world digital

220
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:55,190
transformation grow linearly or

221
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,700
horizontally it has grown exponentially

222
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:02,630
and what happens with exponential speed

223
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:06,679
in well it's going to almost become

224
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:12,650
vertical very very soon that's what do

225
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:17,689
you get when you rock it and 2020

226
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:19,880
where is 2020 exactly what 2010 and from

227
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:22,880
that there's going to be this and

228
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:27,860
turning points in human T is going to

229
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:31,690
stop both cases and that is why we need

230
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:35,178
to establish the foundation size with

231
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:38,919
security was guarantee of success

232
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:42,980
just just give you an example blow

233
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:46,730
everything thousands of little pieces in

234
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:49,660
this nightmare length and commissary

235
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:54,230
we used to measure progress in science

236
00:17:49,660 --> 00:18:00,260
numerating clean numbers three and five

237
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:03,919
evil and given new business models well

238
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:07,760
boys it's only made us a first order fan

239
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:14,210
fourteen years of the 21st so most we

240
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:16,220
when old and then files in 19th century

241
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,890
so in fourteen years we did as much as

242
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,410
we boarded one hundred years before

243
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,610
because

244
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:25,410
I'm starting to innovate exponential

245
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,110
speed this is not stopping this is

246
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:31,380
growing continuously but a good and just

247
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:34,679
like you everyone realizes in today's

248
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:44,730
literal theone e innovation and me

249
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:56,220
sometimes I don't think invention that

250
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:56,700
really made humanity go oh no I mean the

251
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,790
wheel

252
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,490
so don't go back to the beginning so

253
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:09,000
what is the destruction of the 20th

254
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:14,820
century this one here is that square so

255
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:20,960
is it buzz it is something really funny

256
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:28,520
as you can see it's gotta keep that

257
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:32,250
maybe you so how was this wheel design

258
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,860
where did it come from with us the

259
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,660
people who designed this wheel looked at

260
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:42,750
how snakes

261
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:45,300
move over rocks and how sharks move and

262
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,970
they go don't go in a straight line its

263
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:53,340
movement that's come from nature itself

264
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:57,300
and it's been used in this wheel so

265
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,510
there are two things we have an

266
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:04,379
increased capacity to think about the

267
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:10,620
university but more importantly these

268
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:14,790
young people have invented this wheel we

269
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:17,760
weren't scared to go in and change

270
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:21,020
things and change something that there

271
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,750
had already been invented the wheel

272
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:28,440
that's the attitude that's innovation in

273
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,150
the 21st century that's saying something

274
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,190
can be in

275
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:38,700
it's even saying we can even change

276
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:45,080
something completely so where do these

277
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:49,200
things actually come from each

278
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:53,419
transformation in society has begun with

279
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:57,270
a very very small factor conversation

280
00:20:53,420 --> 00:21:00,150
big companies huge companies that have

281
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,850
existed began with just a very small

282
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:05,760
picture with a comment that year that

283
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:09,199
was made to somebody and that grows and

284
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:15,660
grows and grows into something huge

285
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:20,550
so digitalization of the world began on

286
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:27,480
the 30th of April in 1993 as you can see

287
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:30,930
written up down in red pen pages were

288
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:37,230
sent by facts to the American Banker I

289
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:41,540
worked in Zurich and what's this facts

290
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:45,720
exactly it was sent

291
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:49,440
regarding nucleus dirty but it was about

292
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:51,480
when internet was created what it was

293
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,210
telling us universities and banks and

294
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,530
all the collaborating parties was that

295
00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:00,510
ugly last we could use this we could use

296
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:06,990
the servers that had been set up around

297
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:11,790
the world and if we were to set up web

298
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:13,110
sites using HTML then didn't have

299
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,530
anything to do with that

300
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,399
the only thing went wrong then they

301
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:22,680
didn't want to have anything to do with

302
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:26,750
that so the beginning of internet were

303
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:30,240
two pages sent by bureaucrats

304
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:32,570
it wasn't the team berners-lee the huge

305
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,650
inventor they didn't send it it was the

306
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:40,950
administration that sent it when those

307
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:42,580
two pages arrived they came out just

308
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:47,290
beside me

309
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:50,710
I took them to the head of IT and really

310
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:55,060
had alphabets I was very surprised I'm

311
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:57,160
going to keep that and just think about

312
00:22:55,060 --> 00:23:01,560
how the world has changed since those

313
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:05,110
two pages came out of the fax machine

314
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:12,280
everything changes based on a very small

315
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:14,050
fact big changes start like that so that

316
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,280
you can see the huge capacity that

317
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:22,450
humanity this is a very curious fact

318
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:25,750
when Henry Ford created the model that

319
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:29,910
was sent out and manufactured in huge

320
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:32,500
quantities on the fifth avenue new york

321
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,890
at the time it was just on a road

322
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:40,240
covered width and full of fur horses and

323
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:43,000
carts so you can see the same picture

324
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:49,810
same place and look at the difference

325
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:54,520
all of a sudden nobody has this was in

326
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:57,850
less than ten years so when people ask

327
00:23:54,520 --> 00:24:00,700
me about what will happen to society

328
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:04,300
when artificial intelligence really

329
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:07,330
grows and I say it will be everywhere

330
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,760
it's around us and it's been there for a

331
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:14,230
long time

332
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:16,960
we need to benefit from it because we've

333
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:20,920
been digitalising data for many many

334
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,630
years when I began in the industry in

335
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:27,940
the mobile industry we had

336
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:32,530
geolocalization on GPS but we forgot it

337
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:35,260
to digitalization images sound via

338
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:40,300
sensors and take the information from a

339
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:42,129
room everything is digital nowadays so

340
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:47,169
everything can be measured and

341
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:51,059
everything needs to be protected we've

342
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:55,499
been saving data forever

343
00:24:51,059 --> 00:25:01,879
and this before the Roman area within

344
00:24:55,499 --> 00:25:03,230
saving take two from him stone wheels to

345
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:07,139
pendrives

346
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:10,230
the one that Edward Snowden it took out

347
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:14,580
of the of sinawe and it was taken by the

348
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:18,990
journalists thousands of pieces of data

349
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:23,490
included in that they say that it's the

350
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:28,080
oil of this century it's not crude oil

351
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:30,809
in a barrel its value of data it's not

352
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,869
crude data it's what you do with that

353
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:39,928
data how you analyze it and what you see

354
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:45,119
make of them thankfully now that we have

355
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:48,019
mega computers we can put goodness knows

356
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:51,330
how much information and data into them

357
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:54,119
and these machines and this machine that

358
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:59,369
will be launched next year by China

359
00:25:54,119 --> 00:26:03,418
Omega power this machine will be able to

360
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:08,249
analyze a billion billions and millions

361
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:10,850
of data in an instant seconds in a

362
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:10,850
second

363
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:18,169
so if why do we need its machines of

364
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:26,669
this this kind its industries that need

365
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:30,389
calculations of this type meteorology if

366
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:33,929
you're going to dig down to get oil out

367
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:35,668
what is the potential for that this is

368
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:39,509
the thousands and thousands bits of data

369
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:42,740
that you need very quickly logistics is

370
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:46,190
another area and it has a lot of

371
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:50,309
potential in terms of these calculations

372
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:54,900
and of course the birth of the super

373
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:57,270
machines the quantum machine oh sorry

374
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,820
so to give you an idea of what these

375
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:02,580
machines are these are 21st century

376
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,990
machines they're far better than the

377
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:10,370
ones that can be for because the quantum

378
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:14,730
machine is based on the paradigm of

379
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:15,479
particles so noise just not one or a

380
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:17,910
zero

381
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,720
it's a Maggie now this machine can be

382
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:25,559
here one oszi zero or it can be both at

383
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:29,940
the same time because atoms can be in

384
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:33,720
two places at once and what do we need

385
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:37,860
quantum machines for this year at last

386
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:42,990
they have seen been some publications to

387
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:47,100
research projects and there's been a use

388
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:52,980
of a quantum machine to remodel in a

389
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:55,740
project organized by IBM there were some

390
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,309
algorithms from deep learning increase

391
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:02,580
the capacity of the machine so it's in

392
00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:04,950
the perfect moment right now all the

393
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:08,639
engineering entities are helping one

394
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:15,150
another project it's still a research

395
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:19,230
project and I can confirm IBM love for

396
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:22,830
any company any university to make use

397
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:26,520
of these machines it's a quantum machine

398
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,470
in Munich another one in Jersey and to

399
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,450
where we'll be going to with this well

400
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:35,640
we really don't know there's huge

401
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:38,970
potential here big data is no longer big

402
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:44,280
it's an ocean of data because everything

403
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:47,700
is digital intelligence will continue to

404
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,950
increase in the 50s when we started

405
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,780
programming machines and helping the

406
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:58,980
telothane work and using statistics

407
00:28:53,780 --> 00:29:01,920
began with statistics then following

408
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,380
this in the 60s 70s we had this

409
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,220
different scenarios

410
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:10,500
if we get into this region to sell what

411
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,520
could happen different scenarios the

412
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:19,020
Machine looks at it and who uses

413
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:23,070
scenario planning the oil companies they

414
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:28,440
are the kings of this and shale has the

415
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:31,250
best scenario planning and it's also

416
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,720
been used in cement by governments to

417
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,580
where should they put roads whether they

418
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:42,299
need to put motorways that small

419
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:47,240
scenario planning realized that take the

420
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:51,350
human-machine in the 1990s window

421
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:54,210
emerson began with him algorithm

422
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,770
regarding people who had bought a book

423
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:58,740
would buy another one

424
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:01,309
it's a collaboration algorithm it's what

425
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,309
it's called

426
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:09,330
at that point it was when people

427
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:13,289
realized that a machine knows what I

428
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:17,658
like but machine uses thousands and

429
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:17,658
thousands of variables it's not magic

430
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:28,650
magic it just uses the data so where are

431
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:31,350
we heading to when machines work in an

432
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:35,360
autonomous manner without human input in

433
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:38,639
software and say around the world a

434
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,428
machine tells a pilot which gate they

435
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,620
have to go to person who couldn't do

436
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:48,990
that they would go crazy it's done by

437
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:51,360
machine they're also used to think one

438
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:56,940
of the things that we do in the field of

439
00:30:51,360 --> 00:31:00,750
markets and user behavior is to predict

440
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:04,590
an algorithm so we train them to predict

441
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:07,130
algorithms until they reach a point when

442
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,990
the machine is

443
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:14,100
aware of the context and what would go

444
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:20,429
on in a given context enjoy that no

445
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:23,730
money that fact humanity in 2020 in this

446
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:26,690
new decade will compute less with their

447
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:30,570
their own brains and they'll have to use

448
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:37,289
more abstract intelligence intuition

449
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:41,220
creativity sociability teamwork thinking

450
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:44,039
in a different kind of way calculations

451
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:56,100
will be done by a machine that's there's

452
00:31:44,039 --> 00:32:00,600
no there's nothing wrong with that when

453
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:03,570
he did you know beeps the IBM machine I

454
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:06,600
got to know him last year in Copenhagen

455
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:10,049
in an artificial intelligence a event

456
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:13,860
he's a lovely person we should read his

457
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:15,960
books he said nobody remembers the first

458
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,809
year when I actually won but it's true

459
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,929
nobody nobody remembers that we all

460
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:25,019
remember how he lost and it was a

461
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:30,950
disaster for Humanity the machine has

462
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:30,950
been able to beat man a huge paranoia

463
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:37,918
thank goodness he won because the

464
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,739
machine is there to serve us and to work

465
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:47,610
for us we are not designed for that kind

466
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:50,700
of mind for that kind of computing when

467
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:54,658
you use a machine to analyze data you

468
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:59,370
have a huge menu many many classified

469
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:02,700
algorithms in libraries with all their

470
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:04,768
different names random forest I don't

471
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,059
know if any of you work in artificial

472
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:13,440
intelligence when you really want a

473
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:16,080
machine to get its full potential you

474
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,309
teach that machine to think with a

475
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,918
logical mind

476
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:24,330
it's not mathematics mathematics works

477
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:26,889
and that's fine but this is all about

478
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:31,809
something else this is where dangerous

479
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:36,340
heart comes in a machine is going from

480
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:39,009
Syria to 1200 we have to look at what

481
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:49,090
sure the machine is learning and that

482
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:51,869
it's not using false realities the way

483
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:55,809
in which we program a machine

484
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:57,759
incentivizes it to explore how do we

485
00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:00,428
scudder things because we're explorers

486
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:06,969
and machines work in the same way is the

487
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:08,770
same function sometimes machines explore

488
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:12,339
in the wrong kind of way they go in the

489
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:14,469
wrong direction we have to check them

490
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:18,520
all the time there's no corruption in

491
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:22,649
the train of thought it needs to be a

492
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:27,969
positive result and not a false positive

493
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:29,859
why am I saying this this is a photo

494
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:33,250
that was sent to me by British retal

495
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:39,159
petroleum a great British company it's

496
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:41,500
all data humans can't work can't

497
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:46,779
visualize multi realities that's why we

498
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:49,179
need machines so the motor movie mobile

499
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:53,049
companies so a box I can for example

500
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:55,690
when we're designing a car they don't

501
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:57,819
allow us to use the wind tunnel in

502
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:04,180
actual fact because it's very very

503
00:34:57,819 --> 00:35:06,940
expensive we do it using simulators when

504
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:12,089
you're using simulators you can go above

505
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:15,579
and beyond we can push things to their

506
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:17,440
limit in terms of dynamics and you can

507
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:19,869
go right to the very edge and so you

508
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:27,309
learn much much more with a software

509
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:28,900
program so this is just the cost for

510
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:30,950
this is just the salary of those people

511
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,190
working on it it's all software

512
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:38,240
Vallance what about lost cities so the

513
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:40,880
smart cities of the future is what we're

514
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,490
looking at here this is what happened to

515
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,060
the bear or Boston when he looked into

516
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,589
this

517
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:51,619
he said let's set up a website which we

518
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:54,500
will publish the data of everything that

519
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:55,820
we do from the council how many books

520
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,839
have been published

521
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:03,890
how many people have shot to gun in the

522
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,660
street and all of this data when all of

523
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:13,940
this happened so when companies like

524
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:16,279
uber came to Boston's would go to reach

525
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:18,079
areas and to the city center they won't

526
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:21,980
go into the poorer areas

527
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,470
uber was not going there at all and that

528
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,910
was when the council said tuba if you

529
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:28,339
want to work in Boston you have to go

530
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:31,160
everywhere otherwise I'm not gonna let

531
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:35,119
you continue working here that's the

532
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:37,670
power of data when you've got data you

533
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,950
know what's going on you know what's

534
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:43,730
going on around want you the world is no

535
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:46,640
longer invisible you have reality at

536
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:48,160
your fingertips at the latest good then

537
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:57,230
emotion lies huh

538
00:36:48,160 --> 00:37:00,078
I've been working with in Colorado

539
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:03,589
University a number of students decided

540
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:06,290
to work on a project regarding Jesus and

541
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:07,810
asking how they were expanding where

542
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:17,109
were they getting their money from

543
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:22,960
they took images centers and in 2014

544
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:29,270
they were 86,000 working at the end is

545
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:30,890
30,000 and then down to 15,000 where

546
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:35,520
were they getting the money from they

547
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:39,650
weren't getting it from from digging oil

548
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,650
they were doing was something underhand

549
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:47,460
why hadn't they seen that before because

550
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,550
they hadn't analyzed data in this way in

551
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:56,250
this kind of creative way the world of

552
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:59,810
data opens up many many horizons and I

553
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:05,310
worked in Brazil for the Olympic Games

554
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:07,529
for controlling the masses they do us

555
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,630
all let's hope they don't go and steal

556
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,420
from the people that coming here because

557
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:18,480
that would be a disaster we saw

558
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:21,570
something very curious I said that o

559
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:29,040
people don't remote the luxury of coffee

560
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:32,630
and we finalized the words kiss words

561
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:37,050
and start of instead of numbers or words

562
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:41,119
images what the question was how to

563
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:44,340
simply understand the concept of luxury

564
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,560
however and you know comparison with

565
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,560
some team Brazil people in the northern

566
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,240
hemisphere see things in a different way

567
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,540
and that's why they didn't understand

568
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,549
the concept of luxury how come I just

569
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,440
have this I just have this drink and

570
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:02,180
then that's then that's no more look

571
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,180
people didn't understand the concept

572
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:10,740
data can tell you about unknown unknowns

573
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:13,080
things that we don't know about and we

574
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,509
can't even imagine that they exist but

575
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:18,660
they are actually at their working so we

576
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:23,100
say what's going on he can't make head

577
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:25,859
or tail of it so data is has a huge

578
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,900
value and this is the the best thing

579
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:30,740
that a machine can give you in terms of

580
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:35,760
artificial intelligence this is my

581
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:38,419
favorite I did a collaboration this year

582
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:46,549
in the world

583
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:53,710
and as I looked at de Calloway and they

584
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:58,180
asked me about that when you design the

585
00:39:53,710 --> 00:40:01,660
the iron in the inside of the gold steak

586
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:03,890
then you have to talk about and

587
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:06,410
calculate the destruction because when

588
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:11,990
you hit the ball it gets squashed down

589
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:14,990
and then the ball is sent out so I was

590
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:18,078
asked to analyze this data to put the

591
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:21,069
stay tuned to into a program and analyze

592
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,680
what the best way of designing that

593
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:28,299
piece of iron was B and the result was a

594
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,558
cementery irregular have curves and

595
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:31,910
every little bit was different in

596
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,609
everybody thought what are we going to

597
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:36,020
do with this this is pretty strange so

598
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:39,440
these are the ones that we had early

599
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:42,380
fall wasn't when they built the

600
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:47,109
prototype and they started playing gold

601
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,109
they see that the ball would go flying

602
00:40:53,170 --> 00:41:00,260
competitors started using them they

603
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:02,540
realized they that they were other

604
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:07,190
people would need to two years to reach

605
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:10,520
this level so here it's a question of

606
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:13,520
design yes people machines are going to

607
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:17,180
get involved in design I say no this is

608
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:21,859
all about computing 15,000 pieces of

609
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:27,410
data this is the physics this is all

610
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:30,500
about computing it's designing for

611
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:34,420
functionality for use for convenience

612
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:41,480
but not for to make something beautiful

613
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:44,050
the movie comes to class used to working

614
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,510
with innovation we had the connected car

615
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:48,340
you know connected meant really being

616
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:51,580
able to connect your iPad a new phone

617
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:55,600
Wow a fantastic moment so what is the

618
00:41:51,580 --> 00:42:00,009
connected car in our date they're going

619
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:04,569
to be so gorgeous

620
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:07,210
I can't keep that transporter do not

621
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:10,870
have the mission system transport the

622
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:13,180
paradigm cars used to be taking people

623
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:15,790
from one place to another but no this is

624
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:19,000
not the case because the cars of the

625
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:22,090
future want to make your life easier and

626
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,400
what does that mean what it means will

627
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:33,790
have no situational collisions what does

628
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:35,970
that mean sensors that analyzing of the

629
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:39,580
cars are going to start realizing what's

630
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:44,169
coming from the air what's over there do

631
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:46,630
you know the drivers health and so we

632
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:54,280
can tell the car kind of root for me

633
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:57,580
they'll be able one that's traffic even

634
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:03,360
if it means smoothest and what is the

635
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:03,360
least pollution it's the way I was

636
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:16,240
Spanish company and he was saying that

637
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,590
pollution is actually something that's

638
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,049
worrying them and the chance that

639
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:22,390
they're designing and now end up

640
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:24,520
protecting people's health and what is

641
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:26,980
this if they can what you know why am I

642
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:30,990
talking to you about this because in the

643
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:34,900
next 10 years the t's infrastructure

644
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:37,660
concerning traffic are going to be

645
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:40,290
removed Lord and why because these guys

646
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:44,890
are all going to be connected to

647
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:47,110
platforms the car they're building that

648
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,779
kind of drives itself it's being

649
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,200
designed in a paradigm based on the

650
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,819
camera

651
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:59,419
because oh there's a woman coming with a

652
00:43:52,819 --> 00:44:01,849
dog no no no no no traffic platforms

653
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:05,150
will connect why do you think all car in

654
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:10,549
the same will be open you connect you

655
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:13,010
have a login can you log into the car is

656
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:14,420
going to say you're going to login onto

657
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:16,040
a platform and it's going to tell you

658
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,900
where your car is where all the cars are

659
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,690
and thus you are saying because you

660
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:23,359
connected your car will no no well other

661
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:26,119
objects not because it sees them because

662
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,520
it's connected to a platform can you

663
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,880
imagine that me a mountain

664
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:36,430
this is going to generate imagine how

665
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:38,480
important now it will be to protect them

666
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:40,819
corruption so that unhak it doesn't come

667
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,460
in and say so I'm going to create a

668
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:46,069
massive car crash so business is a gold

669
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:49,940
mine Society security and it's the next

670
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:53,808
and even most important so identity

671
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:58,490
right now I'm working on big data

672
00:44:53,809 --> 00:45:00,559
committees looking into the digital

673
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:03,410
citizenship in the sense that you will

674
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:06,170
have a digital now profile and when you

675
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:09,379
goes until website you are who you are

676
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:11,690
and that's a surface your identity in

677
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,579
your personality and why is this

678
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:16,400
important well because there are many

679
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:19,190
companies that aren't focusing on trying

680
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:23,660
to discover whether when you open a bank

681
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:26,210
account in did stolen or if you using

682
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:30,440
your Fitbit or your phone your mobile

683
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:33,010
phone or if you fill your tank in the

684
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:36,470
store plays with electricity or fuel

685
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:39,140
this is the use of digital TV feed

686
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:40,689
values and that means that it is useless

687
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,390
using them and

688
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:44,829
someone hugs to the latent seal a about

689
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:47,500
a government gives you that's the

690
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:49,990
passport and there's an identity label

691
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,819
you create yourself new email and a

692
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:54,098
password thinks that you know yourself

693
00:45:51,819 --> 00:46:00,538
from this biometrics and that would now

694
00:45:54,099 --> 00:46:03,970
listen when you use data layer that IOT

695
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:08,079
objects I'm missing and transmitting so

696
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:09,819
you going to have work for 500,000 years

697
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,150
because commute matching will air will

698
00:46:09,819 --> 00:46:15,880
mean to verify those data are actually

699
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:21,130
the data link they are the better they

700
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:23,470
are true but they have integrity so it

701
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,809
is actually me who is using that cash

702
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:28,359
point with my car is actually mean is

703
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:31,569
using my Fitbit out all that you stay on

704
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:33,730
Tuesday to run around the river and that

705
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:36,190
will be part of who I am and it will be

706
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:39,039
guaranteed because the European Union

707
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:46,410
has the objectives in the next five to

708
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:49,690
10 years to not only a pen or even not

709
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:52,598
but a digital identity for everyone and

710
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:54,849
that digital identity identity will be

711
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:59,109
feed with all the data that I was just

712
00:46:54,849 --> 00:47:02,440
mentioning artificial intelligence grows

713
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:21,660
and your gross it won't be calculating

714
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:24,880
in Space Station what does Simon do

715
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:27,578
where does is to control the emotional

716
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,549
level as my students to help him with

717
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:36,029
tasks through voice activation and it

718
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:38,980
also flows by the way because no human

719
00:47:36,029 --> 00:47:43,119
being to move around the station a robot

720
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:48,279
will be thrashing on to everything to

721
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:50,410
learn how astronauts feel how to connect

722
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:50,750
emotionally with the astronauts and is

723
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,580
the

724
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:58,760
ai Robertson has that mission to learn

725
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:00,710
the emotional changes the person has

726
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,310
been working there with many

727
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:07,700
difficulties stuck in a shoebox for six

728
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:16,869
months and it's a very important project

729
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:20,629
and why because what we are going to I

730
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:27,490
thinking about having a career in cyber

731
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:33,349
security come and visit ESA and come to

732
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:35,899
company hub on earth you cannot even

733
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:38,810
imagine the amount of data that we work

734
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:44,650
with in the space industry and actually

735
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:44,650
in Spain we are leaders we had in an lt1

736
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:54,890
stops building space people under 30 and

737
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:58,310
the best teleport in the world has been

738
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:01,910
awarded to the one in Santander and

739
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:05,080
today as we speak in Seville there are

740
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:07,220
all the representatives of space age

741
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,770
agencies but also the ministers and

742
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:13,669
minister federal gear because they are

743
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:17,300
deciding the features of heroes in space

744
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:20,210
I encourage you to really also consider

745
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:24,680
these special industry for your future

746
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:27,890
thank you very much see I quite gear CI

747
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:31,460
if you have any comments or no questions

748
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:33,319
but something that has made you think at

749
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:35,570
least raise your hand we have

750
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:40,390
microphones at the Simone over that yeah

751
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:40,390
you know Centro a nice intro

752
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:03,040
yeah I would like to say something

753
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:05,830
you have been when you talked about cars

754
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,050
in bosses and you said that they wanted

755
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:09,730
to get rid of all the traffic lights not

756
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:13,810
there was not in Boston there will be in

757
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:19,930
the cities of the future yeah but not

758
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:26,470
everyone will be able to buy a car will

759
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:29,350
be in about 20 years yeah 20 years poor

760
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:33,129
people will still be pool so the won't

761
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:35,920
be able to have access to all the

762
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:37,990
technology that everyone else will have

763
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:42,060
available in 20 years so it will have to

764
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:49,540
be done as well in a way that allows

765
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:51,310
those from working class to access the

766
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:52,870
middle-class of a big can also get

767
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:56,170
access to that technology in turn

768
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:57,850
because as gonna cost yeah but you know

769
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:02,040
the technology is cheaper and cheaper

770
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,040
yeah that's how it works

771
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,779
potential attea just to give you an

772
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:13,300
example when I created my first startup

773
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:16,480
in the year 2000 we have to hire from

774
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:21,010
Sun Microsystems we had to spend eight

775
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:26,050
hundred thousand euros a year to have

776
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:28,960
that service how much does that costs

777
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:30,750
nowadays in an Amazon web server how

778
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,830
much does that cost in the future

779
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:39,220
transport is going to be a massive

780
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:44,819
attention the automotive industry will

781
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:45,939
be created in a small compact very

782
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,540
high-performance

783
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:52,930
so technology is really democratizing

784
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:55,360
because if you look around you when I

785
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:57,609
was your age it was so expensive that it

786
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:00,490
wasn't possible so taking home knology

787
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:04,570
goes hand in hand with democratization

788
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:05,899
and making things accessible to all if

789
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:09,150
one thing is

790
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:12,900
what's gonna come first a car that

791
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:18,289
drives itself or something that helps us

792
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:22,469
drive this one because this is real

793
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:24,660
drive to for car to drive itself and for

794
00:52:22,469 --> 00:52:30,359
all cars to drive itself it will take

795
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:36,420
another 30 that's what the automotive

796
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:36,839
industry is concluding nowadays anyone

797
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:45,709
else

798
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:45,709
yes what is yes good morning my name is

799
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:58,828
we were developing an application of

800
00:52:52,380 --> 00:53:01,829
platform cycle of digital sits for

801
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:04,079
companies and you were talking about

802
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:07,440
Amazon we actually work with Amazon for

803
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:10,079
everything concerning days early you

804
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,849
mentioned how much it costs before and

805
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,539
how much it costs now to have a start

806
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:19,609
value but you mentioned IBM and using

807
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:19,609
the machines because our next step in

808
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:26,339
institutional contents and could you

809
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:28,559
tell me how we can access those IBM

810
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:31,349
machines who we should talk to and what

811
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,599
the next step should be and I think

812
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:42,059
someone is from demonym startups is here

813
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:45,180
and we actually come from many platforms

814
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:46,619
to digitalize values and what you work

815
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:51,078
with in for whatever you need

816
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:54,209
mostly now since full data analytics

817
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:57,509
you've gotten hits as well so the tools

818
00:53:54,209 --> 00:54:00,029
out there even if you want to be

819
00:53:57,509 --> 00:54:03,989
open-source you even have them for free

820
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:05,940
what do you need is to have a machine

821
00:54:03,989 --> 00:54:08,579
that can adapt them or a team that can

822
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:12,150
adapt into your product because they are

823
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:14,789
neutral and you need to adapt them to

824
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:17,509
you business and what happened is that

825
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:23,359
marketing teams have had to create

826
00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:26,029
you famous marketing hacker so that

827
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:29,359
we're creating small algorithms to see

828
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:33,139
how your company's your campaigns work

829
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:35,269
and you're adjusting them until you have

830
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:38,869
zero cost so you get as much as you

831
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:40,879
spend so you need to have a team in your

832
00:54:38,869 --> 00:54:42,679
company that can actually adapt our

833
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,689
tools that already exist to your

834
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:49,159
business whatever your businesses

835
00:54:44,689 --> 00:54:51,888
I mentioned IBM because you know iBM is

836
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:56,179
very interested in people using Watson

837
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:58,249
and quantum collaborating with companies

838
00:54:56,179 --> 00:55:00,679
with project because what they want is

839
00:54:58,249 --> 00:55:03,499
for this machine to actually work it's

840
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:07,659
like a machine and it's part and if you

841
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:07,658
just feed it data then it's worthless

842
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:28,179
hello good morning

843
00:55:28,539 --> 00:55:36,499
this was a great conference thank you

844
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:41,449
very much and I wanted to say that you

845
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:44,479
are a top director was defending women

846
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:50,630
and you have put them to the highest

847
00:55:44,479 --> 00:55:53,089
level really one thing that draws my

848
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:55,399
attention I've seen you giving you a

849
00:55:53,089 --> 00:56:00,558
speech it's a great speech but

850
00:55:55,399 --> 00:56:02,689
everything about mental health and the

851
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:05,019
brain this is something I would I would

852
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:07,959
be really interested

853
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:13,749
is advanced in I live in Madrid and my

854
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:17,379
mother lives in them care home I go to

855
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:20,769
visit her frequently and I saw a man who

856
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:26,289
was in a wheelchair and he was on his

857
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:29,408
own giving a speech businessman someone

858
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:31,959
who has moved to law in the world but it

859
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:34,929
makes me sad to see that this person had

860
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:38,709
Al's I'm and that was his problem and so

861
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:43,029
I hope I really do hope that hey I will

862
00:56:38,709 --> 00:56:46,598
give advances to medicine so that those

863
00:56:43,029 --> 00:56:50,349
people do not have to suffer that kind

864
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:52,749
of diseases well it's been discovered

865
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:56,679
hasn't it I don't know if you know it in

866
00:56:52,749 --> 00:57:01,209
Spain but thanks to stimulation we have

867
00:56:56,679 --> 00:57:03,399
seen that what our thymus does is to

868
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:05,618
create an excess of protein in your

869
00:57:03,399 --> 00:57:09,399
neurons and so near ins

870
00:57:05,619 --> 00:57:12,189
cover these proteins and so the electric

871
00:57:09,399 --> 00:57:14,279
current between synapses does not work

872
00:57:12,189 --> 00:57:16,959
properly and how have we seen that

873
00:57:14,279 --> 00:57:18,699
analyzing thousands and thousands of

874
00:57:16,959 --> 00:57:22,779
pictures and then putting them into

875
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:26,909
simulation programs and so you can see

876
00:57:22,779 --> 00:57:30,549
how proteins actually are dealing to new

877
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:32,979
centers that is why people do not become

878
00:57:30,549 --> 00:57:34,899
silly certainly as they do my remember

879
00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:38,319
because there are no connection cinemas

880
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:40,779
and I teach at Imperial College in

881
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:46,269
London and we're actually carrying out a

882
00:57:40,779 --> 00:57:49,689
lot issues because the data that we have

883
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:52,058
in NorCal is that not not cancer because

884
00:57:49,689 --> 00:57:54,578
cancer is known to be cured but when it

885
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:58,479
comes to mental health that is the

886
00:57:54,579 --> 00:58:00,609
greatest ailment of the 21st century

887
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:02,558
there are many ailments that people have

888
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:05,910
and do not even realize for something in

889
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:10,180
the United States 16

890
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:16,480
taking care or even curing some mental

891
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:18,069
health illness until 26 trillion dollars

892
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:24,930
and on top of that those people have

893
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:31,440
quit jobs so we lost another 94 billion

894
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:35,529
in it is a reality and a is really in

895
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:38,170
hospitals and research seeking to see

896
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:40,960
where our thymus comes from it's

897
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:43,350
actually linked to immunology because

898
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:48,510
people have very poor energy in the

899
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:48,509
intestine do tend to generate

900
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:59,860
functioning management of proteins in

901
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:01,560
their bodies it's incredible we're

902
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:04,090
achieving but this is things to

903
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:15,009
digitalization and to analyzing images I

904
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:20,920
am a cyborg II hello good morning you

905
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:23,910
mentioned not the time now this is when

906
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,190
we have to use projection the

907
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:28,859
potentiality that we have not only

908
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:33,670
artificial intelligence but also

909
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:36,070
managing data at a grade and my question

910
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:39,220
is would it be the time as well to

911
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:42,010
establish limits both moral ethical

912
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:44,560
limits to the use of artificial

913
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:46,690
intelligence because I think so but

914
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:54,009
agency I don't know how it's being

915
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:57,220
regulated directive of data protection

916
00:59:54,010 --> 01:00:00,130
on that gtp our famous gtp our that came

917
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:03,779
it's adding was launched or passed last

918
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:06,760
year welcome in C I'm working with yes

919
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:09,720
subway the principle that everyone who

920
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:12,770
has people states it has to happen

921
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:15,230
legally that is the foundations

922
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:18,710
what I'm working on now and that's why

923
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:21,080
I'm there is not only that companies

924
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:25,040
have our days call us but how they use

925
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:30,319
it against us and so there are several

926
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:32,210
algorithms around them and if they are

927
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,730
wrong there you understand Facebook

928
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:39,890
YouTube Google everywhere that

929
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:43,960
discriminate between people that make

930
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:48,140
you go into little places easygoing

931
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:51,500
for example YouTube's algorithm when you

932
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:53,420
say I want to see TED talk on artificial

933
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,360
intelligence there's a cluster cluster

934
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:58,190
algorithm so the first video is

935
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,290
steadiness artificial intelligence the

936
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:02,420
second one is Ted but it's not

937
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,920
artificial intelligence the third one's

938
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:06,320
does not have anything to do with either

939
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:10,460
and before is something really weird and

940
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:14,800
you think why am I watching this it's

941
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,800
just as the new regulation were working

942
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:19,820
the Union has much more social

943
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:22,570
consciousness example in the United

944
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:26,060
States workers she was had very little

945
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:28,430
very few right so working on a more

946
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:31,250
ethical society and especially in

947
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:35,120
protecting protecting citizens not only

948
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:37,880
on their data being being used but on

949
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:41,839
their data being used against them to

950
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:45,110
influence their opinion is to change the

951
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:47,540
way they speak for example a couple of

952
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:53,480
days ago co-founder Apple co-founder

953
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:57,080
Steve Wozniak tweeted something against

954
01:01:53,480 --> 01:02:00,740
Apple saying how is it possible that my

955
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:02,560
wife and I have ordered the famous Apple

956
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:07,120
pay than your car

957
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:09,900
and my wife I can see has a different

958
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:12,339
algorithm than that that's being used

959
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,840
for me and I said they were seeing

960
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:15,220
different things and he is the

961
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:18,400
cofounders of Apple

962
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:20,830
so he's everywhere and you can you can

963
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,550
feel it more and more nowadays because

964
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:28,150
everywhere where I go I'm trying to see

965
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:31,240
where they're trying to make me see you

966
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:33,640
the truth is that people regular people

967
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:37,000
nowadays do not realize what's going on

968
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:39,370
they didn't stop to think who can I

969
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,210
trust or where can I trust

970
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:46,180
so regulation is definitely in group in

971
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:49,320
European Union we were aiming at having

972
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,319
regulation in a couple of years

973
01:02:53,440 --> 01:03:02,910
[Applause]

974
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:02,910
you
