00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:15,089
hello good afternoon good afternoon to

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,670
all of you that are here and that are

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,449
too also to all of you that are watching

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,460
through the streaming so my presentation

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,740
this afternoon which is threats and

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,220
concealment of Wi-Fi communication in

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,390
urban environments describes a little

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,919
bit all of the things that I want to

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,809
show you today even though the title is

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,360
a little bit long as you know Wi-Fi

12
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,949
technology is widely spread nowadays

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,190
there are a lot of threats a lot of

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,620
attacks so my presentation is a

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,780
educational presentation for you to know

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,780
some of the threats that are right now

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,000
outside maybe you heard of some of them

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,100
but also I want to talk about all the

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,140
other alternative communications that

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,699
have emerged and this is also quite

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,670
educational too if you want to learn how

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:05,789
technology is working but thing you can

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,860
do is experimenting and trying and this

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,590
is how we are going to be able to find

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,840
many things so my presentation will have

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,820
three parts first I'm going to talk

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,640
about the main Wi-Fi network

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,270
architectures nowadays and I'm going to

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,759
focus basically on their working

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,090
characteristics their functionalities

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,409
then my second the second part will be

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:34,380
weaknesses and threats of Wi-Fi wpa2

33
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,420
networks which is which are quite

34
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,979
widespread it widely is pretty - and

35
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,649
they are more secured I will talk about

36
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:45,780
service denial attacks which are very

37
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,479
common attack that may cause a lot of

38
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,200
problems and are very difficult to

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:02:07,940
mitigate and finally in order to get to

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:12,120
know how sorry this network work and

41
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:15,270
works and what we can do I'm going to

42
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,540
show you how to have some more original

43
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:22,080
Wi-Fi connections that are more hidden

44
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,569
and that have also can offer many

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,160
opportunities so regarding wifey net

46
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,829
Wi-Fi networks we are going to talk

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:35,910
about personal Wi-Fi networks which are

48
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:38,900
called wpa2 PSK this type of networks

49
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:42,690
are all the Wi-Fi networks that we have

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:47,459
I mean these are the that we have in our

51
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,920
homes these are the networks that our

52
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,680
service providers are offering us with

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,359
an Ethernet cable and an access point

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,540
which is the device that will allow us

55
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,879
to configure it a wireless network and

56
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:05,549
through which we will be able to access

57
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:09,299
to the Internet personal Wi-Fi networks

58
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,250
work based on access points as offset

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,409
access points are the elements that are

60
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,140
going to connect my wireless network

61
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,540
with my with with the internet these

62
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,079
these access point will be within our

63
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:27,599
Wi-Fi server and as you know every

64
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,659
wireless system may be intercepted there

65
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,619
is no privacy here because every

66
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:36,989
electromagnetic wave is going into

67
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,069
spread throughout this space and if our

68
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,409
Wi-Fi

69
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:42,859
sensor is very sensitive we will be able

70
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:47,670
to gather these waves from farther away

71
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:51,420
this Wi-Fi also can is based on a

72
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:55,319
wireless network network this is based

73
00:03:51,420 --> 00:04:00,018
on a network identification of with our

74
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:06,420
character chain of 32 characters and

75
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:09,110
well this is not a problem but at some

76
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:14,970
points maybe we would we will need to

77
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:17,880
know that then characters will be

78
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,988
repeated or not regarding our households

79
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,569
we will have to

80
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:25,710
we will need to have an authentication

81
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:27,449
point and an access key these

82
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,669
connections are on our side together

83
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,940
this means that no every device can

84
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:36,060
connect to the wireless system there is

85
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,800
something called passphrase phrase which

86
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,090
is a combination of letters or numbers

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:47,819
and specific symbols that could be used

88
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:49,710
as access key through this access key we

89
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:56,639
will see that these are the kids that

90
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:59,000
will encode the communication so also we

91
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:05,520
are using an algorithm here which is

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,990
CCMP algorithm based o a PS and which is

93
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,219
based on an key of encryption of 128

94
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,740
bits these keys are generated through a

95
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,360
process norm name for we handshake which

96
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,520
I will mention later

97
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,570
so which problems do we have with these

98
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,820
wireless networks every user have a

99
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,729
Wi-Fi at point of access so there is a

100
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,659
problem of saturation every wireless

101
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,800
communication need need to send an

102
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:38,310
electromagnetic wave in order to send

103
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,810
data but in this case there are we are

104
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,000
using different frequencies for this

105
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:46,740
communication zone nowadays we are using

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,430
the path of the band of 2.40 hours and

107
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:54,360
sometimes 5g Garriott and what's a band

108
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:58,530
about is a set of frequencies so in the

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,599
case of 2.5 4G guides we have 13

110
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,190
communication channels that could be

111
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:05,190
used in our wireless communication

112
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,530
channels or networks therefore there is

113
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,349
an a problem regarding interpret

114
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,508
interferences if I have 50 neighbors in

115
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,880
my building and we just have 13

116
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:16,770
communication channels some of them may

117
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,750
be repeated and this is why we're having

118
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,549
sometimes interferences that are going

119
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,210
to hinder the functioning of our network

120
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,490
so in order to improve this functioning

121
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,250
Reuters

122
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,220
can choose the channel the wife a

123
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,280
channel that they are going to use for

124
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,620
the wireless communication by looking

125
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:40,489
are the areas where there are the least

126
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,650
number of connections but when there is

127
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,280
when we have a saturation we are going

128
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:49,700
to look for the best spots so our house

129
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,919
can configure eight a fixed point of

130
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,659
access for the Wi-Fi and the rest of the

131
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:58,390
connections are going to try to find the

132
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:01,910
Mist the second best spots in order to

133
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:03,590
not feel so close to our neighbors all

134
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,130
the type of networks that we have are

135
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:09,710
corporate networks that aim to solve a

136
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,250
more complex problem we are going to

137
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,590
have more users of course here than in a

138
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,330
personal set of networks and we are also

139
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,159
going to have a big space in which we

140
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,820
are going to establish our

141
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:27,080
communications this means that for

142
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:29,330
example basic working distances are

143
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,710
about 100-200 meters but if we are

144
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,719
talking about our university campus

145
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:36,950
distances are going to be greater

146
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,020
so this enterprise networks aim to set

147
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:42,500
different point of access in different

148
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:46,580
points of that area to cover greater

149
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,470
areas so if we cannot cover this area

150
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,650
with just one point of access we will

151
00:07:48,470 --> 00:08:00,740
establish several that connects to the

152
00:07:51,650 --> 00:08:03,549
main cable of the company this is this

153
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,870
type of networks offer a more secure

154
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:10,790
connection because we are going to use

155
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:12,950
more specific authentication points in a

156
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:17,830
building all of the users of a house

157
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:20,630
will use the same password or the same

158
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:24,530
authentication but in this enterprise

159
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:30,440
networks is going to use different

160
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:32,720
authentication in its user once the user

161
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,350
has been validated or authenticated

162
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,880
wheels we are going to use two

163
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,600
encryption mechanisms the mechanisms

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,140
that is

165
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,870
key of encryption that may not be

166
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,030
generated based on the same value so the

167
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,120
main difference will be that in

168
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,860
enterprise encryption keys are generated

169
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,280
through random valley which is

170
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,740
individual to each user so therefore

171
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:03,270
they are going to be more resistant

172
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,360
towards attacks also we are going to

173
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:13,350
have less interferences because these

174
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:15,450
networks domain big areas and we are and

175
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,070
they are tailor-made so we are going to

176
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:19,770
be able to really use the number of

177
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,020
interferences it's not the same as the

178
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,400
building full of houses and

179
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,280
neighborhoods that we've mentioned

180
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:30,270
before and then we have public Wi-Fi

181
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,640
networks which are open networks to the

182
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,620
citizens so anyone can access this type

183
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,170
of communication networks for example

184
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:42,210
these is the type of networks that we

185
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:45,569
have in hotels in restaurants or malls

186
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:48,800
and the main characteristic is that they

187
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:54,120
don't do not have any security measure

188
00:09:48,800 --> 00:10:00,750
so the Wi-Fi example symbol as we can

189
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:03,840
see on the screen do not have these the

190
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:07,140
security item so what can we do when we

191
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,960
have an open Wi-Fi network we cannot use

192
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,939
it as freely as other type of networks

193
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,370
but sometimes we are going to use them

194
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,040
so the recommendation would be to use

195
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,740
this type of networks for it

196
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,420
specifically big things you know there

197
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:28,760
to avoid to avoid having security

198
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,760
problems that our conversations are

199
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:37,050
intercepted etc we should use VPI VPNs

200
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,660
in order to protect the communication

201
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,729
but anyway our device is going to be

202
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,250
accessible if someone is sending

203
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:48,510
packages their device is going to

204
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,890
proceed so all the weaknesses of mobile

205
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,140
phone for example could be exploited

206
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,050
when using this type of

207
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,110
why fight networks also I want to

208
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,449
mention the Wi-Fi for you which is a

209
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:04,020
project of the European Union that is

210
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,570
funding the installation of public and

211
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,340
free Wi-Fi networks all over the

212
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:12,150
European Union in Spain for example

213
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,750
there are several projects in cities in

214
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:19,530
which and the EU has decided to cover

215
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:23,490
and to provide Wi-Fi networks in the

216
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:25,709
cities so how are these and network

217
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,990
these three networks there are two

218
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:32,010
phases of deployment in the first

219
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:34,400
deployment we are going to use networks

220
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,140
similar to open Wi-Fi networks without

221
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,510
encryption or authentication and we must

222
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,640
be careful because we must be exposed to

223
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:46,500
any type of attack but there is also a

224
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:51,330
second phase in which these points of

225
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:54,330
access will be modified and will use

226
00:11:51,330 --> 00:12:01,470
their authentication method of the

227
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:05,880
enterprise and network which is ie 802.1

228
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:10,740
X so every citizens we have it's his or

229
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:13,080
her own access point of access so this

230
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,640
is a brief summary in order to give you

231
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:18,180
some context about the different

232
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,949
networks that we have and now that we

233
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,060
know that type of networks that we have

234
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,490
we are going to see the different

235
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,300
weaknesses and threats that we may face

236
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:29,600
in H networks we have to talk about the

237
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,780
brute-force attacks that have been

238
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:37,550
specifically addressing to these wpa2

239
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:41,150
PSK networks so in this type of networks

240
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:45,020
usually there is a connection process

241
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:48,420
between the point of access and the user

242
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:51,210
normally you need to establish an a key

243
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:55,829
on encryption you know the two E's are

244
00:12:51,210 --> 00:13:01,740
private connection with the 4-way

245
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:05,089
handshake procedure that based on a

246
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:09,629
passphrase will

247
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:13,859
obtain another key which is the BTK

248
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:16,679
fairway strands in key and one of the

249
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:19,529
keys that it contains is the key of

250
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:22,350
encryption of the packages of the

251
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:25,559
clients so if someone knows the password

252
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:28,769
of the Wi-Fi he could generate an

253
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:33,679
encoding key that will be only valid

254
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,679
during the session if I connect later

255
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:46,049
we're sorry but the sound is not working

256
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:49,009
we are not receiving any sound from the

257
00:13:46,049 --> 00:13:49,009
auditorium

258
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:57,880
[Music]

259
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,960
[Music]

260
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,620
we've had a small issue but we've

261
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,140
already solved it sorry for the

262
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,110
inconvenience but we're getting back

263
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,330
well so after this failure which has not

264
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,810
been a cyberattack because we are in

265
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:35,290
cyber camp and we are very aware of that

266
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:38,900
well I was mentioning all the encoding

267
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:42,079
keys that a user needs to establish when

268
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:44,930
he or she connects connected himself or

269
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,870
herself to a Wi-Fi network but

270
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:57,640
everything starts with the passphrase

271
00:16:47,870 --> 00:17:00,710
that I've mentioned before can we decode

272
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:07,459
that information here we have a

273
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:10,100
screenshot that is capturing the

274
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,630
information that is arriving so I'm we

275
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:14,319
are not going to see this in detail but

276
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:17,060
these are communication packages that

277
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,139
are hiding the information that they

278
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:24,429
have inside because it is encoded this

279
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:28,430
has been done through our key the key

280
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,620
AES and this a es key can be obtained

281
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:33,260
through the passphrase is if I have the

282
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,449
passphrase I would be able to visualize

283
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,430
all the communication packages and not

284
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,840
just my communication packages but the

285
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,770
communication packages of all of the

286
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:47,720
users of that wireless network and for

287
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:50,660
example there is an free analysis

288
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:55,210
software called white shark shark that

289
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:58,070
through a screen shot of a cryptid

290
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:00,650
communication packages to obtain the

291
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:02,990
information we just need the passphrase

292
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:08,750
the Wi-Fi key

293
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:11,270
a s and this four-way handshake which is

294
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,330
the initial exchange so I've have all

295
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:19,090
these and data I can introduce the data

296
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:23,350
to the wire share application and next

297
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:28,659
we will be able to visualize all the

298
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:32,300
decoded packages that have been captured

299
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:34,730
so if we have the fact of having a Wi-Fi

300
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:40,899
network with the password doesn't mean

301
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:44,270
that it is secured we already knew that

302
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:49,130
information was communication was not

303
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:52,480
secured in open Wi-Fi networks and this

304
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:55,490
is why some malls and some hotels were

305
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,440
starting to add some passwords to that

306
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,240
connections but we have the same problem

307
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,790
if you know that passphrase the password

308
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,920
you're going to be able to intercept

309
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:08,510
these communication packages as we've

310
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:12,980
seen so how can we discover this

311
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:16,220
passphrase well there are experimental

312
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,760
ways to obtain this phrase for example

313
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,429
brute force because all of the

314
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,610
encryption systems are going to be based

315
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:29,390
on a key if I try if I can try all of

316
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:31,939
the keys I'm sure I'm going to end up

317
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:39,559
finding the one but the thing is that it

318
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:42,559
takes time however it's true that we can

319
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,620
kind of intervene in this procedure and

320
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,149
when we have devices that are connected

321
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,229
to our communication network these

322
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:53,600
devices are going to cause to create

323
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,120
these four-way handshakes shakes we can

324
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,340
capture these packages and then we can

325
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:04,610
try all the possible pass phrase

326
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:06,678
combinations and these combinations do

327
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,949
not really mean every combination we are

328
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:14,179
having a passphrase and we may think

329
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:16,670
that a user has has used words that are

330
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,590
easily easy to remember

331
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,440
characters that are in the laptop some

332
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,179
in the end we the number of combinations

333
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,050
is not that high and we can use these

334
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:31,790
brought brute-force methods we text

335
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:34,669
dictionaries books and I don't know

336
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:37,250
different files with password user of

337
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,930
users that have been discovered with all

338
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,760
these we can try all these combination

339
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:43,190
of keys and if we are lucky

340
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:47,950
in a recent reasonable amount of time we

341
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:53,120
may find the one this is at least how

342
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:55,700
things worked before we needed to at

343
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,260
least visualize the four-way Hadji but

344
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,080
what happens if there is no device

345
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:03,910
connected to the network these four Way

346
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,460
handshake are not going to happen but

347
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:11,200
lately we've seen that these four we

348
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:16,070
handshake contains this information

349
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:19,640
called PK MIT that also allows to obtain

350
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:22,939
the passphrase doing brute-force

351
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,870
mechanism so with access key keys or

352
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,130
access passwords passphrases and

353
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,449
following shake we are going to be able

354
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,520
to obtain all the information that we

355
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:37,730
need and what happens if someone finds

356
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:41,510
out what my passphrase is because what

357
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:44,360
the most frequent problem that I may

358
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:47,270
find as a normal user in my house is

359
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:51,310
that probably my neighbors who will will

360
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:54,500
get free Wi-Fi the thing here is that

361
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:58,280
people would also be able to intercept

362
00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:01,130
my communications and someone would be

363
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:03,920
able to know what I like which sites I

364
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:07,370
visit etc this is why we have to protect

365
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,230
carefully our passphrase and also

366
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,469
because we need to take into account how

367
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:15,680
my Wi-Fi networks network works at home

368
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:17,270
normally these are accessory that we use

369
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,970
in order to access the internet on a

370
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:22,400
flexible way so all the equipments that

371
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:25,250
there are in my Wi-Fi network going to

372
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,460
connect to the internet by just restream

373
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:31,399
there I be direction that my

374
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:34,009
internet router has so all the traffic

375
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:39,320
that is generated in a house and the

376
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:41,929
control the control information are

377
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:45,529
going to take place from the IP address

378
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:49,669
of the user so if someone commits a

379
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:53,749
crime using my IP address I'm going to

380
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:57,230
be the main suspect for that or at least

381
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:59,269
a person that has signed the Internet

382
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,990
agreement is going to be the suspected

383
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:06,049
person so the most simple solution would

384
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:08,779
be at least to use a complicated

385
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:11,029
password this at least would avoid that

386
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:13,519
we would have to go to the policy

387
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:17,299
station to give explanations about

388
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,519
something so how can I protect my last

389
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:23,408
phrase well I don't have to share this

390
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:29,690
passphrase with anyone or at least with

391
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:32,929
not a great number of people and

392
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,960
sometimes also providers all offer like

393
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:38,600
password for guests that may be valid

394
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,240
used for in some hours and that

395
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,639
afterwards will not work anymore the

396
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,659
passphrase should at least have at least

397
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:50,029
less at least 20 characters because

398
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:53,299
otherwise in some months anyone could

399
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:57,529
obtain the access passphrase of that

400
00:23:53,299 --> 00:24:01,779
Wi-Fi network and we also should change

401
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:01,779
our Wi-Fi pass phrase from time to time

402
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:13,279
so at least we should have faced with at

403
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,820
least 20 characters besides that we

404
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,889
should use another encryption method

405
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:22,460
such as for example the use of VPN

406
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:26,119
connections can we use also these

407
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,830
solutions for enterprise networks so

408
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:31,100
theoretically it would be possible

409
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,029
because the enterprise systems use the

410
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,699
same mechanism

411
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:38,480
therefore we handshake in order to

412
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:40,669
create the encryption key but it is true

413
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,690
that this encryption key is not

414
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:45,800
generated

415
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,630
through value which is easier to find

416
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,810
out how is this generated we will see

417
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:53,990
later that in enterprise systems when

418
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:58,010
the user needs to authenticate himself

419
00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:02,360
or herself random he is going to be sent

420
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:04,940
and through this random key another key

421
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,580
will be generated will be the encryption

422
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,710
key so the process here is more

423
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,389
complicated in the end the encryption

424
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:14,930
key is a value it can be generated

425
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:19,400
through brute force of course but with

426
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:21,230
the pmk system this is going to be

427
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,380
hardest harder because we are talking

428
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,480
about a binary system that is going to

429
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,700
take longer and that's why going to be

430
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:34,280
more complex so what are their

431
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:40,040
consequences if someone finds out the PM

432
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:44,260
k well their communications that are

433
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,879
going to be found found out our only

434
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:52,160
communications that are specific of a

435
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:54,260
moment of time and this is not going to

436
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:59,060
compromise the fact of other people

437
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:04,580
connecting to that network in personal

438
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:06,710
networks the process of connecting it's

439
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,240
very related to the password to the

440
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:11,380
passphrase but it's not the same thing

441
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,310
with enterprise systems however

442
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,640
brute-force attacks are very well known

443
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:20,120
and we are going to talk here about the

444
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,460
these do authentication attacks to wpa2

445
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,229
when I want to connect to a Wi-Fi

446
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:28,940
network there is a process of connection

447
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:30,980
and the connection and this implies the

448
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:35,150
exchange of different packages six

449
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:39,440
packages at least so first we look for

450
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:41,840
the point of access then once we know

451
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:48,260
what the point of access is I'm going to

452
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:51,470
send 12 requests then 12 responds and

453
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:54,010
then the communication is control after

454
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,270
that connection after that connection

455
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,190
these

456
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,389
where all the packages that I've

457
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,710
mentioned before are going to be

458
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:04,660
interchange exchange sorry if we are

459
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:10,410
having a wpa2 we are going to have the

460
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:15,220
forehand handshake and if we're having

461
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:18,100
an enterprise wpa2 we're going to have P

462
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:24,240
ap as in the authentication for we

463
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:27,730
handshake and then the encryption data

464
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,470
so when does this communication and

465
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,240
between the point of access and the

466
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,400
device when did they connect this

467
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,740
connection happens this disconnection is

468
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,630
going to take place by the mobile device

469
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,660
either I can connect to the Wi-Fi

470
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:45,130
network or I can disconnect when I

471
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:48,970
finished doing my thing however this

472
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:52,480
disconnection may also take place from

473
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:55,600
the point of accessed so sometimes the

474
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,750
points of access access can be saturated

475
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,209
or maybe a device is getting farther

476
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:04,540
from the point of access in this case

477
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:08,580
it's possible that a point of access

478
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:12,280
sends the disconnection or the

479
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:14,949
authentication packages the control of

480
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,860
that is very it's very simple so when I

481
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:20,860
have this authentication package that

482
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,830
goes from the point of access to the

483
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:26,379
mobile device the package is going to be

484
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,939
processed there is no control there so

485
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:32,559
that's the weakness that we may find

486
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:39,280
addresses of devices in wireless

487
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:43,389
networks have 48 bits and these values

488
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:47,410
are 48 bits are transmitted in the

489
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:51,010
wireless network without any in any

490
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:53,500
coding any encryption because if they

491
00:28:51,010 --> 00:29:00,580
would be encrypted if they were

492
00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:03,130
implicated they wouldn't be decoded can

493
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,500
we use this do tinta case

494
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,620
and packages without having any problem

495
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,930
we have the non-persistent the

496
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,510
authentication in these non-persistent

497
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,640
the authentication we send the

498
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,379
authentication packages to our device

499
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,820
which is connected to the access point

500
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:23,740
in order to trigger it to have the four

501
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:30,250
way handshake which is the one that

502
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:32,650
enables me to have the access key for

503
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:37,150
the Wi-Fi so an attacker here would have

504
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:40,750
to generate the authentication packages

505
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:44,820
which are correct enough we will see it

506
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:47,530
afterwards and it causes that the device

507
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,760
disconnects because it thinks that the

508
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:55,360
access point is telling it to disconnect

509
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:58,990
when it tries to reconnect it is when we

510
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:04,510
have the four way handshake that allows

511
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:09,040
me to derivate my access key if it is a

512
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:11,950
wrong a bad one if it has 20 characters

513
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,790
we wouldn't have any danger because at

514
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:18,850
the certain they our access key couldn't

515
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:22,389
be figured out there is another the

516
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:25,290
authentication mode which is the

517
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:28,660
persistent the authentication instead of

518
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,820
trying to activate the four way

519
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:36,940
handshake we are going to try to cause

520
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:40,060
harm we are going to be continuously

521
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:42,160
sending persistent the authentication

522
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:46,149
packages so that the device is trying to

523
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:49,360
connect all the time after a while the

524
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:51,940
device has reached the maximum of

525
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,550
attempts of connection and in the end

526
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:57,400
the communication is going to be broken

527
00:30:54,550 --> 00:31:01,840
so the user would have any Wi-Fi

528
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:08,620
connectivity so we have caused denial of

529
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:11,860
Wi-Fi connection what happens in wpa2

530
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:15,100
enterprise systems these resistant the

531
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,090
authentication could have an effect as

532
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,570
well

533
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:21,370
these kind of systems are better

534
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,460
protected because there are several

535
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:28,810
access points after certain point one

536
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:31,570
mobile device connects to this network

537
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:34,330
and an attacker sends persistent

538
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:38,409
identification packages in order to try

539
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:41,770
to prevent the connection so what does

540
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:44,560
the device do it tries to connect

541
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:48,879
through another access point and at this

542
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:53,470
point the attacker cannot do anything

543
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,840
else so they would need to change the

544
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,740
place J position you know the to send

545
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:01,600
other packages however they will need to

546
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:05,250
send other packages because the MAC

547
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:09,730
address of the access point is different

548
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:12,340
attacks wpa2 enterprise systems are

549
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:15,220
feasible but their effect is not as

550
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,470
important because due to the fact of

551
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,960
having different access points the

552
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:23,500
attacker needs to attack all the users

553
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,320
all the access points and so on let's

554
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:30,040
talk about how to take this into

555
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,200
practice which is creating our own the

556
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:35,500
authentication attacked in order to

557
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,250
create these kind of attacks we need

558
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:43,390
something as simple as generating

559
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:47,880
Wireless packages how can we generate

560
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:54,660
this kind of packages I follow the rules

561
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:59,470
or I use my network monitor in order to

562
00:32:54,660 --> 00:33:01,900
check manually which one of them are the

563
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:04,210
authentication packages the most

564
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,550
important thing here is the MAC address

565
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:09,220
of the access point and the mobile

566
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:13,240
device that we want to be disconnected

567
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:16,690
with those data that we can collect just

568
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:19,090
from observing the network we would have

569
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:23,100
the whole old information we need to

570
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:23,100
carry out this kind of attack

571
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:35,610
attacked us we need a hard word of

572
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:38,129
communications which is chipset a Wi-Fi

573
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:43,620
tips it with monitor mode which is a

574
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:47,220
functioning mode of chips enables our to

575
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:51,530
read any cheap and to transmit any

576
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:54,660
package in any format one inconvenience

577
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:57,690
these kind of attacks is the deal they

578
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:01,440
require physical presence I cannot do it

579
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:06,260
remotely from Japan for example so if I

580
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:14,060
don't want to be seen I need to be a bit

581
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:19,800
wait so in this case people use high

582
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:22,679
high level Wi-Fi antennas these hardware

583
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:27,869
needs to be managed by an operating

584
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:31,830
system and CPU and we would just need a

585
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:35,820
simple Raspberry Pi with an eyelift line

586
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:40,918
of system which will enable us to send

587
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:43,619
packages at speed fast enough to carry

588
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:46,469
out the attacked and finally we have the

589
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:50,600
programming of the delivery of these

590
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:53,790
kind of packages there are several tools

591
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,529
on the market you know that you carry

592
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:59,779
out these kind of attacks and to

593
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:05,010
detectives but I want to suggest you

594
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:07,560
creating your own packages with just 50

595
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,869
lines of code which enable you to

596
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,920
exploit these kind of problems and to

597
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:17,400
visualize them these will make you

598
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,940
understand any communication system

599
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,610
so do you create your own tools is also

600
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:30,710
important what have I done

601
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:35,100
will I I use C language and we also have

602
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:39,210
some libraries such as live cap which

603
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:41,640
enables us to read information from a

604
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:44,880
wireless communication system and to

605
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,770
transmit when I talk about wireless

606
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,730
communication system I'm talking about

607
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:53,910
any of them and how does this

608
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,640
demonstration work well I'm going to

609
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:59,120
[Music]

610
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:02,190
assemble Wi-Fi network with that

611
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:07,020
identifier with that pass phase which

612
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:11,610
would be very easy to it is very weak so

613
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:14,460
it is very easy to figure out this is

614
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:17,610
the access point that I'm going to use

615
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,150
it has a neutral e t--'s neutral so it

616
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:23,640
doesn't have access to internet any

617
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:28,500
device which is connected we will be

618
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:31,950
able to see data exchange here you also

619
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:35,760
have the tool that I showed you before a

620
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:39,419
raspberry P with Wi-Fi which will enable

621
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,900
me to see what devices are connected and

622
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:46,380
we can disconnect some devices in a

623
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,560
selected way that's what I'm going to do

624
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,560
now

625
00:36:50,390 --> 00:37:02,009
so that first I'm going to connect to

626
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:04,280
this raspberry P where I have all the

627
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:10,100
software in order to capture packages

628
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,100
and to be able to disconnect devices

629
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,380
first of all we need a program that

630
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:33,410
analyzes which devices are connected to

631
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:38,690
that wavy Network first I need to know

632
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:42,618
what Wi-Fi network is there so I'm going

633
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:45,440
to use Linux in order to know what Wi-Fi

634
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:49,069
networks are in my environment so I'm

635
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:52,520
going to include the data from the with

636
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:55,759
the network that I just created what

637
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,609
data do I have from this network I have

638
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,299
the MAC address of the access point

639
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:06,049
which is this data here the channel

640
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:08,960
which is the channel seven and the name

641
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:16,538
of the network so that we can program a

642
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:19,160
tool called Mac search that tool

643
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:22,819
introduces as parameters the interface

644
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:26,328
where we want to look for devices the

645
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:28,490
access point which will tell me what

646
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:30,710
devices are connected this is the

647
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:33,410
procedure that takes a while because it

648
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:53,510
waits for a device connected to that

649
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:57,799
network to transmit some packages yes I

650
00:38:53,510 --> 00:39:01,700
see you participate in actively so these

651
00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:04,099
are all the devices associated with my

652
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,848
access point I'm going to access this

653
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:06,849
access point

654
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,950
have another mochi

655
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:44,279
oaky estoppel luckiest Amazon here it is

656
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:48,000
the couldn't find it so here we have the

657
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:53,630
Wi-Fi network icon which will show that

658
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,630
we are connected and from my PC

659
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,280
okay

660
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:48,560
when I was in the throes of always goes

661
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,560
back

662
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:15,490
meanwhile I'm going to show you the tool

663
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:19,700
of the service delegation this tool

664
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:28,129
enables us to generate those the

665
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:32,149
authentication packages and what do we

666
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:34,010
need we need to enter the name of the

667
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:48,980
interface and rachanna where the

668
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:51,530
communication will be made so these are

669
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:55,880
the parameters the Wi-Fi interface

670
00:41:51,530 --> 00:42:00,500
interface the channel the 7th and the

671
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:09,050
access point so these two will allow me

672
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:15,590
to enter MAC addresses MAC address can

673
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:19,030
be deleted so I can withdraw the MAC

674
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:19,030
address that I am denying

675
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:44,990
what I meant was taking a wife or my PC

676
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:47,020
to get connected let's see how many we

677
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,020
have

678
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:49,940
I have a couple of here if any one else

679
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:53,119
gets connected then it will enable us to

680
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:55,700
see the Wi-Fi icon as if I were

681
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,720
connected and when I sent the do tenth

682
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:02,379
occasion packages that Wi-Fi icon will

683
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,379
be disconnected

684
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:46,009
Vishakha understand this demos and what

685
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:50,250
happens when we are denying that device

686
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:56,160
if the device is connected the icon of

687
00:44:50,250 --> 00:45:00,810
Wi-Fi will disconnect itself so these

688
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:10,140
will disconnect all the devices in the

689
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:13,590
network okay I'm gonna do another

690
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:16,140
demonstration and if we have more time

691
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:21,510
in the end I will show I will continue

692
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:24,900
on these the urgent occasion package how

693
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:29,370
can a denial of service attack be used

694
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:33,120
they will disable a network add device

695
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:35,160
level so we can select devices or we can

696
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:39,259
block all the devices within that

697
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:46,379
network it has one main limitation

698
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:49,560
physical presence many occasions the

699
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:52,970
attacker doesn't want to be exposed most

700
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:56,690
of denial of service attacks aim at

701
00:45:52,970 --> 00:46:00,660
reputational harm in other words to make

702
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:03,270
- to block a network so that that

703
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:07,470
enterprise that company cannot offer

704
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:12,600
services to their clients they could

705
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:15,359
manage to have device only device that

706
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:21,860
can have access to all of them another

707
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:26,310
attacked is made to smart houses because

708
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:29,760
we are increasingly adding more internet

709
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:34,200
of things at home so if it is attacked

710
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:38,550
we could have harm on our house and

711
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:42,169
where could we effect a harm economic

712
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:45,760
harm world to those companies which

713
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:49,130
whose business model is based on a

714
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:54,580
wireless communication for example in

715
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:58,460
some restaurants waiters waiters use

716
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:01,310
tablet with Wi-Fi connection in order to

717
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:04,460
connect with the system of the

718
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:05,900
restaurant and in this case the harm

719
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,040
will be high

720
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:14,330
obviously the attacker has to build an

721
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:18,380
infrastructure in order to stop the

722
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:22,640
network imagine this happens a Saturday

723
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:25,730
night in a restaurant were a kitchen

724
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,520
where the kitchen needs to work at a

725
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:31,400
very fast speed and if the network

726
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,220
doesn't work the staff won't probably

727
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,950
know what to do so then they will need

728
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:39,290
to go back to you take orders in paper

729
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:43,790
in order to solve the problem if in that

730
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:47,540
crisis situation somebody offers their

731
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:51,320
help we would accept it and then it's

732
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:54,680
what we call the miraculous call the

733
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:55,940
internet operator calls us and tells us

734
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,819
that there is a preliminary

735
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,140
communication system

736
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:04,850
unfortunately the functioning of the

737
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:07,940
company makes them to take a while to

738
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:10,400
solve it but they are offering an extra

739
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:13,670
service where a technician can come to

740
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:17,420
the restaurant probably in that crisis

741
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:25,850
moment they will accept it and the

742
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:30,200
operator will come the attacker will

743
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:31,759
come will make everything will solve all

744
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,850
the problems and that's where the

745
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,400
attacker gets some economic some

746
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:40,390
economic benefit obviously their

747
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:43,640
exposure here is higher because they are

748
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:44,819
the expose themselves they they go

749
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:51,240
physically

750
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:55,110
today you piay two systems are quite

751
00:48:51,240 --> 00:49:04,450
unprotected because there is no rule to

752
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:09,850
incorporate protection mechanism until

753
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:14,410
the moment when we have WPA three

754
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:17,049
systems with protection we will have

755
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:21,940
similar abilities and then what we need

756
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:25,570
to do is do to create a tool in order to

757
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:27,310
detect a the authentication packages and

758
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:29,250
if there are many of them that means the

759
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:32,740
network is not curved isn't it

760
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:35,740
functioning correctly ok my PC is

761
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:49,089
already connected so let's continue with

762
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:58,229
this and I can send pings to the access

763
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:58,230
point so it is going to reply oops sorry

764
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:08,820
parameters of the wireless network may

765
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:12,580
have changed we are in channel one now

766
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:15,490
so we do the same we look for MAC

767
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:18,279
addresses in channel one and we see some

768
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:21,839
of them already on the screen the one

769
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,840
from my PC

770
00:50:40,230 --> 00:51:09,490
let's see if I can find mine okay I

771
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:11,800
automatically disconnected I'm going to

772
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:14,520
show you the last presentation because I

773
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:23,790
do not have a lot of time ahead of me

774
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:30,240
this is one of the most known flash

775
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:36,520
hiding of Wi-Fi networks if we avoid

776
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:39,970
connection then these kind of attacks

777
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:43,690
should not affect us is it possible to

778
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:46,750
transmit wireless packages without being

779
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:49,270
connected to a wireless network yes

780
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:53,650
under some conditions the information

781
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:57,700
has to be limited in the Internet of

782
00:51:53,650 --> 00:52:00,640
Things you need to exchange some small

783
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:03,700
amount of data coming from the sensors

784
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:06,190
and what does it involve we need to

785
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:09,879
transmit packages that can be processed

786
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:12,730
by any device those packages are the

787
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:16,360
control patches packages from the Wi-Fi

788
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:19,900
network with one special feature there

789
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:22,570
are some special packages called beacon

790
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:24,670
frames which will enable us to transmit

791
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:29,980
big amount of data

792
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:33,190
those beacon frames inform about the

793
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,730
features of the access point the name of

794
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:41,630
the network the

795
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:44,540
is ID the espied channel and so on so

796
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,790
these packages are sent from the AP to

797
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:49,250
all the machines within the network they

798
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:51,770
can be processed by any chip and they

799
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:56,830
are incorporated in a structure with a

800
00:52:51,770 --> 00:53:00,650
code to indicate to indicate the code

801
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:10,250
the length nine bytes and the name of

802
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:12,700
the SSID and what does this mean in

803
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:17,240
beacon frame packages we can add

804
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:23,779
additional tags I can use tag which is

805
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:25,959
not being used such as 255 and I can

806
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:30,940
introduce the amount of data that I want

807
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:35,510
this will lead to hide our data

808
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:40,340
communication and how does it work ok we

809
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:42,770
have an access point that from from time

810
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:44,570
to time changes the beacon frame in the

811
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:48,500
middle of that communication we can

812
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:51,020
enter very similar packages with

813
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:54,950
different amount of data the data that

814
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:59,480
we want to transmit and what can we do

815
00:53:54,950 --> 00:54:02,330
with this at some point two devices can

816
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:06,530
exchange these packages and exchange

817
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:11,150
data but data at a very limited level

818
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:16,490
for example we can have a chat system

819
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:19,880
where two devices exchange test messages

820
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:22,819
which are incorporated into beacon

821
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:25,910
frames which are very similar to a Wi-Fi

822
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:28,250
in the environment so with this we are

823
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:31,250
going to be able to hide them at a

824
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:35,150
certain level those packages can be seen

825
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:39,550
so we need to encrypt those data with in

826
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:44,480
this case has used the AES encryption

827
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:47,180
and as a result we have packages between

828
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,060
two devices using

829
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:53,990
access point and they are going to use

830
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:56,779
the format of the AP beacon frames in

831
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:58,459
order to exchange hours what are we

832
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,800
going to detect in that communication

833
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,730
we're going to detect a lot of beacon

834
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,310
frame packages

835
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:06,890
some of them will incorporate our data

836
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:09,320
how to discriminate how to distinguish

837
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:14,210
them well it is a very tedious process

838
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:18,980
all the all the access point packages

839
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:21,410
have a frequency number ours are not

840
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:24,710
going to have the same sequence number

841
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:28,100
another thing to distinguish them is the

842
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:31,130
size if they carry more data they are

843
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:34,730
going to have a bigger size so we could

844
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:38,240
detect them by size but at first that

845
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:42,710
communication could be performed okay

846
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:46,069
this is my last demonstration I hope not

847
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:49,640
to have any problems in this

848
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:53,690
demonstration we I am going to use the

849
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:57,290
Raspberry Pi with an app called hidden

850
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:59,900
chat this application transmits beacon

851
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:03,170
frame packages with messages I am going

852
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:09,770
to introduce and in my PC I mean going

853
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:13,940
to use the same application in order to

854
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:27,590
send those day data so the parameters

855
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:31,580
that the supplication needs are the data

856
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:34,490
from the Wi-Fi network which is going to

857
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:38,890
be used as a transportation vehicle

858
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:45,799
let's say the user is least with

859
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:54,580
interface wlan0 with channel one from

860
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:54,580
the AP and the address the MAC address

861
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:15,808
Gandhi is ID which would be Wi-Fi jbg

862
00:57:04,279 --> 00:57:19,469
Wi-Fi okay so here who would be ready to

863
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:21,749
send a message as a beacon frame package

864
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:26,849
which is similar to the access point

865
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:29,759
package here we would do the same but

866
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:42,059
let's change the user name let's say

867
00:57:29,759 --> 00:57:44,219
Elena from the moment we start sending a

868
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:47,539
message on the other window we can see

869
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:47,539
the message hello

870
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:10,700
doesn't know where they don't just a

871
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:15,339
second because I want you to see the

872
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:15,339
packages that I have just exchange it

873
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:37,540
let these and let's send a couple of

874
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:37,540
messages

875
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:58,500
I don't know if I will be able to

876
00:58:54,610 --> 00:59:01,510
capture anything because Eid was halted

877
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:04,710
let's see they become frame packages I'm

878
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,710
going to order them

879
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:03,038
yes I just wanted to show you what these

880
00:59:59,289 --> 01:00:06,519
packages look like if we order them by

881
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:09,670
size which is the easiest way to find

882
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:16,509
them we see there are two packages here

883
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:19,119
I didn't have enough time to capture

884
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:22,690
them okay I'm running out of time I'm

885
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:28,450
very sorry in the slide if you have the

886
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:36,519
screenshot of the packages that we can

887
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:39,339
visualize those packages have a very

888
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:45,189
similar size but a different sequence

889
01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:47,049
numbers so inside we will have the

890
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:49,299
encrypted messages that we want to be

891
01:00:47,049 --> 01:00:50,799
able to visualize and that's all for me

892
01:00:49,299 --> 01:00:53,579
thank you very much for your attention

893
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:53,579
on your time

894
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:01,910
[Applause]

895
01:00:59,849 --> 01:01:01,910
you
