what are we going to talk about in this

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,770
presentation well we are going to

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,490
explain what a hacker needs to put

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,929
inside his backpack we're not just going

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,000
to talk about physical things we are

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,180
going to talk about more interesting

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,070
things behind physical besides physical

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:44,909
things and what we want to tell you is

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,158
how little by little you can feel your

30
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,670
backpack with experience with training

31
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,920
in order to become real hackers so

32
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,049
because we what we want to explain to

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,490
you is our personal experience and

34
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:04,890
things that we've found important in in

35
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:07,679
a hackers career finally we want to to

36
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,989
remind you that you have to put whatever

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,129
you want to in do in your back pocket

38
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,470
you can take it to a con what we've

39
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:16,459
explained to you but in the end it's up

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,230
you're free to decide so before deciding

41
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,330
what to put in sites a hacker mark pack

42
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,630
we should try to explain what a hacker

43
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:30,360
is do you know what a hacker is what's a

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:32,640
hacker okay we have more people coming

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,280
in the room well if we have to define

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,190
what a hacker is we would say that or

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,840
well at least Alex and I agree on this

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,740
definition and I hope you agree on this

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,190
definition too we would say that a

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:51,390
hacker is an expert on cybersecurity

51
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:54,180
that tries to do the best and that tries

52
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,458
to go beyond the normal thinking by

53
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:02,850
applying natural thinking he is willing

54
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:05,390
to learn and wants to all to himself or

55
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,890
herself you know that to solve problems

56
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:09,179
there is nothing here that it could make

57
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,458
you think that a hacker is a cyber

58
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,350
criminal right no nothing at all

59
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,470
but it's something that people usually

60
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,090
think about when they listen the world

61
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,330
hacker but it doesn't have a negative

62
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,850
connotation it's positive but even

63
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:28,800
though all of us probably already know

64
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:31,079
it a hacker is not related to cyber

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,480
criminal hacker is unexperienced our

66
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,120
security who is willing to learn and

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,220
wants to solve problems for the common

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,920
good so this is why it's important for

69
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,260
hacker to have a good backpack right yes

70
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,798
exactly and why are we talking about our

71
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,840
backpack well we have to mark back marks

72
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,100
here instead of one one is empty and one

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,350
is filled with things but we're talking

74
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,140
about a backpack because in a backpack a

75
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,769
hacker can put anything he needs because

76
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,890
I hacker

77
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:05,040
it's a cyber security expert that needs

78
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,619
to apply letter thinking and he needs to

79
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,429
have something to transport everything

80
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,200
he is going to need well so for example

81
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,200
in a backpack we should have a computer

82
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,798
with stickers of course any important

83
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,079
hacker needs to have our computer and

84
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,090
the computer needs to have a lot of

85
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,849
stickers something like that the

86
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,070
stickers depend on the taste of the user

87
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:33,620
but you need to have a lot of stickers

88
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:37,199
so that people can know what your hacker

89
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:39,930
you also need a switch here

90
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,290
I should suit with a hood probably but

91
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,919
we are not wearing sweatshirt

92
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:50,610
Alex yeah I prefer wearing Blazers and I

93
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,740
prefer wearing shared yeah but it's true

94
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,780
that in films usually hackers are

95
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,070
wearing these sweatshirts well but I'm a

96
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:01,049
hacker and I'm not wearing that type of

97
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,409
clothing well it's not needed so hackers

98
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,160
do not always have to wear sweater shirt

99
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,169
what else will

100
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,540
several gadgets well I brought a lot of

101
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,799
gadgets because because I love

102
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:14,370
communication and they always have

103
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,710
gadgets in my backpack I here have a

104
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,990
radio here aha here have a modem I

105
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,940
usually take a lot of things with me in

106
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,389
my backpack

107
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,860
so if you see that alex is coming closer

108
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,330
to you with a backpack you will see that

109
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,260
he is connecting and disconnecting

110
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:33,630
devices ok so we need our computer

111
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,240
shirt or all other type of clothing and

112
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:41,849
several gadgets ok if you have that

113
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,280
stuff you're already happy right so am I

114
00:05:41,849 --> 00:05:47,610
already a hacker if I have that insight

115
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,380
yes you and everyone here in the room ok

116
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,849
so we finished with our presentation

117
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,849
no we haven't finished with our

118
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:56,969
presentation but again why are we

119
00:05:53,849 --> 00:06:00,409
wearing a backpack well because in the

120
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:05,639
end we need to start somewhere when we

121
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:07,979
want to become cyber security experts we

122
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,349
have to when we start thinking that we

123
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,690
really like that feel sometimes we don't

124
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:16,080
know what to do we have a backpack that

125
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,800
we can fill with things but we need to

126
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,719
have clear ideas in our mind before

127
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,960
starting thinking that we want to work

128
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,340
on these we need to start thinking first

129
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,739
of all about motivation it is very

130
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,169
important to be motivate motivated we

131
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,450
have to ask ourselves very simple

132
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,820
questions that are going to be basic for

133
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,810
us for our career for example why do you

134
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,960
want to study cyber security is it

135
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:43,150
is fashionable because I'm watching a

136
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,789
lot a lot of cybersecurity series on TV

137
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,909
because there are a lot of news on TV or

138
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,169
because I'm passionate about it well I

139
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,360
think that's basic if you're not

140
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:53,830
passionate about this it doesn't make

141
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,100
sense you have to be sure that you want

142
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,950
to study these even though in the TV

143
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:03,880
series their cybersecurity seems very

144
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,719
fun this profession requires a lot of

145
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,400
your time

146
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,320
and a lot of hours experimenting and

147
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,539
testing and trying things so even though

148
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,450
it seems silly we have to ask ourselves

149
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,090
these questions we don't have to be

150
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,760
thinking about what's fast what's

151
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,919
fashionable what's not when I started

152
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,810
working in this field I realized that I

153
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,450
was passionate about this and I'm lucky

154
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,210
enough to be working as a hacker because

155
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,070
that's my my passion and time flies for

156
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,049
me when I'm working and that's the most

157
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,990
wonderful thing that can happen to you

158
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,419
and I completely agree with that even

159
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,140
though I've been trained as a journalist

160
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,849
I've started working in the field of

161
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,400
cybersecurity and I've realized that I

162
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:53,650
really like it and it's true that people

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,000
from different backgrounds are working

164
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,250
in cybersecurity but it's important that

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,800
you lights have a security maybe you

166
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,900
start doing you start studying

167
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,560
cybersecurity and you realize that you

168
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,870
don't like it but it's okay also

169
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,350
something else that you need is attitude

170
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,690
you need to be willing to learn all the

171
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,250
time if you don't if you are not willing

172
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,380
to do that you're not going to go

173
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,900
anywhere because if we you want to

174
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,150
become a cybersecurity professional you

175
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,940
are going to get it if you have that

176
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,280
attitude if you spend hours learning if

177
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,990
you're able to adapt to any situation

178
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,690
this is not easy we are not always going

179
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:34,680
to find the solution to all of the

180
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,838
problems that are happening we need to

181
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,459
learn to look for alternatives to look

182
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,599
for different solutions to problems and

183
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:45,430
this means having the right attitude and

184
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,750
probably you have also people around you

185
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:51,479
that are already working on

186
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:53,819
cybersecurity that you may know

187
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,220
personally or make for example you

188
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:59,550
already know us you have our Twitter

189
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,980
accounts asked people around you ask

190
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:05,370
people that you know about that about

191
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:09,709
the work what they started doing I mean

192
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:16,800
here is already something that speaks

193
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:23,969
speaks up for you and also of course you

194
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:25,620
we are here a lot of experts dot but no

195
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,759
others have a security but do not just

196
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,199
think about people here in this

197
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,720
auditorium in the other auditorium

198
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:33,420
people that are sitting around you may

199
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:39,180
have a lot of knowledge that may also

200
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:41,279
help you so don't be afraid contact and

201
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:46,229
talk to the people that's here with you

202
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:48,779
talked to people that surround you not

203
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,449
just the speakers here are a tool that

204
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,959
you can use anyone that's here in this

205
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:58,109
room may be on stage the fact that he we

206
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,359
are here it doesn't mean that 20 in 20

207
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,519
minutes we are going to be here sitting

208
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,040
with you in fact we are going to people

209
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,769
enjoying this event with the rest of the

210
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,569
people here afterwards and regarding

211
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,149
cybersecurity there are many tenderized

212
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:13,889
that you can follow it's like TV there

213
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:15,300
are so many channels to choose that you

214
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,149
need to know what you really like and

215
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,740
what you're good at because in the end

216
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,620
you start experimenting with a lot of

217
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,949
things you start trying and you think

218
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,819
okay I want to do pen testing risk

219
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:28,800
management you don't really know there

220
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:31,740
are many things to do you can start

221
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,209
trying different things and maybe you

222
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:39,059
realize that you're good at mobile phone

223
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:41,819
cybersecurity try different things

224
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:43,410
try try as many things as you can and at

225
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:45,209
one point you will you would realize

226
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,899
that you're good at something and you

227
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:50,609
will be willing to learn more about a

228
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:53,399
specific field and this is the moment in

229
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:57,509
which you would have fine you would have

230
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,829
found your application so it's normal

231
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:01,120
that in the beginning you don't know

232
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:04,660
exactly what it what to do

233
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,480
or it's okay there is not a problem you

234
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,670
have to try different things but of

235
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,829
course do not start with the most

236
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,229
complex things start with simple things

237
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:16,649
start by reading because you have to

238
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:21,040
read aloud you have to learn a lot and

239
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:23,649
in the end the key of success does not

240
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,870
only lie on technical training I mean

241
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,910
technical training and in technical

242
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:33,160
knowledge is basically bad attitude is

243
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:38,050
basic - there will be willing to learn

244
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:41,819
and doing doing new things it is what is

245
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:46,628
going to make you grow in your field and

246
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:48,610
for example I started in my room my room

247
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:51,279
looked like a laboratory

248
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,309
my parents were sick sick of me because

249
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,139
I had a lot of computers in my room

250
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:59,439
you're saying it looked like in the past

251
00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:02,920
as now it was normal room okay now it's

252
00:11:59,439 --> 00:12:05,469
quite similar actually but this was my

253
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,029
motivation to learn and to do different

254
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,459
things and this is what you have to do

255
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:13,089
you have and now you have a lot of

256
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:16,540
resources there are manuals Erica aligns

257
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:18,509
their confidence such as this one and

258
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,309
well people that are studying right now

259
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:24,160
also count on something which is basic

260
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:27,490
you have a lot of time right now you are

261
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,800
in the in the period of life in which

262
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:33,040
you have a lot of time for you because

263
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,709
as time goes goes by time is going to

264
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,099
limit so even if you think that you have

265
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:41,079
a lot of exams and things to do you have

266
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,309
plenty of time it's true that when

267
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:43,719
you're a student you don't think that

268
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:49,179
you have a lot of free time

269
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:52,559
but enjoy but you are free enough to do

270
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:55,709
a lot of things with your time and

271
00:12:52,559 --> 00:13:00,389
because you will realize later that

272
00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:04,119
things and life gets more complex I

273
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:06,279
always like to say that when I stop

274
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,490
liking what I am doing

275
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,559
I will do something else because now

276
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,319
this is my passion this is what I do do

277
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,889
it and besides being my profession this

278
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:17,920
is again

279
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:19,449
for me I'm having fun doing my job

280
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,569
and that's the best thing that can

281
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:25,628
happen to anyone so let's start filling

282
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:27,849
our backpack what should we have in our

283
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:29,290
backpack of course a computer without a

284
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,389
computer we are not going to be able to

285
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,269
do anything you can choose the computer

286
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:38,279
that you want to of course getting to

287
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:39,839
know operating systems is important

288
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,730
God's ears

289
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,249
also are needed because I for example

290
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,019
like right radio frequency and the field

291
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:48,939
of radio frequency so I had a lot of

292
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,379
gadgets related to that by depending on

293
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:53,799
what you do you would you would have

294
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:56,079
different gadgets but you have to start

295
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:58,569
filling your backpack with things that

296
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,699
are going to help you with which you

297
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:04,089
will be played and you you're going to

298
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:06,429
be playing my my crack is quite heavy

299
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:09,549
but you're not going to fill the

300
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:11,049
backpack in just in one day and you

301
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:13,179
don't have to spend a lot of money on

302
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:17,379
the first day on many gadgets that you

303
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:21,040
don't know how to use you're going to be

304
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:22,629
buying gadgets little by little when you

305
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,079
find out what you like what you don't

306
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:29,230
like well so it's not that you have to

307
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,769
buy a lot of things in your backpack

308
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,329
without meaning it's not that you're

309
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,689
going to arrive to a store and you're

310
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,549
going to say please can you feel my

311
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:41,860
backpack and we said that you need a lot

312
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:43,509
of books you need to read aloud you need

313
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,040
to be on different volume you need to

314
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:47,860
participate this is a technology world

315
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,339
which progress is very fast they're

316
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,689
emerging technologies that are changing

317
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,239
techniques tactics procedures of

318
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:56,919
cybercriminals change and increase and

319
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:59,350
you need to be up-to-date and you need

320
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:02,139
to know what's happening around you and

321
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:06,220
you're only going to be able to do that

322
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:08,860
by reading I have an iPad and next to my

323
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:12,819
bed and before going to bed I spent one

324
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:15,160
hour reading because technology moves so

325
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:19,238
fast that if I don't do that

326
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,949
the I will be lost I would be lost and

327
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:24,100
if you think that you're are allergic to

328
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:28,238
books it really means also reading

329
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,590
Twitter reading forum contacting people

330
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:30,180
there

331
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,860
Publishing the interesting thing reading

332
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,410
means reading anything of course you

333
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,960
need to read books too even if you don't

334
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,930
like them you need to read books videos

335
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,070
etc but also you can read another type

336
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,599
of format such as specialized forum

337
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,330
different channels in which experts

338
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:55,500
participate this is also a way of

339
00:15:48,330 --> 00:16:00,300
learning these are very exciting and

340
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:04,290
once we have these clear we will start

341
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,990
finding out our own there are different

342
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,060
possible fields you can become a

343
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:13,830
security engineer or security

344
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:15,810
architecture you can be computing or

345
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:21,480
cyber security consultant and help

346
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:27,479
companies you can be pen tester I mean

347
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:30,660
you can both try to devote to some of

348
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,240
these fields some teams are going to

349
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,219
spend time trying to attract vulnerable

350
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,070
systems in order to find vulnerabilities

351
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,010
some other will try some other teams

352
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:44,930
will try to defend to look for best ways

353
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:47,970
of defending equipments if you are

354
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,739
defending in the defenders team you need

355
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:53,250
to know also how the bad guys are going

356
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,100
to attack a view never tried techniques

357
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,890
that are used in pen testing you are not

358
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,600
going to know that so that's another

359
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:09,420
knowledge that is going to bring you

360
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:10,980
value also sometimes you can gather with

361
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,470
a group of people in order to do this

362
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:19,110
job and try things for example you can

363
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,940
meet with your friends and sometimes we

364
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:24,179
the attacker sometimes we be the

365
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,550
defender or the other way around you

366

have many possibilities here and you

367
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,780
have a lot of options there are many

368
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,690
virtual machines virtual equipments that

369
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:39,660
with which you can play with which you

370
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:41,910
can try what your knowledge you can try

371
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,160
to configure it your own first

372
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,220
equipments and try to attack them and

373
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,600
defend them this is not just something

374
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,480
that you can do in your professional

375
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,310
time you can also incorporate this in to

376
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,740
your free time because nowadays

377
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:58,740
technology allow allows us to create

378
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:04,110
micro spaces in which we can play and

379
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:07,200
learn so do nothing that you are just

380
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,810
going to be able to start working side

381
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,090
offender or attacker and when you start

382
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,610
working in a company you can try things

383
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,379
right now you also have to learn

384
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,629
programming languages this is very

385
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,830
important you can any language that that

386
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,080
you like Python golang etc this is going

to help you a lot solving the problems

388
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,449
operating systems that's very important

389
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:35,160
too you have to learn about lining every

390
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:37,370
operating system that you can find try

391
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:42,720
this operating system try to install it

392
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:46,110
then try to play with the setups all

393

networks communications social media

397
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,939
cyber security involves many different

398
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,550
disciplines you need to know a little

399
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,810
bit of everything everything and if you

400
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:09,360
know about communication about switching

401
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:11,070
switches management this is also going

402
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,800
to help you when you start working as a

403
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,939
cyber security professional and you have

404
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,830
to solve as have a security problem

405
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,380
because getting to know everything

406
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:25,830
that's inside our company is going to

407
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,090
help you understand what's happening and

408
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,460
I'm not just talking about technical

409
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:32,820
stuff there is something that we usually

410
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,910
forget about we also need to understand

411
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,330
what the legal framework is you know

412
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:41,670
that you solve a security incident you

413
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,800
it's not that you just have to be a

414
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,020
technical expert you need to know the

415
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,240
legislation you know you need to know

416
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:50,879
how to speak how to communicate this is

417
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,760
basic for you to learn to use both

418
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,720
technical language but also

419
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,500
communication language because when you

420
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,870
have to explain

421
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,090
something to your mind a year or when

422
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,189
you have to explain something before our

423
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,629
committee committee you will have to use

424
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,240
a very different language and you need

425
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:09,720
to practice that too so if you have the

426
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,520
opportunity to speak in public make the

427
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,260
most of these of it because this is

428
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,410
going to also to help you become better

429
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,879
professional and well as our ask your

430
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:21,120
Nana was saying I have a lot of things

431
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:24,750
in my room he was saying that his

432
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,300
parents were sick of his room because he

433
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,640
had a lot of gadgets there that's true

434
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,460
when I was living with my parents I had

435
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,200
a lot of that's it this is their the

436
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:39,270
latest version I have right now in my

437
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:41,550
room and well all these gadgets are from

438
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:47,460
a very well-known manufacturer that you

439
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:49,320
may know and with all these materials I

440
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:56,070
started creating my own laboratory I

441
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:58,320
have different Wi-Fi different VLAN some

442
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:01,020
things that not even companies have and

443
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:07,350
these all these things allow me to very

444
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:10,620
men to try things up because well he's

445
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:13,620
our professional as we know that is

446
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,649
working as a cyber security expert and

447
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:20,459
when he wants to be better to improve

448
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:22,770
himself he does this thing he tries in

449
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,970
his own laboratory he meets with some

450
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:28,500
friends in order to test things yes of

451
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,200
course I have my own laboratory have

452
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,270
limited Wi-Fi sigh have firewalls with

453
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,680
different network interfaces I have

454
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:40,260
different VPNs I have different things

455
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,720
that allow me to try different things I

456
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,620
do Telegram integrations etc and

457
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,750
everything that is playing to you before

458
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,070
language a programming language

459
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,870
languages networking etc all these

460
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,149
knowledge ease I'm applying them at home

461
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,219
and you don't need to have a high budget

462
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,430
in order to create your own laboratory

463
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,230
you can work in many different ways you

464
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,200
only need to have the right attitude and

465
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,450
be willing to learning

466
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,070
also you can create your own internet as

467
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,980
Eleanor saying I practice with my

468
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:13,370
friends I have VPN created with my

469
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:16,130
friends and we have our own DNS servers

470
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,989
vulnerable machines that we can try to

471
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:21,409
attack we have firewalls we have

472
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:25,639
different services in which we can break

473
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:29,510
into because my friends also love these

474
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:32,178
same thing as me and this allow us this

475
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,950
allows us to to learn for example I've

476
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:38,750
seen that this happens let's see how

477
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:43,039
this would behave in our own micro space

478
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,720
micro cyber space it seems a little bit

479
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,850
weird to say you can create your own

480
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,639
internet but this is something that you

481
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:51,980
can really do because if you is create

482
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:55,610
up in this fake internet it's fine it

483
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:58,820
doesn't matter because you we can all

484
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:04,399
learn from our mistakes if things do not

485
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:05,059
work for us once or twice you can keep

486
00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:08,570
on trying

487
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:11,330
I prefer of course messing it up in my

488
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,149
own internet that messing it up at my

489
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,460
own work because and also you may find

490
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:19,219
interesting things for example the fact

491
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,529
of having my own network I've learned

492
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,070
and showed me how my TV was

493
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:27,350
communicating with other services I

494
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:31,879
could take an SML file and send it

495
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:34,399
somewhere I mean you can research and

496
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,159
and start writing your own blog or a

497
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:38,360
forum or you can go to a conference and

498
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,330
tell about your own experience about

499
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,070
what you found in your own internet or

500
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:49,250
in your own house so make the most of it

501
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:51,649
and in the end something and then this

502
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,990
is the last thing I want to mention

503
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:55,789
again we would like to hide like that

504
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:59,990
you have to read a lot feed your own

505
00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:03,470
social media feeds before the pages the

506
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:07,010
websites that you like the most used

507
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:09,860
Twitter participating for him work on

508
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,929
your personal image my and work on

509
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,059
yourself by working with other experts

510
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,470
with friends go to different conferences

511
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:22,020
this all these things are very in

512
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:24,750
very enriching and well as we were

513
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:28,020
saying it is very important to attend

514
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,330
different events you're going to be able

515
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:34,350
to meet a lot of people not just

516
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:37,500
speakers as I said before you're not

517
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,899
just going to see face to face people

518
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,770
that you may have known on social media

519
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:47,370
also you can know other experts that are

520
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:50,100
attending the event with you don't be

521
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:53,158
afraid of that if you see someone you

522
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,799
want to approach do it talk to that

523
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:59,850
people ask questions because these

524
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:02,900
people is going to help you know more

525
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:05,280
things and they're going to help you

526
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,559
decide what you want to do so you have

527
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,440
to go to different events you have to

528
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,539
share your knowledge too because even

529
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,289
though if you don't know a lot about

530
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:22,169
something this knowledge may be very

531
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:26,490
useful for for someone else so you have

532
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:28,140
to there to to speak in public you know

533
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,970
that to share also your knowledge in

534
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,030
very different form in which you can do

535
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:35,220
that so get involved in all these things

536
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:39,059
and also you can even organize these

537
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:43,490
type of events or you can help

538
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:46,200
organizers of an event know that you

539
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:50,669
create events such as this one for

540
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,289
example you can come up with an event of

541
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:55,679
cybersecurity in your own high school

542
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:57,210
which is also interesting too it's true

543
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,309
that organizing an event may be

544
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:04,049
complicated and it is time-consuming but

545
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:07,379
it is very important to spread knowledge

546
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:10,889
and to create this type of event and I'm

547
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,809
saying so because I'm an organizer of an

548
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,299
event of this type here in Valencia

549
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:17,700
so whenever if you don't find events

550
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:19,799
that may be interesting free for you try

551
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,080
to organize them yourself it is going to

552
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:25,649
allow you to get to know people from the

553
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,120
field from the sector sometimes you will

554
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:29,100
be attending a conference sometimes you

555
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,040
will be organizing a conference and in

556
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,810
the end you are going

557
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,950
get to know many experts and many

558
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:38,139
professionals that will give you many

559
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:40,510
ideas and this all these things are

560
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,030
going to enrich your backpack also

561
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:46,810
repositories are important this is a way

562
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:49,750
of sharing - you can use different

563
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:52,179
repositories to share knowledge

564
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:56,590
knowledge or experiments in which you're

565
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:58,800
working this this is going to help you

566
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:02,800
show that you have the right attitude

567
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,020
that you are motivated and that this is

568
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,110
going to make you out stand from the

569
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,730
rest of the people because there may be

570
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:13,719
people doing very interesting things

571
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:15,700
that don't make these things visible but

572
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,440
it's important to make things physical

573
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,140
visible and this is going to help you

574
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,060
out stand for example in a in an

575
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,210
intervener in a job interview you are

576
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,860
going to be able to show your motivation

577
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:30,970
on a field in which you are interested

578
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:34,389
that's true I've interviewed people to

579
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:37,570
join my team and I asked these people if

580
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:39,010
they have paper stories in within things

581
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,710
in which they are participating all

582
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,660
these things are important if you showed

583
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,000
me that you have the right attitude and

584
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:50,530
that you are motivated about about

585
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,590
cybersecurity and that you want to to

586
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:56,260
stand out and to yourself this is very

587
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,199
important for example having blogs is

588
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:02,650
very important to having participating

589
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,810
in repositories I mean you may be the

590
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:08,970
interviewer may ask you that questions

591
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:14,379
even if he has or she has look for that

592
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:17,250
information before so you're going to be

593
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,540
visible if you participate in all these

594
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,220
repositories and for him sharing your

595
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,290
knowledge your knowledge is very

596
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:27,070
positive you can use different channels

597
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:29,399
technology now allows us to write and to

598
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:32,409
participate in many different platforms

599
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,830
share information in your social network

600
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:38,260
become a reference person of reference

601
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,429
and in sharing this type of

602
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,430
cybersecurity information

603
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,440
this is going to help you create your

604
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:50,600
personal image and your professional

605
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:55,010
image also you need to take care of your

606
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,179
network of your contact network it is

607
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:02,360
true that's important to participate

608
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:11,750
read or to write on a blog but it's also

609
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:14,629
important to have a contact network for

610
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,890
example you also need to be very present

611
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,900
on social media such as LinkedIn etc

612
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:23,630
yeah for me this is it is very important

613
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,670
to socialize through social media so

614
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,929
it's not a fact of accumulating

615
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:33,530
followers or contacts you don't have to

616
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:36,200
just add in people I love meeting the

617
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:40,910
people the people or the person that may

618
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,860
be behind an avatar I like meeting face

619
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,890
to face these people these the people

620
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,300
that I follow it's just not a matter of

621
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,640
accumulating followers it's a matter of

622
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,790
getting to know the people that behind

623
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,580
that and I've been lucky enough to meet

624
00:29:52,790 --> 00:30:03,830
face to face people that I've contacted

625
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:07,970
through social media in the end here we

626
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:11,149
all get alone so we have created a huge

627
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:16,220
group of friends that after conventions

628
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:19,280
we go out for a dinner and it creates

629
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:23,570
and generates a unity because to look

630
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,800
for your contact network is quite

631
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:27,919
valuable

632
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,860
you need to have all those contacts in

633
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,470
your back pack in addition to you your

634
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:36,740
laptop and all the gadgets does the

635
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:39,110
value that you add into that empty

636
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:42,500
backpack in the symbolic backpack

637
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:46,149
because generating that contact network

638
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:50,660
is going to give you more opportunities

639
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:53,210
if you open a profile in social networks

640
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,370
just to see what they're publishing

641
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:57,770
you're not going to grow in the social

642
00:30:55,370 --> 00:31:00,379
part you need to communicate with each

643
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:03,740
other you need to be glad for all the

644
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:07,850
people's success you need to share your

645
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:13,490
success CEO the social part includes for

646
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:18,250
our social media and social networks in

647
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:24,470
addition you need to fool your inner

648
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:26,659
backpack I always carry out empty when I

649
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:30,020
go to school you know them to raise

650
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:35,510
awareness within among children and

651
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:38,299
teenagers so that's what you need to put

652
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:41,450
into your empty backpack you need to

653
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:43,760
find your own differential value you

654
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,250
know that you promote yourselves you

655
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,070
know to know how to offer yourself on

656
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,620
social media and on social networks and

657
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:54,139
that's why you need to analyze

658
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,149
yourselves you need to think what makes

659
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:00,350
you unique and you know that you figure

660
00:31:56,149 --> 00:32:04,100
out what value you can contribute with

661
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:07,209
to society and to the field of cyber

662
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,709
security you need to analyze yourselves

663
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:12,590
you need to see what you can highlight

664
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:15,620
but you also need to take into account

665
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,658
the other is opinion what they think of

666
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,469
you what they value as positive and as

667
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:23,299
negative from you talk to each other

668
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:26,270
because you need to get that feedback

669
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:30,710
you know that you know what to do next

670
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:32,480
what your next steps will be so in a

671
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,360
decent you analyzing yourself you need

672
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,309
to ask the others around you to see how

673
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,110
they see you you need to have your own

674
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:45,440
interview but it is important to have

675
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,520
into account the external opinion on

676
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,480
yourself

677
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:53,990
because maybe you do not appreciate

678
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:57,679
those things that other people may may

679
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:59,720
appreciate some people will will tell

680
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,680
you hey you're very good at this you

681
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,170
need to keep on working on that

682
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,900
you need to keep on developing that

683
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:10,290
attitude so you need to have your vision

684
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:12,780
what's your professional dream what are

685
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:17,790
the values you identify yourself with

686
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:19,889
and within that inner analysis you need

687
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:22,050
to incorporate the opinion of people

688
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:27,180
around you and you need to find your

689
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:30,540
differential value your added value to

690
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:32,940
it you have to add all the skills and

691
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:36,000
abilities and that's very important

692
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:40,070
because you need to out stand from the

693
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,680
rest of people with your new value I

694
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:48,379
told you before that you have more time

695
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:51,180
now but your training will never be over

696
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:54,750
even if you have a degree in and

697
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:57,090
university master's degree because you

698
00:33:54,750 --> 00:34:00,360
need to keep on a continuously learning

699
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:02,820
and Technology is not static technology

700
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,770
is always advancing criminal cyber

701
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:10,650
criminals will always be improving so it

702
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:14,850
requires from you to keep on learning

703
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:18,960
because every day you find new stories

704
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:21,420
new kind of cyber crimes two days

705
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,429
without reading the technology news it

706
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:28,520
is like 10 years went by so you need to

707
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:31,859
add more things to that physical

708
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:34,889
backpack you have the physical backpack

709
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:39,810
and your inner backpack your brain your

710
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:42,750
skills your values attitude and fashion

711
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:49,739
of course if you are not passionate if

712
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:53,460
you're not willing then it doesn't make

713
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:56,100
any sense whatever you do you need to do

714
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,010
it with passion because you will convey

715
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:01,140
that passion to the others and when

716
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:05,010
somebody is passionate about something

717
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:07,740
you cannot hesitate their eyes are

718
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,600
different the way of speaking about it

719
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,520
is different and that is very

720
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,460
appreciated

721
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:16,850
that is very valuable if you like it if

722
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:18,920
it's your if it's your willingness if

723
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:21,680
this is your passion go for it

724
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:28,130
so what professional skills are more

725
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:32,509
appreciated normal days these are the

726
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:36,260
skills that human resources staff value

727
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:40,210
in professionals you know that we have a

728
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:45,140
greater contribution in their team's

729
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:48,830
skills are important in cross-cutting

730
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:53,029
teams in addition to everything attitude

731
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:54,799
on top and knowledge obviously the team

732
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,630
is not going to have all the same

733
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,520
knowledge because he didn't make sense

734
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:03,470
to have a team made of professionals

735
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,960
with same certifications same

736
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:08,810
qualifications same skills we do not

737
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,840
work want robots robots will come in the

738
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:13,490
future and they will do their tasks but

739
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,830
what professional skills are more

740
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:18,319
appreciated nowadays one of them is

741
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:21,049
adaptability adaptability means that I

742
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,710
have I can be flexible and I can adapt

743
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:27,500
in order to reach targets you do not

744
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:30,170
have to just say yes yes I can do it you

745
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,750
just have to be flexible and adapt

746
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:35,030
yourself to different problems to

747
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:38,540
different challenges to different work

748
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:41,690
groups to different things that happen

749
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:45,320
every day so if there are any changes I

750
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:49,850
need to be able to adapt them I need to

751
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:52,100
have flexibility in order to show my

752
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:56,450
attitude and passion in every challenge

753
00:36:52,100 --> 00:37:00,140
I might find also problems analysis it

754
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:02,990
is very much appreciated to incorporate

755
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:07,330
in a group in a team in a professional

756
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:11,390
team a person who can who is quite an

757
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:15,259
analytic which means that they have a

758
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:18,529
broad perspective in order to identify

759
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:21,590
problems and solutions usually when we

760
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,650
are facing a problem we try to solve it

761
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,530
from the begin

762
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:28,440
into the end sometimes eight years it is

763
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:31,650
easier to cut it into small pieces in

764
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:36,330
order to solve each piece at a time and

765
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:38,520
that analytic reasoning is quite

766
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:41,190
important and is going to be supported

767
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:46,020
by all the knowledge that we carry in

768
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:48,900
our backpack continuous learning is also

769
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:53,340
very important we need to incorporate

770
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:55,950
new knowledge throughout our life Alex

771
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:58,950
said that the day he stops being

772
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:06,779
passionate about this he will grow some

773
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:10,620
Tomatoes and personally I think if I

774
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:13,980
stop wanting to learn from people around

775
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:18,000
me I won't have any reason to leave

776
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:22,370
because learning from others it is very

777
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,740
important and other important skill is

778
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:28,230
self-management

779
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:31,220
you don't need to ask absolutely

780
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:34,410
everything I'm not saying you just go

781
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:39,419
freelance and do whatever you want you

782
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:43,920
need to be organized and these is added

783
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:46,380
to the problem analysis skill in your

784
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,930
daily life you're going to face many

785
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,270
challenges they're going to require it a

786
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,040
lot from you in from you and you need to

787
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:56,940
organize yourself you need to organize

788
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,029
your time and that's essential when

789
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,870
working in a in a team you need to

790
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:06,300
understand how to do your tasks you're

791
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,549
not working on your own you have people

792
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:12,030
around you you will get information from

793
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:15,840
many places you need to learn is this

794
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:18,690
urgent is this important when is it due

795
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:21,390
you need to manage your time and your

796
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:25,470
energy when facing those challenges you

797
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:28,670
need to be able to manage your time and

798
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:32,129
to prioritize between priorities

799
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:34,500
urgencies obviously you're always going

800
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:38,520
to be told everything is urgent but you

801
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:43,320
to distinguish between what is really

802
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:47,580
urgent and what is less urgent it is

803
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:50,340
urgent to give in to handing a project

804
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:54,420
in two days but if an emergency happens

805
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:57,270
and computers stop working then that's

806
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,550
more urgent so depending on what is

807
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:03,570
going around you need to distinguish

808
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:07,340
between different urgencies what else do

809
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:11,000
you need creativity and lateral thinking

810
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:14,099
so you need to think out-of-the-box and

811
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,400
hackers go far beyond the apply

812
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:21,920
creativity and imagination in order to

813
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:26,520
solve any problem any security incident

814
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:29,849
any class project you always need to

815
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:33,210
apply that lateral thinking that is why

816
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:37,830
we say that hackers thinking goes far

817
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:39,960
beyond you cannot stay in the thinking

818
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:42,000
this is just like this no maybe you need

819
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,070
to think out of the box so maybe you can

820
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,320
apply this knowledge to another field

821
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:49,440
and you always need to question things

822
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:52,070
you need to ask yourselves and why why

823
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,170
am I doing this you need to have your

824
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:58,310
creativity for example to create your

825
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:02,010
own internet networked home from and

826
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:06,390
what is also very valuable as for

827
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:08,790
professional skills it is quite evident

828
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:11,400
but you need to know how to communicate

829
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:14,099
to others you need to develop those

830
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,500
communication skills and when I say

831
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:20,240
communication skills I'm not saying just

832
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:23,369
speaking and adapting the message to

833
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,729
your team or maybe to your comfort or a

834
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:30,570
conference or to a client you also need

835
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:34,680
to have good writing skills because

836
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:37,340
maybe you are very familiar with your

837
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,770
technician with your tech

838
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:43,770
technician language but that language

839
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:46,590
has to be understood by anyone

840
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:48,930
maybe people above you like your bosses

841
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:52,050
or your clients so you need to organize

842
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:55,440
your ideas and to give them an

843
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:58,350
instructor and an organization maybe you

844
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,570
think I do not like speak in public I

845
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:06,270
mean when you're speaking with clients

846
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:08,460
that's already speaking in public of

847
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:11,009
course it is different to give a speech

848
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,440
or to speak with your client but

849
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:16,320
communication is very important in both

850
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,770
cases and also nonverbal communication

851
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:22,320
is important you cannot say okay I'm

852
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:25,080
just working with computers that's my

853
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,440
space no because otherwise you would

854
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:31,110
fall into the idea idea into the

855
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,740
collective idea of the hacker which is

856
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:38,520
concealed in a basement with a hoodie

857
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:41,640
and working with gadgets no you need to

858
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:45,810
work in teams we do not want people to

859
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,910
be to be concealed in a room and not

860
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:50,070
speaking with anybody no you need to

861
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:53,009
speak with your team's you know you need

862
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:54,510
to know what your colleague is working

863
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:58,260
on you need to know what they're doing

864
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:59,910
in order to be able to solve security

865
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,180
incidents in a better way

866
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:06,450
teamwork is so important and you need to

867
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,850
get used to working with people from

868
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:11,100
different fields because cross-cutting

869
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:15,120
skills are very important in

870
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:19,529
cybersecurity Alex and I have been lucky

871
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:24,799
enough to have participated in the first

872
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:28,310
University League in cybersecurity

873
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:34,020
University teams were made of

874
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:37,470
communication people security people so

875
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:40,980
people from all fields if I understand a

876
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:43,890
what I can understand what cybersecurity

877
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,680
is but I need to be in touch with

878
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:48,750
something from legal department in order

879
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:53,100
to have a complete

880
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:57,660
team people think I'm very good at this

881
00:43:53,100 --> 00:44:00,420
and then we realize that unity

882
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,310
communicate you need to work on social

883
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:06,690
media as well so you need to promote

884
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:12,830
these kinds of things you need to leave

885
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:15,780
aside the the part of fear of course

886
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:17,730
leadership is another important

887
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,910
professional skills you need to have

888
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:24,150
some abilities in order to make some

889
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:29,700
influence on some people on many

890
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:34,560
occasions leadership is it's a thought

891
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:37,830
to be to be bossy and it's not the same

892
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,170
you need to be an example for the rest

893
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:43,980
of the team you need to motivate and to

894
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:45,270
encourage your team you need to make an

895
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,790
influence on them

896
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:50,940
people say I'm a leader I know how to

897
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:55,290
send orders no of course not you are

898
00:44:50,940 --> 00:45:00,060
just being bossy so you need to make to

899
00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:05,970
exert that influence do you think that

900
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:07,620
we are forgetting anything we said that

901
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:10,500
in the backpack

902
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:15,290
there were many gadgets but we wanted

903
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:19,860
you to understand that hackers backpack

904
00:45:15,290 --> 00:45:22,320
is yourself I mean that's why we have

905
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:25,680
applied our personal opinion here to

906
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,570
tell you what to carry because every

907
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,549
backpack backpack is going to be

908
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:33,200
different my backpack is going to be

909
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:36,780
different from your lambdas of course

910
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:39,419
but knowing if I know what Alex carries

911
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,910
what you carry in your backpack maybe it

912
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:45,780
can help me to know what to include in

913
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:47,629
mine of course every backpack is going

914
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,740
to be different but you can always

915
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:57,200
include something else that anyone can

916
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:57,200
can have giving you a piece of advice

917
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:06,600
another important point and basic point

918
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:11,730
this is quite graphic right you need to

919
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:13,980
be coherent between how you are and how

920
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:16,230
you say you are have to be communicative

921
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:19,170
you have to participate in four you need

922
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:22,620
to make new contacts if I have a contact

923
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:26,430
network and say I am this person and

924
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:29,609
when meeting that person is not real

925
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:32,310
that's not good you cannot pretend to be

926
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:35,790
someone you or not you are the way you

927
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:37,710
are and you need to be coherent lies do

928
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:41,970
not lead to anything good

929
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:48,090
because Liars are caught very easily if

930
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:50,779
I create false profile saying that I am

931
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:54,240
a huge professional and then you do not

932
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:56,820
prove to have professional values you're

933
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,459
not going to be as appreciated so you

934
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:05,790
need to be coherent in order not to end

935
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:08,490
up like Pinocchio big liar but people

936
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:11,790
noticed when others are lying maybe your

937
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:15,000
nose want to grow but you can smell you

938
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:18,029
can feel the smell of a life when you

939
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,690
meet somebody and they are not as they

940
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:24,000
said they were what else you need to be

941
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:27,960
professional but you need to be human

942
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,980
unitive feel empathy because we are

943
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:34,200
solving security incidents that can have

944
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:37,710
affected people we are communicating

945
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:40,080
with clients which are people we are

946
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:43,140
meeting people so you're going to

947
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:45,480
interact with people from all the fields

948
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,730
who also have their own problems you

949
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:51,510
need to understand all the stakeholders

950
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:53,640
within this incident some people can

951
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:59,270
have a good day or a bad day that's why

952
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,270
you need to place yourself in the other

953
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:07,379
Suzy just don't have to tell all juries

954
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,760
to people you need to take into account

955
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,150
how they can see

956
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:18,000
you need to place yourself in the other

957
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:23,000
lives you also need to be humble you

958
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:28,670
don't have to help that much ego these

959
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:32,940
tablets should be affordable to anyone

960
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:36,630
we wouldn't have to buy those tablets

961
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:39,540
but ego is there let's be realistic

962
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:43,590
these applies to all industries and

963
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:52,500
sectors so the hue-hue mill damascena

964
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:54,720
can heal vanity egoism pride you think

965
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,440
if you think you're the best you're an

966
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,529
expert you don't need anything else no

967
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,900
take this tablet because there is always

968
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:06,360
going to be somebody who's who knows

969
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:09,720
better than you and that's good I mean I

970
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:12,050
like to be with people who know more

971
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:15,779
than me because I will be able to learn

972
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:18,120
so I can take advantage of their

973
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,360
knowledge in order to exchange those

974
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:24,779
insights I cannot think I am the best in

975
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,730
a field because there is always going to

976
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,920
be somebody who knows something that I

977
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:32,010
don't know I always say that I'm in

978
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:34,590
sponge mode in order to absorb new

979
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:36,510
knowledge from other people so today you

980
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:39,870
may think that you don't need any help

981
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:43,590
but in two days you may need it so you

982
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:47,100
need to decrease your ego in order to

983
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:49,980
work in team to work with people from

984
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:52,500
other fields so maybe these talents

985
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:55,620
should be prescribed to some people in

986
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:59,670
order to reduce their ego being humble

987
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:02,910
is not lower in your head being humble

988
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:08,520
is being coherent and do not feel you

989
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:11,580
are better than anyone else show you as

990
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:15,420
you are I mean you need to act as you

991
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:18,180
are that's the best way of acting this

992
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,930
is me and this is what I know what to do

993
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,960
but you

994
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:25,890
do not need to think I am the best in

995
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:30,779
this room and obviously you need to be

996
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:34,950
grateful because you want to be able to

997
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:37,740
fill your pack on your own you need to

998
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:40,230
be grateful with the people around you

999
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,009
because in the end they will feel your

1000
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:44,010
backpack

1001
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:46,500
little by little you need to feel that

1002
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:48,059
backpack with insights from others with

1003
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,640
knowledge from others you need to

1004
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:52,770
increase your human values you need to

1005
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,680
increase your knowledge some colleagues

1006
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:57,059
are going to recommend you some

1007
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:02,730
qualifications some studies you're going

1008
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:06,119
to teach you something that you may need

1009
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:08,309
to work on those colleagues are going to

1010
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:11,849
make the journey much more interesting

1011
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:14,339
because doing a journey on your own can

1012
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:16,500
be good at some point but you're not

1013
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:18,720
going to get very far because you're

1014
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:22,470
going to be bored you need to fill that

1015
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:27,419
backpack with the help of people around

1016
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:30,209
you I hope you have understood what you

1017
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:32,789
need to put in your backpack you need to

1018
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:36,089
extend some knowledge and now you're

1019
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:38,970
open to be grateful so thank you very

1020
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:41,578
much cyber camp for giving us the

1021
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:43,770
opportunity to share with you these

1022
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:47,390
pieces of advice of what to put in your

1023
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:47,390
hackers backpack thank you

1024
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:58,660
I don't know if you have any question

1025
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:03,640
somebody who wants to share some

1026
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:09,310
thoughts are you carrying a backpack

1027
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:12,609
good good morning I wanted to ask what

1028
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:15,400
kind of books do you read you said you

1029
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:22,210
read many books but I don't know if

1030
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:24,900
those biographies or books is

1031
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:28,120
specialized oh I read everything

1032
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:31,120
technical books and any kind of

1033
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:33,549
literature that can be interesting

1034
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:37,870
you're going to learn from everything in

1035
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:43,590
order to have a broader view so if your

1036
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:46,600
time allows you read about fields that

1037
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:49,180
maybe now you're not interested in but

1038
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:52,089
they can be useful for the future you

1039
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:55,589
need to find a balance you need to look

1040
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:58,600
for things related to your field but you

1041
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:03,090
don't have to focus only on technical

1042
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:05,770
books people write articles on some

1043
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:09,580
topics and that can help you to have a

1044
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:12,759
clear vision of course you need to carry

1045
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:15,190
if you follow your own opinion of course

1046
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:18,160
there are not five essential books that

1047
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:20,920
you can read I cannot recommend any of

1048
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:25,960
you quicker in the end you need to do

1049
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:28,660
your own journey and as you as time goes

1050
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:32,800
by you will realize what books can

1051
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:36,970
interests you the most and if you don't

1052
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:41,020
have a physical book you can look for

1053
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:44,770
information in forum because maybe what

1054
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:48,730
interests you it is quite new and quite

1055
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:52,690
recent and there is not any book on on

1056
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:57,370
that topic but look for that topic clean

1057
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:59,859
although in other memes in for and so on

1058
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:02,828
thank you

1059
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:05,859
any other question or do you want to

1060
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:10,239
share what you carry in your backpack oh

1061
00:54:05,859 --> 00:54:12,759
look another one with a backpack yes I

1062
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:17,829
also carry a backpack but a different

1063
00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:22,869
one I want to ask you around a regarding

1064
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:29,880
laboratory see if you have an i5 laptop

1065
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:33,249
with an 8gb RAM say I have two questions

1066
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:36,849
how did you start with your own

1067
00:54:33,249 --> 00:54:39,368
laboratory and secondly if you had to

1068
00:54:36,849 --> 00:54:43,660
start now what would you start from

1069
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:47,200
would you buy raspberry and create a web

1070
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:51,160
service so well first question how I

1071
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:54,368
started with laptops and with pieces of

1072
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,629
laptops that people were giving me in

1073
00:54:54,369 --> 00:55:02,349
order to fix them so I started to

1074
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:05,950
arrange operating systems and computers

1075
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:10,180
today I would virtualize environments I

1076
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:14,259
would use computers economic computers

1077
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:17,129
from all the manufacturers and then I

1078
00:55:14,259 --> 00:55:19,900
would start virtualization I would

1079
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:22,690
launch applications and services to

1080
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:24,880
understand how they work I did this you

1081
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:27,160
know that to understand how things

1082
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,700
worked in the only way for me to

1083
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,920
understand it was to build my own web

1084
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:38,489
server for example or my own internet

1085
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:42,759
network to the firewall to create a

1086
00:55:38,489 --> 00:55:47,529
firewall on my own has given me a chance

1087
00:55:42,759 --> 00:55:51,549
to create my mini soap at my place but I

1088
00:55:47,529 --> 00:55:54,190
did it over years and years I had to

1089
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:57,700
save the log I have to work on holidays

1090
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:59,529
in order to get some gadgets today I

1091
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:04,538
would start with laptops with a

1092
00:55:59,529 --> 00:56:08,880
Raspberry Pi or Intel look equipments

1093
00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:08,880
and to start creating virtual machines

1094
00:56:10,499 --> 00:56:14,339
any other question

1095
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,660
nobody wants to share all the things

1096
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:22,380
that you carry in your backpack because

1097
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:25,960
we also want to learn from you

1098
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:31,810
hello congratulations for your

1099
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:36,100
presentation I'm a bit old but I really

1100
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:40,420
like cybersecurity although I haven't

1101
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:41,920
had the chance of being in this field

1102
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:45,460
Alex would you give me the opportunity

1103
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:49,480
to be part of your team of course I mean

1104
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:53,070
H is not important attitude is probably

1105
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:59,110
your life experience in all the fields

1106
00:56:53,070 --> 00:57:02,770
can be can be an asset for the team it

1107
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:06,250
can be used to encourage people with

1108
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:09,730
your life experience and probably your

1109
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:14,220
backpack carries a vital experience

1110
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:19,260
which on many occasions is not valued in

1111
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:24,250
society I mean it is not enough valued

1112
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:26,950
maybe you're asking youth and many other

1113
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:29,410
things and sometimes that's incompatible

1114
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:33,160
because if you want me to couple that

1115
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:36,750
skills a probably I have to be older you

1116
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:40,660
know that you have greater experiences

1117
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:44,830
vital experience is very important ok

1118
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:54,250
you are invited to the one that I a

1119
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:57,930
cyber security convention any other

1120
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:57,930
thoughts any other questions

1121
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,959
[Music]

1122
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:15,490
hello congratulations on your

1123
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:17,830
presentation as for programming language

1124
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:20,520
that you think I should start with you

1125
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:24,160
know that you understand everything

1126
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:26,040
easier which one would you pick well I'm

1127
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,609
not going to recommend you

1128
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:31,970
one specifically but start with the one

1129
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:36,300
that do you feel more comfortable with

1130
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:38,640
because any programming language is

1131
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:41,010
going to help you to organize ideas if

1132
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:45,839
you like Python use Python if you want

1133
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:48,750
to go let's go for it or JavaScript pick

1134
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:51,690
a language and start learning and

1135
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:55,140
probably as time goes by you will

1136
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:57,720
realize you want to learn another one

1137
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:03,200
but first you need to organize your mind

1138
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:05,879
before starting to type code so first

1139
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:09,000
you need to learn that part and then

1140
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:12,060
take code that you need is the one that

1141
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:18,930
adapts better to your needs for example

1142
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:25,410
I have my own repository of scripts yeah

1143
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:27,930
those crates might be quite easy but it

1144
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:30,410
helped me to start so first you need to

1145
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:32,669
organize your mind you need to

1146
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:35,790
understand these structures in order to

1147
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:37,470
apply these to code yeah you need to

1148
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:39,750
feel more comfortable with that

1149
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:42,180
programming language because when you

1150
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:44,970
move to another one it will be easier

1151
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:49,200
for you if you have already understood a

1152
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:54,029
structure then syntax is gonna come

1153
