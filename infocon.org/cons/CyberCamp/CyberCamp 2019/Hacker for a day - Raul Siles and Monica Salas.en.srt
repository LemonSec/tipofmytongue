2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:20,369
good afternoon everyone I'm going to

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:24,300
present the expectations of this course

4
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:27,029
it is introduction course to

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,630
cybersecurity topics in order to

6
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,590
understand also how technology works you

7
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,980
know that for you to feel more

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:40,969
interested in tempering the technology

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,180
so that it works in a different way

10
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:48,329
this is a workshop so this is not a

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,300
present just a speech I need you to

12
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:57,059
interact and we're going to try many

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:59,730
things as many as time permits it is

14
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:04,199
difficult for me to reach you from the

15
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:07,560
stage but if at some point you want to

16
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,520
come forward no problem for those who

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,409
are on streaming obviously they can see

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,420
the curse but they would be able to

19
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,720
interact which is the most interesting

20
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:23,570
part of the curse I am now Zyliss I work

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:27,180
at Dino SEC I work on cybersecurity

22
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:31,439
topics for a very long time because I'm

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:37,439
quite interested in technology before

24
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:41,220
starting I would like to try for you to

25
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,398
practice and to draw conclusions from

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,490
your technology so maybe you can use

27
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,939
your mobile device because I am sure you

28
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,060
all have either a smartphone or a tablet

29
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,929
so that you can know what to do with

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:01,469
these devices how many of you handle

31
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,370
technology I am sure that probably you

32
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,830
would have

33
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,680
a laboratory like the one on the picture

34
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:11,410
but you like playing with technology I

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,180
guess most of you I guess that's the

36
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:17,470
reason why you're here

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:22,020
okay we're gonna try to get to know our

38
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,580
mobile devices for that I need your

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,780
interaction so that you can learn things

40
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:33,280
and practice things okay so what we're

41
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:39,970
going to do is block your mobile phone

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:46,450
please or your mobile device do you have

43
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:50,350
any access code to in order for the

44
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:55,329
owner to access the device how many of

45
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:58,030
you have an access code who doesn't no

46
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,160
one wants to raise the hand so that we

47
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:04,290
don't point them okay

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:08,670
how many of you have pin code so

49
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:14,620
four-digit number how many of you have a

50
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:17,350
pattern those who raise your hand

51
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,370
we know you have Android because iOS

52
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:25,239
doesn't have a pattern a password I mean

53
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,750
alphanumeric password less people but

54
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:34,959
still some of you how many of you use

55
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:37,030
biometrics most of you okay it is

56
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,820
fashionable right now later we're going

57
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,230
to see something quite interesting which

58
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,269
is how to disable in a fast way

59
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,649
biometrics and the scenarios were this

60
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:55,030
can be useful and regarding biome

61
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:58,590
biometrics who use digital print and who

62
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:01,150
uses facial recognition okay I

63
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,459
understand that no one has iris

64
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:09,340
recognition because some Android devices

65
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:14,829
do have this option okay to unblock the

66
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:17,488
device and see how long it takes you let

67
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:17,489
us know please

68
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:26,509
one second what did you use biometrics

69
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:30,320
pattern the pattern were used to wipe

70
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:33,380
your finger dancing require a long time

71
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,509
biometrics is even faster but when you

72
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,870
have to enter a password it gets more

73
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:42,139
complicated and the user is the one who

74
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:47,419
is upset by entering a complex of a

75
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:51,320
numeric password more things if you

76
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:58,760
block the mobile device against and you

77
00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:05,510
see the screen do you know all the icons

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:09,409
in your screen when it is blocked the if

79
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:12,409
you have any comments or thoughts or you

80
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:17,060
have some icon which you hadn't seen

81
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:21,470
before you can share this the idea is

82
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:24,320
for you to see if you know your device

83
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:28,039
in depth later we're going to ask you

84
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,389
what you're seeing on the screen because

85
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:34,159
you have to take into account that

86
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:39,710
anyone can see they blocked a screen

87
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:42,289
content for example the star or the

88
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,229
telephone company for example orange

89
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:49,419
movie star yoga you all see that right

90
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:54,320
so someone could use this information to

91
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:59,000
create a fake company's telephone

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:03,310
station so that your phone connects to

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,479
it can you see any information on your

94
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:12,710
operating system on that screen would

95
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,919
you know which ones are Android or iOS

96
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:21,830
yeah the physical power it is easier

97
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:28,820
right what version of operating system

98
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:39,919
do you have look it up maybe we can use

99
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:43,389
Kahoot we have a couple in order to make

100
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,849
it more interactive we're going to use

101
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:50,710
Kahoot questionnaires in order to know

102
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:53,870
your operating system version I

103
00:06:50,710 --> 00:07:00,650
understand that all of you are connected

104
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:04,639
to Wi-Fi or to 4G for those who are at

105
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:09,169
home you can also participate in code

106
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:15,940
online so we should see the answers

107
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:15,940
you're giving us we have an audience of

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,560
teenagers families and so on depending

109
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:28,460
on how the works of girls we will play

110
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,490
with this so I present you I am gonna

111
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,310
introduce monica seles my colleague as

112
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,560
dino sec both of us are going to present

113
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,320
this course I hadn't introduced her

114
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,860
before due to your reason I will explain

115
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:46,610
later ok so we're going to play Kahoot

116
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:51,710
so we're going to change the screen so

117
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:54,740
that anyone can see the screen and so

118
00:07:51,710 --> 00:08:02,779
that you have enough time to connect to

119
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:06,110
the internet I'm going to show you where

120
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:08,960
to find the version of operating system

121
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:23,210
and the level of patches for Android

122
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:28,479
devices ok we're going to do the

123
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:31,479
workshop option you need to enter food

124
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,479
mighty

125
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:46,269
WWWE and you enter this pin you choose

126
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,410
nickname and you will be already

127
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:53,529
connected we are seeing new users who

128
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,899
are getting connected I'm going to give

129
00:08:53,529 --> 00:09:04,019
you some time so that you have enough

130
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:04,019
time to connect and let's see your

131
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:19,930
operating system you have 60 seconds for

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:22,779
each question ok so let's start it is

133
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,870
not about competing it is to challenge

134
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:29,800
yourselves so the first one is for

135
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:32,829
Android so you have four options for

136
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,319
Android so where can I see the version

137
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:39,209
of operating system in Android in

138
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:42,180
settings operating system in settings

139
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:46,750
information of phone version of Android

140
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:51,939
jello is a settings system system update

141
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:56,500
and green is settings security screen

142
00:09:51,939 --> 00:10:00,730
lock okay since we are in Android

143
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:08,589
how many people have Android 10 only one

144
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:11,100
person - two people okay not bad ok I

145
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:15,519
couldn't see because of the light

146
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:19,029
Android 10 was launched in August this

147
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:24,490
year and we are in December who has

148
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:39,009
Android 9 ok around 10 people or so

149
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:44,660
ok Android 8 Android 706 I guess that

150
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:53,660
the rest of you has Iost

151
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:57,510
so 23 people chose the correct answer

152
00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:03,449
Vernie is the first one who answered and

153
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:07,140
let's move on to iOS so where can you

154
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:11,850
find your iOS version read optional

155
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:20,010
settings general software update who has

156
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:28,950
iost 13 from those who have iOS 13 2 3

157
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:31,500
does the latest version from Rakatan I

158
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:36,260
was told that it is mourning a

159
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:39,720
vulnerability was published which was

160
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:45,329
compromised in hotels in Europe and in

161
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:47,550
Asia in order to attack the guests so it

162
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:55,680
is better to have the latest version who

163
00:11:47,550 --> 00:12:03,300
has Iost 12 is 11 those who have older

164
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:08,250
versions from Android if he's less than

165
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:12,029
hundred ten or iOS 13 you have a device

166
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:17,870
with high number of vulnerabilities so

167
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:17,870
from the point of view of security it is

168
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,750
difficult act okay this is the podium

169
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:38,250
and ok I had more time to check where to

170
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:42,120
find these informations ok do you

171
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:45,779
already know your iOS version let's

172
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:50,370
change the screen from the point of view

173
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:53,600
of security and we will give you some

174
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,600
more examples on it

175
00:12:53,790 --> 00:13:00,640
diversion is quite important

176
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:04,959
do you have any localization surfaces

177
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:10,250
can you see it from your screen block

178
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:13,190
who has localization services do you

179
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:17,390
know if you can see them from the screen

180
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:21,500
from the lock screen yes there are some

181
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:25,460
games which use localization systems

182
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:29,510
such as pokemons go and some other

183
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:32,900
people use these services to take public

184
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:36,700
transport and to look on maps could I

185
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:39,590
see if those services are being used

186
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,740
sometimes yes that depends on these

187
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:48,610
settings but there is an icon which

188
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:53,050
indicates their VIN used there was a

189
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:59,030
question on the same disabling

190
00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:01,640
biometrics do you think of a scenario

191
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:15,050
where you think it is necessary to

192
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:22,040
disable biometrics no no no one a place

193
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:25,240
packed with people if they steal your

194
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,240
device you mean

195
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:39,070
imagine your device is blocked but you

196
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:42,110
can unblock it through biometrics the

197
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:46,840
you may know you need to think of a

198
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:51,980
scenario where you need to disable

199
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:56,930
biometrics for some reason have you ever

200
00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:00,560
seen videos the typical video of a boy

201
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:03,859
that attacks his father this is very

202
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,520
Spanish that attacks his father because

203
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,070
he's sleeping he's taking a nap and

204
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:14,270
takes his finger to unblock the

205
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:17,930
device that's not the most critical

206
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:20,449
example that's the example we had for

207
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:23,120
the family part but we can adapt it no

208
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:34,040
no no no the typical example in these

209
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:35,600
cases is in the technical part I'm I for

210
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,680
example I'm flying to the United States

211
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:44,780
and in the customs they tell me that I

212
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:46,900
have to block to unblock the screen do

213
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:53,120
you know that the Fifth Amendment

214
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:56,750
doesn't allow you to make you do to this

215
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,600
amendment you may have forgotten your

216
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,420
PIN code and it is not compulsory for

217
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,170
you to do it but biometrics

218
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:09,650
is not included in the fifth amendment

219
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:12,709
so you may say I have forgotten my PIN

220
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:19,010
code but they may ask you to put your

221
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:24,500
finger on the on the screen also let's

222
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:27,110
think of a boy or a teenager who is in a

223
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:33,170
place where he thinks he's going to be

224
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:38,660
stolen so if somebody steals his phone

225
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:41,510
and passes it in front of your face they

226
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,730
can unblock it in those cases we always

227
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:47,090
say give your mobile phone away I mean

228
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:52,070
it is your life is more important but

229
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:57,140
the with biometrics they may not

230
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:59,660
actually access the mobile phone do you

231
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,330
know do you know how to disable

232
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:05,470
biometrics without having to access

233
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:09,410
settings I mean I'm not talking about

234
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:12,770
unregister your pin code but about

235
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:19,130
deleting that option in a fast way I'm

236
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:21,760
gonna show you so you it is easier to

237
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,760
understand

238
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:32,890
okay here it is in both Android and iOS

239
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:39,250
devices there is you need to have

240
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:40,960
Android 9 if you push the start button

241
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,590
for a long time

242
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,830
you press the button for a long time

243
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:54,639
then you have several options which is

244
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:59,199
the lockdown mode here you have the

245
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:02,830
references of where to find that mode

246
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,070
which should be activated by default in

247
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:10,260
Android 9 and 10 and basically when you

248
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:14,129
have this lockdown mode you cannot used

249
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,750
biometrics among any among other options

250
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,930
so for example the first time that you

251
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:23,020
start your phone then you cannot use

252
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:25,540
biometrics if you have five attempts

253
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:30,000
failed attempts then you cannot use it

254
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:35,050
and in iOS this is associated to

255
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:40,900
emergency services so depending on using

256
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:43,120
iPhone 7 or higher is you push the start

257
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:49,690
button you press the start button five

258
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:52,149
times and then you have this screen be

259
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:57,280
careful not to call emergency service

260
00:18:52,150 --> 00:19:02,260
but if this screen appears on your phone

261
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:05,440
you have already disabled your biometric

262
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:08,020
option any new in new where iPhones you

263
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:14,980
just have you can also do it with the

264
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:22,800
volume up and down buttons next thing

265
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:22,800
we're going to do this is

266
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:30,330
the first question in this in this

267
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:35,070
training course is what is a hacker how

268
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:37,110
would you define a hacker Qualis el

269
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,629
calor prefere Deauville oscar what's the

270
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,149
favorite color of hackers let's start

271
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:44,759
with that easy question

272
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:46,590
necesitamos booster collaboration we

273
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:48,500
need your collaboration this is a

274
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:52,470
workshop we need you to participate

275
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:55,919
black right hackers always were in black

276
00:19:52,470 --> 00:20:00,330
more stereotypes plays how can you

277
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:05,039
identify a hacker the hooding right the

278
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:06,960
hood why why a hood because they want to

279
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,019
hide ourselves they want to be

280
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,629
undercover but you have also identified

281
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:13,409
them with a holder so it is not a good

282
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:18,389
strategy

283
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:21,269
what else is seed a hacker good or bad

284
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:23,850
what are his favorite numbers their

285
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:27,509
favorite numbers zeroes and ones

286
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:32,519
binary code of course this is a hacker

287
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:35,490
hood black zeros ones there we have the

288
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:39,330
Hollywood stereotypes children usually

289
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:43,889
say that they were a beard that's why I

290
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:47,519
grew my beard for today you know that to

291
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:52,229
keep on being a hacker ok according to

292
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:53,700
the Spanish language Association this is

293
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,360
the definition of a hacker

294
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:01,080
it is a computing pirate somebody that

295
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,019
illegally access computing systems in

296
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,580
order to obtain secret information so

297
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:10,529
according to this definition is it a

298
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:11,850
hacker a good guy or a bad guy according

299
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:18,090
to what you're used to

300
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:22,469
yeah it's a bad guy and what does the do

301
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:25,629
media say a hacker accessed bla bla bla

302
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:31,590
last week there were several incidents

303
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:35,610
against Spanish companies but from cyber

304
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:40,600
security from the cybersecurity

305
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:43,270
community we protested we went to talk

306
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,459
with the riotous Spanish language

307
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:47,560
association you know there for them to

308
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,860
accept another definition a person

309
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:54,220
expert in handling computing systems and

310
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,360
so on okay now we're going to need your

311
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,780
participation

312
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,340
I may force you to come to the first

313
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:07,149
rows in order to perform a real workshop

314
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:09,669
in the 13th century the term hack was

315
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:13,660
already used I'm going to ask a question

316
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:18,970
if you had six hours to cut a tree what

317
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:25,650
would you do well resume see sort of

318
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:32,890
orientation so if you had to chop thick

319
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:39,670
tree what would you do you wouldn't

320
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:43,600
start you would prepare your tools so as

321
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:46,420
Aaron Linko he said you would spend

322
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:51,010
hours preparing your tools and then you

323
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:56,710
would start the work where does the term

324
00:22:51,010 --> 00:23:01,350
hack come from from the MIT who knows

325
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:05,740
MIT who like who likes Marvel Iron Man

326
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:07,560
Stark's studied in Massachusetts

327
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:13,090
Institute of Technology

328
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:23,620
based in Boston in the 60s it had a club

329
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:28,389
of trained trained replicas and they had

330
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:31,530
these laboratory so they invented these

331
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:34,770
term for people who had innovative

332
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:37,280
solutions you know the to solve problems

333
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:41,720
with trained replicas and these was

334
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:45,149
extended to the world of technology

335
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,540
networks and so on that's for you to

336
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:51,600
know as a reference okay there are all

337
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:58,710
the hackers we're going to play a short

338
00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:03,629
video we don't want you to get bored in

339
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:07,770
order to open your mind regarding the

340
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:12,290
real meaning of hackers the video

341
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:17,280
doesn't have any sound let me play it

342
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:21,210
let's change it okay so that you can see

343
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:29,340
all the hackers who you may not have

344
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:32,510
expected to see in this workshop so this

345
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,510
is the idea of hackers

346
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:50,530
unless alguien que busca la Villa Park

347
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:53,678
it somebody who looks for alternatives

348
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:57,460
to get what they want with using their

349
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:02,590
best skills there are more interesting

350
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:05,260
examples it is quite interesting as for

351
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:16,270
the interaction they have with human

352
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:20,650
beings he is he he checks if the hammock

353
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:23,940
is secure and he is holding to the bar

354
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:28,929
because safety first there are some

355
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:31,630
others who despite their side managed to

356
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:43,679
do whatever they want to do some

357
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:46,990
interactions ok just a sec the issue of

358
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,090
interaction with locks and protection is

359
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,030
quite interesting and there are some

360
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:55,090
hackers who work in teams which is

361
00:25:52,030 --> 00:26:01,360
another interesting future this thing

362
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:05,549
work to use different members skills to

363
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:09,010
achieve a goal I think the idea is clear

364
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:13,330
Chakiris quanta cuenta Monica esta parte

365
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:16,600
yo yo yo son rata see either sophia's

366
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:20,470
know they they los caucus let's talk

367
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:33,340
about challenges that hackers need to

368
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:36,160
face ok and a multiplicand o la salida

369
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:43,770
de las doce we're duplicating the outlet

370
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:47,010
of both equipments typically when you

371
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:52,480
are facing a challenge

372
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:56,170
usually you look for the solution

373
00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:00,850
in a different way you need to extend

374
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:07,540
your analysis ability which is what any

375
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:11,560
hacker is going to do now

376
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:13,629
the side the lateral thinking or the

377
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,940
thinking outside the box concept is

378
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:20,620
quite fashionable I'm facing a problem

379
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:22,480
but I didn't I need to think of it from

380
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,449
another point of view taking into

381
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,620
account data and information for example

382
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:35,550
one of the typical challenges and we

383
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:38,590
encourage you to do it especially if

384
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:44,110
there are families watching us try to

385
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:48,870
pass through all of these cue points

386
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:56,530
with four or less lines

387
00:27:48,870 --> 00:28:00,219
yeah let's say four lines without in one

388
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:04,889
movement so the idea is to make straight

389
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,890
lines four straight lines

390
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:12,910
okay so let's try I'm gonna start here

391
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:18,510
and do four okay no the middle one was

392
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:21,700
not completed see Antonia shorten

393
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:24,640
levanta la mano if somebody has the

394
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:35,460
solution oh please raise your hand and

395
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:40,220
tell me como la alguien

396
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,220
going that somebody have figured it out

pacientes children are more impatient

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:13,140
and I use Ali tend to say no do not tell

403
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,658
me didi solution because I want to solve

404
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:20,880
it has somebody figure it out I think

405
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:22,080
somebody has no intent a similar no no

406
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,020
tell me what to do

407
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:31,918
where shall I start from from the corner

408
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:38,789
left corner to the right corner then you

409
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:41,400
go do you go to the left yet that way in

410
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:46,940
a diagonal and then you go down a

411
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:50,909
cycling that's it with any combination

412
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:54,120
from where I think outside the box I can

413
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:56,940
go through all the points because nobody

414
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:03,620
tell you you could get out of the box

415
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:06,990
typically people just see a cube they

416
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:08,939
that's why it's it's difficult to solve

417
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:12,330
it because that depends on the approach

418
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:15,809
that you're using because your head is

419
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:21,649
fixed with an idea that's the first

420
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:26,700
element lateral thinking you need to

421
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:32,720
avoid boundaries you need to prevent

422
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:34,230
yourself from putting some limits okay

423
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,460
let's do it

424
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:40,700
with only three straight lines okay you

425
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,700
got it

426
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:50,850
without in just one movement okay

427
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:57,408
without lifting your pen out of the

428
00:30:50,850 --> 00:31:01,289
paper okay that's the there's a fun part

429
00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:05,000
mobium do not get the referees what do

430
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:05,000
you mean my moving it

431
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:13,879
let's imagine this is a paper and no

432
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:25,490
matter whether how the paper is you

433
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:28,130
cannot lift your pen Gnosticism que

434
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:32,409
levantar la mano if somebody finds the

435
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,409
solution please raise your hand

436
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:44,479
Hezbollah most of escape

437
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:47,690
do you want us to say the solution if

438
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,930
you want maybe we maybe you can keep on

439
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:54,530
thinking about it and while we're on the

440
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:57,320
workshop you can comment on that okay

441
00:31:54,530 --> 00:32:01,850
I don't like to share the solution as

442
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:08,720
fast because I want someone of you to

443
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:15,949
get it can you come you Sal Thomas ah he

444
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:18,620
but effective but anyway no normal

445
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:22,880
mentee is the stopper tell a person

446
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:25,489
usually this part of the presentation we

447
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,930
do it in a different way because usually

448
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:33,500
we have more audience more people so

449
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:36,440
usually we unblock someone's phone

450
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:40,460
due to the distribution of the room it

451
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:45,140
has been complicated but I would like to

452
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:47,030
tell me if you recognize these texts the

453
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,470
station Nostradamus after being

454
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:53,750
destroyed three months ago

455
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:57,110
what please can you tell me why do you

456
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,910
know why do you do I know that you have

457
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:00,169
it

458
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:04,310
there's a ver esto no certainty I

459
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:09,890
literally thought if I know these maybe

460
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:14,960
I used telepathy and then it stopped

461
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:18,110
sending life signals how could I know it

462
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,770
in cuenta que las cartas no see hackers

463
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:25,129
do not take into account that hackers

464
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:28,970
are not always wearing a hoody they are

465
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:33,110
not always men do you know how I knew

466
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:36,140
that information well do you have

467
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:38,928
cameras you saw me type in it

468
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:42,990
no no cameras

469
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:52,350
is it because I have bluetooth activated

470
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:57,420
now it's easier than that I was behind

471
00:33:52,350 --> 00:34:02,340
you and behind you I also show a joke

472
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:08,369
her a comment saying why sloughing what

473
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:12,569
do I want to get with here your you had

474
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:16,379
a pattern since I had the information

475
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:18,659
that I needed I left before knowing your

476
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:21,690
pattern but usually I would have noticed

477
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,840
your pattern because visually it is

478
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:28,409
quite easy to read a pattern and you

479
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:31,200
were were not even aware that I was

480
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:38,460
behind you on many occasions we are not

481
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:41,908
aware of people around us and no one of

482
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:46,260
the people that I had in front of you in

483
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:49,710
front of me didn't even realize that I

484
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,690
was there I didn't wait to see your

485
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:58,050
pattern because we were running out of

486
00:34:51,690 --> 00:35:01,050
time but with numeric passwords and

487
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:09,180
pattern passwords are very easy to

488
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:14,220
identify he had a very tiny not note

489
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:16,950
block where I could read the small

490
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:20,759
characters because I I can read very

491
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:23,939
well I have a good sight and I could

492
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:27,890
wait for you to have left the room our

493
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:30,570
device has our digital life everything

494
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:33,690
everything that you can imagine of is in

495
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,550
our devices and we want to highlight the

496
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:40,230
importance of this especially for those

497
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:42,570
who have seen us through streaming the

498
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:45,780
screen access is one of the main

499
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:48,780
weaknesses of your device so before

500
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,570
entering your PIN code or any

501
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,690
confidential information

502
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:56,030
you need to be sure that no one is

503
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:58,340
around you that no one can use that

504
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:02,540
information against you especially with

505
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:06,880
your access method at this point people

506
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:10,970
do not even have a security option in

507
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,470
mobile devices which is a problem that

508
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:15,200
comes from the manufacturer

509
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:18,200
especially Android when you install the

510
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,830
operating system and you do the initial

511
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,830
settings

512
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:30,080
it lets you activate several options

513
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:37,100
that can jeopardize your security well

514
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:39,400
we have here a map of their devices well

515
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:42,980
anyway I would invite you to the blog

516
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,290
your mobile phone and let's see if

517
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:50,080
you're observing something we are well

518
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:50,080
here we have an Android 10 Android iOS

519
00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:02,840
well also want to mention that one of

520
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:06,320
the things that Android ok lets me see

521
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:13,100
AG I do not find the pointer okay here

522
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:15,680
it is so one of the things that the

523
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:18,410
Android blocking screen shows is the

524
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,919
type of blocking system that you have if

525
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:24,109
you have here the local it means that

526
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,200
the your device is locked so if I'm a

527
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,940
hacker or a criminal in this case if I'm

528
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,270
a criminal now that wants to steal a

529
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:34,310
mobile phone I'm going to see you around

530
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:38,210
we'll have to see what I have around and

531
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:40,940
look for security measures are you using

532
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:44,920
the smart lock unlocking system in

533
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,920
Android do you know what smartlock is

534
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:51,680
that's anyone not know what is it what

535
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:53,780
it is well I'm going to explain it quite

536
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,649
briefly a smart lock is an automatic

537
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:59,540
locking system and under some

538
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:02,000
circumstances the device remains

539
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,279
unlocked for example when there is a

540
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,950
Bluetooth device nearby

541
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,020
so if you're in your car and you have

542
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:14,210
coupled your phone with a Bluetooth

543
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:16,750
device the phone is going to remain

544
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:20,510
unlocked or for example next to a

545
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:24,590
SmartWatch also it allows you to unblock

546
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:27,320
it also allows you to unblock your

547
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:29,390
device when you're closer to your house

548
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,780
because it is considered to be a safe

549
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,910
place we never recommend that type of

550
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:38,300
unlocking systems especially in your

551
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:41,270
office or any other public area so the

552
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:43,820
Android locking system when it is locked

553
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:47,410
with a smart lock changes that symbol

554
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:51,520
and chose Locker surrounded by an

555
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,520
unlocking symbol

556
00:38:54,550 --> 00:39:02,510
but go move it so as you can see here in

557
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:05,330
this numeric keyboard key when you when

558
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:07,280
I'm clicking their password what's

559
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:12,470
happening what's going on here when I'm

560
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:14,240
typing the password I mean would you

561
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:23,419
know what's the password of that device

562
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:25,729
why because you are seeing that but in

563
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:30,140
order for this to be more user friendly

564
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:35,120
it allows you to see visually I mean now

565
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:37,490
they the the number that Charlie's

566
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,440
pressing has a circle around and this is

567
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:42,830
going to allow people around you to get

568
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,550
to know that password and same things

569
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:49,009
happen with the pattern the numbers are

570
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:52,910
going to light up so it doesn't you

571
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:54,500
don't need to have a very good site in

572
00:39:52,910 --> 00:40:07,370
order to be able to see that it's very

573
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:10,630
easy to visualize they are no tears

574
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,630
committed the nectar of your being

575
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:23,080
but and though there's an LP loved it

576
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:25,390
when I spoke edible condom from film

577
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:29,049
television there so depending on your

578
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:30,730
Android version and the characteristics

579
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:38,490
are different I mean the many ways

580
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:41,050
different depending on the version but

581
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:45,430
you're going to find an option that says

582
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:48,090
do you want to see the characters that

583
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:53,680
you are typing that you're introducing

584
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:57,220
you can enable or disable that option

585
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:02,819
for example in iOS this is the left

586
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:07,120
screen here if I go to touch ID password

587
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:14,470
how many did it digits has my password

588
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:16,600
in iOS 4 right this is obvious because I

589
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:18,490
just have four dots that's the area you

590
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,500
can change that you can change the

591
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:23,560
passcode you need to introduce the

592
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:27,030
previous password and you can use a pin

593
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:30,250
of six figures which would be safer than

594
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:33,100
four but you can go to this blue option

595
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:37,530
in order to choose alternative options

596
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:40,509
such as alphanumeric passwords or digit

597
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:43,960
for digit passwords or some things like

598
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:53,320
that this is not offered in Android but

599
00:41:43,960 --> 00:42:05,970
it is offered in eyes so when the device

600
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:10,230
is locked I'm going to lock it again why

601
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:12,700
why can't I lock the phone right now I

602
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:18,160
mean you can see that I am trying to

603
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:21,609
lock it and I want to unlock it and it

604
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:25,210
is unlocked directly there are two

605
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:26,750
timers you have to take into account the

606
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:34,099
inactivity

607
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:35,320
of the device when this is going to be

608
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:39,560
applied for example here it says

609
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:43,000
required access code in 15 minutes I'm

610
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:48,849
going to show this in a different way

611
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,849
I'm going to change language to Spanish

612
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:58,190
because you probably have earphones

613
00:42:52,630 --> 00:43:05,290
Spanish so here you have we had an

614
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:05,290
option that said access code and it says

615
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:12,230
which with what with which frequency

616
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:23,990
issue I should I require that password

617
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:25,280
so when I lock the device sorry but it

618
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,098
seems that we're having a problem with

619
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,260
the language chain change well Android

620
00:43:28,099 --> 00:43:32,510
is changing menus continuously and

621
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,430
depending on the version of your device

622
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:39,680
this is going to be different selves

623
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:42,140
here we had this this information in

624
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,660
adjustments now it is in privacy here

625
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,720
you have an option which is showing

626
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:50,720
passwords and it says showing characters

627
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:52,790
briefly when writing them this option is

628
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,750
activated by default in the operating

629
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:58,369
system so once we have configurated

630
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:06,099
their version we have to make sure that

631
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:06,099
this option is disabled so when you are

632
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,869
you're going to see the difference now

633
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:20,020
so that's the difference

634
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:34,400
so here besides show in that circle I

635
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:39,349
even can I can even see the figure

636
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,100
itself which is even less safe this

637
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:41,530
secure

638
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,580
so we have to make sure that this option

639
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:47,630
disabled because the characters remain

640
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:49,670
on the screen enough time to to see them

641
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:52,310
and to write them down same things with

642
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:56,530
the pattern I can see the pattern and

643
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:59,620
it's very easy afterwards to remember it

644
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:04,190
well I'm going to show you is right now

645
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:09,759
so here I have my device blocked how

646
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:13,940
many digits is the code four digits

647
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:16,970
normally I talk it shouldn't be able to

648
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:20,060
know the length of my password so it's

649
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:23,930
very important to things up correctly

650
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:27,620
and not to have and maybe we can put an

651
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:30,140
alphanumeric password or atmospher that

652
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:34,009
that's not a speci and defines the

653
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:40,960
number of of characters that we are

654
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:46,930
going to introduce so well now I've I

655
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,930
changed the password with a pattern

656
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:53,510
sorry but I think I don't think we are

657
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,520
sharing the screen but well what what

658
00:45:53,510 --> 00:46:03,200
happens with that option when we are

659
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:13,790
having a pattern is that when I sorry

660
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:18,109
but we would see the pattern the line of

661
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:20,050
the pattern on the screen so that that's

662
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:23,060
one of the options that you have to

663
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:35,570
disable when you are setting up the

664
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:37,880
device so you've probably seen these in

665
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:39,290
other environments the accessing codes

666
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,120
are used in many different environments

667
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:46,700
such as ATMs that say that you have to

668
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,529
cover the screen with your when the

669
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:53,060
keyboard with your hand when you are

670
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:56,390
right and introducing it also there are

671
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,910
some codes that are not recommended or

672
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:01,520
for example how many of you could tell

673
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:10,520
me what's the code of that door which is

674
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:14,780
locked by that panel what is it the code

675
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:17,120
the password probably three four five

676
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:23,240
six we're not sure is maybe six five

677
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:26,839
three four or something like that the

678
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:29,600
options are more limited this is the

679
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:34,160
idea that we want to convey to you with

680
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:37,700
this presentation also sometimes you are

681
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,440
publishing personal information in your

682
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,319
social media there may be related to

683
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:52,790
your coats and some people could try to

684
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:54,580
correlate that information we started

685
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:58,970
with this question do you think that

686
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:00,860
anyone could unlock your device and it

687
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:03,370
is very important to raise awareness

688
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:07,010
between children and between teenagers

689
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:08,690
because it is we need to know how to use

690
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:12,230
this type of devices we don't need to

691
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:14,240
use our code in these devices that may

692
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:17,350
be known by other people for example how

693
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:20,419
many of you have used as I code the

694
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:24,680
birthdate of a family member or a

695
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:27,920
special date I don't know that they

696
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:32,450
thought you got a dog information that

697
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:36,080
may be on social media I mean you're not

698
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:38,750
going to say my code is the day I got a

699
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:44,330
dog but maybe you can say I got a dog

700
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:47,420
today many of us may have done that we

701
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:52,930
used to link or it goes to something

702
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:55,520
that we can remember easily not long ago

703
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:58,490
well we are

704
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,340
are writing security guidelines and we

705
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:05,299
would recommend using passwords or

706
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:08,180
alphanumeric code that we're complicated

707
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,010
against biometrics but what we've seen

708
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:13,850
is that taking into account all the

709
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:19,280
configurations in setups of devices

710
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:21,650
visual passwords are more dangerous so

711
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:27,110
what we are recommending right now is to

712
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:30,290
establish password which is very solid

713
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:33,080
which is robust and and is not shared to

714
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:34,730
any other service but that you don't

715
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,549
have to introduce many times during the

716
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:42,200
day because once you introduce it maybe

717
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:44,930
I put potential attacker can see some of

718
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:47,330
the figures some of the characters some

719
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:49,700
other day he may seem some of the rest

720
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:52,250
of the characters so same thing that you

721
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:58,609
do not leave the lights on when you're

722
00:49:52,250 --> 00:50:00,850
not at home try to not avoid locking and

723
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:04,640
unlocking your device continuously I

724
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:08,060
also try to use a solid password and

725
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,100
also in other situations such as this

726
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:13,609
password this workshop you can use

727
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:15,440
biometrics we didn't recommend by a

728
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:18,080
matrix before because there are many

729
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:22,359
methods that have violated these

730
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:25,040
biometrics and this biometric parameters

731
00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:28,220
we wanted these to make a workshop which

732
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,770
is interactive so I want to ask you do

733
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:34,759
you want to know how someone can try to

734
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:39,290
break break into face idea or this type

735
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:41,990
of biometric methods okay I will show

736
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:44,420
you a couple of videos that explains how

737
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:51,080
these methods have been avoided and it

738
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:54,970
is not that high-tech method let's start

739
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:57,470
with touch ID the fingerprint reading

740
00:50:54,970 --> 00:51:01,959
system of is and then we will move to

741
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:04,390
face ID the latest version the latest

742
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:09,100
if we're talking about movies about

743
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:13,990
films how can I get access to our mobile

744
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:16,000
device of a user how can I get your

745
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:23,560
fingerprint for example in order to

746
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:29,670
access your mobile phone tape well what

747
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:33,250
happens in movies in James Bond movies

748
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:36,330
someone invites the bad guy to a whiskey

749
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:40,840
and when you are grabbing the glass the

750
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:43,840
glass already has fingerprint where is

751
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:46,530
your fingerprint in the very same device

752
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:52,710
because you are touching it all the time

753
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:56,800
so well this attack was done by a group

754
00:51:52,710 --> 00:52:01,770
which was associated to CCC Chaos

755
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:06,520
Computer Club a very well-known German

756
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:10,000
hackers group so how long do you think

757
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:12,730
did it take them to break into the

758
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:19,270
college the touch ID of iPhone of the

759
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:23,580
first iPhone 5 I think 5s since the

760
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:27,280
phone was launched a week you're saying

761
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:29,020
same day they had to buy it

762
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,960
ok we need to take that into account

763
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:37,060
they didn't have it before but 24 hours

764
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,650
the 19th of September was lunch and the

765
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,830
20th of September they published that

766
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:43,270
videos really that I'm going to show you

767
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:47,740
let's take a look at what we are doing

768
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:52,660
so they have the phone in the screen you

769
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:56,200
have the fingerprint you use a normal HP

770
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:59,680
scanner that many of us may have and I

771
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:02,020
am going to scan the screen of the pivot

772
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,600
of the mobile phone you know that to get

773
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:07,110
the fingerprint another recommendation

774
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:10,170
is that we have to wash our hands

775
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:12,530
frequently no they're not to lift many

776
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:14,750
fingerprints in our screen

777
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:16,510
I don't know if you can watch it

778
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:20,150
properly but they are going to sue me

779
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:26,800
they are grabbing a fingerprint from the

780
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:30,050
screen they get that part of the image

781
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:34,430
they invert colors you know therefore

782
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:38,510
the fingerprint to fingerprint be more

783
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:43,430
visible and now they are going to rotate

784
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:44,570
it 180 degrees so that I can use it

785
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:48,830
against the device

786
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:56,450
they've also inverted colors and again

787
00:53:48,830 --> 00:54:02,120
180 degrees rotation and they printing

788
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:05,299
this in a paper and ok this is the part

789
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:07,640
which may seem more sophisticated it's

790
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:10,700
true that these people work a lot on

791
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:14,060
biometrics but in in me this may be more

792
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:22,790
difficult they use UV lights against PCB

793
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:28,940
and this is going to give some thickness

794
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:31,790
to the fingerprints and with that well

795
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:36,560
they are going to leave that PCB that

796
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:40,759
material to impregnate it to impregnate

797
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:44,779
the fingerprint print they do a solution

798
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:46,280
with a seed and well in the end we are

799
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:54,470
creating a mold with that with that

800
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:56,510
fingerprint they fight in order to

801
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:58,580
harden that mold and they start creating

802
00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:01,910
the replicas the duplicates of the

803
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:04,970
finger feed of the victim and they just

804
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:07,160
do this with glue white glue that's used

805
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:10,669
to stick furniture do not think about

806
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:14,359
any other advanced material just with

807
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:19,670
white glue you put it in them all done

808
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:24,469
with PCB and graph Rafi and once the

809
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:26,920
view is hard to just take it from the

810
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:29,539
mold and this already gives you a

811
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:31,309
duplicate of the fingerprint of the user

812
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:33,920
and now you're going to see that it

813
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:36,229
works perfectly this is the victim who's

814
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,680
ready strain registering for the first

815
00:55:36,229 --> 00:55:41,989
time his fingerprint in in the iPhone

816
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:45,890
you have to pull it several times in

817
00:55:41,989 --> 00:55:49,549
order for all your fingerprint is

818
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:53,900
registered and then we are going to see

819
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:56,569
how the other user can pretend to be the

820
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:00,339
user with that duplicate of the

821
00:55:56,569 --> 00:56:05,719
fingerprint first time it's not working

822
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:10,670
but second time it worked so ok the user

823
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:15,380
looks the iPhone and please user with

824
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:20,180
the new fingerprint you see sit and

825
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:22,400
managed to unlock the the phone and now

826
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:24,049
he has taken off their finger print a

827
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,089
copy of the fingerprint in order to show

828
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:28,670
that this was real and that he couldn't

829
00:56:26,089 --> 00:56:32,359
access with his normal fingerprint now

830
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:40,150
we are going to show you face ID quite

831
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:42,920
briefly face ID in this case it's a

832
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:45,259
Vietnamese company that is working on

833
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:50,499
biometrics and they are the ones that

834
00:56:45,259 --> 00:56:54,049
have managed to to break this face idea

835
00:56:50,499 --> 00:56:56,118
so what Apple said when implementing

836
00:56:54,049 --> 00:56:58,400
face ID is that they have now a very

837
00:56:56,119 --> 00:57:00,709
advanced frontal camera and iPhone that

838
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:06,949
can detect 30 thousand points of your

839
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:08,690
face through infrared rays and while you

840
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:12,859
may think that with thirty thousand

841
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:15,199
points the mask that could fake your

842
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:16,940
face should be very realistic but what

843
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,519
you are going to see in this attack is

844
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:23,299
that that's not like that this is just a

845
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:26,419
minute this video the mask that had that

846
00:57:23,299 --> 00:57:29,019
this company created just name just

847
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:32,900
needs you know that to fake your

848
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:36,529
representation eyes not nose and

849
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:40,310
mouths so 30,000 points end up being

850
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:43,430
limited to these three features so they

851
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:46,549
are putting the mask in front of the

852
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:48,410
device and they must just it is

853
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:51,470
representing some of the features of a

854
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:54,770
face then this is why it's interesting I

855
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:59,870
think that at the end of the video you

856
00:57:54,770 --> 00:58:04,640
can see the mask so basic basically it's

857
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:07,759
just nice nose eyes and mouth and how

858
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:10,100
can you get that features from a person

859
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,110
well I'm sure that you've heard in any

860
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:14,150
start there are more and more public

861
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:16,550
cameras that are recording us with

862
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:19,820
facial recognition etc with high quality

863
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:23,450
pictures it is very easy to do this 3d

864
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:30,470
representation of a face before moving

865
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:36,009
to the next issue you have all let

866
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:40,359
someone use our device and for example

867
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:42,890
parents let their children use their

868
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:46,580
mobile phones and for them to watch

869
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:49,580
videos to entertain themselves or in

870
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:54,350
elderly and old people maybe comes to

871
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:56,810
you and says can you let me make a phone

872
00:58:54,350 --> 00:59:00,470
with your device I ran out of battery

873
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:04,549
do you know how can you let someone use

874
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:07,609
your mobile phone and prevent that

875
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:09,560
person to do something we are or not do

876
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:14,810
anything that you don't want him or her

877
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:18,170
to do it is like a kiosk mode it is

878
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:20,540
called kiosk mode so your device can act

879
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:22,880
as like in a kiosk mode if I want my

880
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:25,940
children to use YouTube that person will

881
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,170
only be able to use YouTube that person

882
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,090
wants to make a call that person will

883
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:31,430
only be able to make our goal well

884
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:33,170
Android half has included this many

885
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:36,950
versions ago I think it was in version

886
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:39,920
number 5 or but or personal number 6 at

887
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:42,919
least and yes is has included this in

888
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,840
the version number 13 the functionality

889
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,240
in Android is

890
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:53,750
fixing screen do you know that

891
00:59:47,240 --> 01:00:02,500
functionality so in adjustments you move

892
00:59:53,750 --> 01:00:05,780
to the security or area ok security

893
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:15,080
fixing screen as you can see here the

894
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:17,330
switch is on and of course I have once I

895
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,310
stopped using that mode he's going to

896
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:22,370
ask me for my access code for example if

897
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:29,420
I have Chrome open and I want someone to

898
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:32,330
use just a navigator I have to click on

899
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:34,970
this 13 button I have to roll up the

900
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:38,470
starting button button and here in the

901
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:38,470
upper part of the menu

902
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:55,210
if I click here okay so I keep pressed

903
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,069
here I can see a menu that says fixing

904
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:59,859
the screen so if I click on fixing the

905
01:00:57,069 --> 01:01:02,710
screen I'm going to see here a menu that

906
01:00:59,859 --> 01:01:06,910
says the screen is going to be visible

907
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:08,710
until you stop fixing it so if I try to

908
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:12,000
do something else with anybody's going

909
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:17,980
back clicking and the start button

910
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:20,349
I'm will have to press the initial

911
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:21,700
bottom I mean I cannot leave that

912
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:50,109
application order to leave that

913
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:53,828
application I have to click here okay

914
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:57,130
now when I pressed here I have to

915
01:01:53,829 --> 01:02:00,279
introduce again the password in order to

916
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:03,339
unlock the device is number 13 has

917
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:05,500
included this in a kind of weird way

918
01:02:03,339 --> 01:02:10,058
because it is part of a of an

919
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:12,549
accessibility functions and well it is

920
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:19,480
called guided access here so guided

921
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:21,819
access is the one that that allows you

922
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:24,279
to control the devices or that the

923
01:02:21,819 --> 01:02:27,038
applications of the device that can be

924
01:02:24,279 --> 01:02:28,779
used by someone else so if we open here

925
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:39,240
the Navigator and we click here three

926
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:39,240
times if we sorry

927
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:59,510
okay I didn't activate it please okay so

928
01:02:53,599 --> 01:03:08,240
here I can we can set a different code

929
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:09,740
or we can set and touch ID I mean it if

930
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,040
you can't you shouldn't use the same

931
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:17,689
password but here if I click three if I

932
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:21,829
press three times the initial button my

933
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:24,230
screen is fixed and I cannot do anything

934
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:26,690
else I'm going to stay here in this fre

935
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:30,230
application and then you click you press

936
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:31,849
three times again and I'm going to be

937
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:34,359
requested their coast that I've

938
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:37,040
introduced and now I can use my device

939
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:39,859
and there is also a restriction function

940
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,869
I don't know if you've heard of it this

941
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:47,200
option is also very interesting because

942
01:03:41,869 --> 01:03:49,430
it allows you to block the type of

943
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:52,879
adjustments available to set up their

944
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:54,669
device and I don't know why Apple huh is

945
01:03:52,880 --> 01:04:00,140
not talking too much about these

946
01:03:54,670 --> 01:04:03,650
features it's included in the timing you

947
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:06,319
use Apple application using time

948
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:09,470
application that lets you know how much

949
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:10,970
time you are spending on in front of the

950
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:13,939
screen how much time you're using on

951
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:17,720
social media they include these

952
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:20,990
especially for parental control so if

953
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:23,598
your child has a device you can say okay

954
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:25,399
you cannot be using social media more

955
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,680
than one hour and within this

956
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:33,050
functionality they included that

957
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:36,859
restriction section so if we activate

958
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:40,760
that switch we can configure eight the

959
01:04:36,859 --> 01:04:43,520
things that you want to have active in

960
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:46,940
there many of adjustments if I don't

961
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:49,910
want to permit code changes I'm not

962
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:52,160
going to be able to have that option

963
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:56,390
with it they are judgment

964
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:59,649
section we recommend not to allow this

965
01:04:56,390 --> 01:05:06,740
type of changes because this is like

966
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:10,010
double authentication process if I need

967
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:16,129
will need to put a second Kony code in

968
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:18,380
order to change my account number or my

969
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:21,190
account is name so that's the idea there

970
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,190
are many options

971
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:36,910
sorry want to show this very quickly so

972
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:44,119
if I access my many here so if I try to

973
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:46,819
access my settings menu this doesn't

974
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:48,980
appear anymore because I've disabled the

975
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:52,609
option of changing the code through the

976
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:57,890
settings so if someone tells my device

977
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:59,348
and has my access code I'm sure that he

978
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:02,390
this person is going to be able to

979
01:05:59,349 --> 01:06:03,410
change the fingerprint or things like

980
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:07,009
that because it's not going to be

981
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:08,390
available in the settings menu and we

982
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:11,289
think that this is very interesting but

983
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:15,710
Apple has not it's not spreading that

984
01:06:11,289 --> 01:06:18,079
option a lot so for families that are

985
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:20,210
watching the presentation via various

986
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:23,559
streaming we would recommend parents to

987
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:27,500
set this up well in general this

988
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:29,779
recommendation that we are thinking is

989
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:32,270
very useful because if you give your

990
01:06:29,779 --> 01:06:34,039
device to a child this person the child

991
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:38,890
is not going to be able to change your

992
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:38,890
username your codes or things like that

993
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:45,740
and something else I wanted to mention

994
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:47,450
well we didn't want to focus just on the

995
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:49,490
login screen but it is very important

996
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:51,230
for you to control that your

997
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:54,020
notifications are not active in the

998
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:57,520
login screen not just because of privacy

999
01:06:54,020 --> 01:07:00,559
issues it's very common to see people

1000
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:03,410
having notifications activated in the in

1001
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,240
the screen and it is very easy for

1002
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,759
anyone to see the messages that you are

1003
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:10,080
receiving

1004
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:12,060
so we sites privacy there are many other

1005
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:14,940
things that are important we managed to

1006
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:20,940
unlock a device that was protected with

1007
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:23,460
an MDM a management company management

1008
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:25,470
system which was very interesting and we

1009
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:29,869
got to unlock it because they had these

1010
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:35,790
notifications active enabled in the lock

1011
01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:37,950
screen and also you could see the Wi-Fi

1012
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:40,470
networks that were open without

1013
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:49,100
unlocking the screen so with that

1014
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:52,470
information we could connect to

1015
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:55,589
different to a network to our own Wi-Fi

1016
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:58,350
network with a locked device and we

1017
01:07:55,590 --> 01:08:01,320
could start launching attacks so even

1018
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:04,259
though the device was locked from the

1019
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:08,460
point of view of internal settings just

1020
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:14,760
by letting this active content opening

1021
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:22,350
the locked screen was enough to to let

1022
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:25,259
us attack that leave that device well

1023
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:29,370
this so this also quite frequent when

1024
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:32,509
someone wants to pay something and you

1025
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:36,689
can see the code that that person is

1026
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:40,830
introducing but well what we wanted you

1027
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:43,200
to explain to you is the logics of

1028
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:46,380
behind our hacker they are going to

1029
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:48,870
observe and they are going to act with

1030
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:51,839
the information that they may obtain and

1031
01:08:48,870 --> 01:08:54,599
hackers and are investigating on new

1032
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:56,609
technologies all the time they don't

1033
01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:00,089
even sleep they don't have time to sleep

1034
01:08:56,609 --> 01:09:02,009
and how can you protect against this

1035
01:09:00,089 --> 01:09:04,350
type of attack the fact of somebody

1036
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:06,600
watching you there's a traditional

1037
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:09,870
option which works very well besides

1038
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:14,640
trying to covering the screen is doing

1039
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:17,910
that just introducing your code with

1040
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:20,390
your head and your hands inside jumper

1041
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:20,389
like this

1042
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:36,359
no I don't poke em so what what do you

1043
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:41,009
think is safer pin a pattern or a

1044
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:43,740
password pin is just four digits well if

1045
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:48,690
it 6 is 1 million an alphanumeric

1046
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:53,309
pattern with capital letters and numbers

1047
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:55,200
etc implies 2 181 billion options and

1048
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:59,340
regarding patterns there are different

1049
01:09:55,200 --> 01:10:05,360
combinations to so a pattern with six

1050
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:10,950
point six dots is stronger than 40t

1051
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:16,769
password so 10,000 versus 26,000 we

1052
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:18,840
would be comparing these technologies in

1053
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:20,580
that state and regarding passwords well

1054
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:24,240
we've said enough what do you think

1055
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:27,360
about these well do you want to find out

1056
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:29,160
other methods through which we can

1057
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,769
obtain a password are you interested

1058
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:35,639
about passwords and codes or should we

1059
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:38,070
change the topic I think is something

1060
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:42,150
that we are all using you know on daily

1061
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:46,259
basis and it may be interesting so okay

1062
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:48,389
you have to try to find out how this was

1063
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:51,450
obtained we will give you later the

1064
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:53,760
reference of this video how was the code

1065
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:59,220
of this victim obtained I'm going to

1066
01:10:53,760 --> 01:11:01,230
show you okay so this is the attacker

1067
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:04,410
that's going to try to obtain the code

1068
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:06,299
of our victim well we don't we cannot

1069
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:08,820
listen to what he's saying but he saying

1070
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:11,280
okay I'm going to go inside this story

1071
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:14,130
I'm going to buy a product and there may

1072
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:16,679
be another user which is going to be my

1073
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:18,240
victim and that will be paying with a

1074
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:21,720
credit card I'm going to try to obtain

1075
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:25,110
their their pin code so this is the

1076
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:27,600
victim the girl that's fine that's pain

1077
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:29,540
with a credit card and take a look

1078
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,429
because he is going to launch the attack

1079
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:35,610
try to see how he obtained

1080
01:11:32,429 --> 01:11:38,850
now he already has the pin code of the

1081
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:41,120
victim what did he do okay let's stop

1082
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:41,120
here

1083
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:49,940
so he's recording with with his camera

1084
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:52,169
but the victim is not already there

1085
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:55,219
she's not there anymore I mean she was

1086
01:11:52,170 --> 01:12:00,800
not recording when the victim was

1087
01:11:55,219 --> 01:12:00,800
clicking was introducing the pin code Oh

1088
01:12:03,409 --> 01:12:17,730
No and if they say in principio

1089
01:12:05,699 --> 01:12:19,620
normalmente of course it is Peyman what

1090
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:24,120
would happen with technology if I could

1091
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:29,390
read the texts from the previous user

1092
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:34,860
now of course not any other ideas heat

1093
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:39,600
he has a phone with a camera that is

1094
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:43,679
recording the pin pad it is a thermal

1095
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:47,940
camera that I can adapt to the iPhone

1096
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:51,690
I think it's $200 or something like that

1097
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:53,730
it is a thermal camera so it detects

1098
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:56,570
temperatures you know if somebody has

1099
01:12:53,730 --> 01:13:01,709
been sitting on the couch

1100
01:12:56,570 --> 01:13:06,139
obviously temperature is going to

1101
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:10,949
dissipate through times so if the person

1102
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:13,100
stands the temperature is there about 15

1103
01:13:10,949 --> 01:13:16,469
minutes later it is completely

1104
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:18,719
dissipated and that that happens on

1105
01:13:16,469 --> 01:13:24,020
several surfaces depending on the

1106
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:30,630
material so what happens on pink pad

1107
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:34,260
especially those in plastic my camera

1108
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:40,020
detected so what is the order of the

1109
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:43,030
keys the last one is the one is the five

1110
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:46,239
is key number five

1111
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:48,639
you have an advantage over the buttons

1112
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:51,178
on the door right because you see the

1113
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:54,849
thermal the temperature of the last

1114
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:59,829
digit entered so depending on the

1115
01:13:54,849 --> 01:14:03,119
service metal keyboard dissipates faster

1116
01:13:59,829 --> 01:14:12,308
the heat how can you protect yourself

1117
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:15,369
from these technique okay you could wear

1118
01:14:12,309 --> 01:14:19,170
gloves but if what if it's summer I mean

1119
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:21,848
you need gloves that did not convey heat

1120
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:27,340
that's good you're already thinking as a

1121
01:14:21,849 --> 01:14:29,380
hacker how can I prevent the key from

1122
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:34,000
getting my heat because I'm not going to

1123
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:42,909
wear any gloves in summer exactly I

1124
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:48,159
could okay

1125
01:14:42,909 --> 01:14:50,558
yes because they did not convey heat so

1126
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:54,820
me more like a hero tomaten nobody says

1127
01:14:50,559 --> 01:14:58,840
a key maybe they kill you but that's an

1128
01:14:54,820 --> 01:15:02,579
option I wait longer for the heat to

1129
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:05,469
dissipate but I could do the opposite I

1130
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:08,469
could generate more heat to generate

1131
01:15:05,469 --> 01:15:08,920
noise so when I'm going to pay with my

1132
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:14,289
card

1133
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:17,500
I touched all the keys I press only four

1134
01:15:14,289 --> 01:15:19,989
but I touched the other kids in order to

1135
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:24,190
generate noise yes sometimes people

1136
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:33,098
looked him with weird faces but he

1137
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:40,839
hasn't been stolen but that's the idea

1138
01:15:33,099 --> 01:15:42,820
to thinking out of the box we want you

1139
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:46,900
to leave this room with a different

1140
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:49,239
mindset probably some of these you had

1141
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:53,489
never thought of the things we have

1142
01:15:49,239 --> 01:15:53,489
mentioned here because

1143
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:59,150
you didn't think out of the box

1144
01:15:56,230 --> 01:16:02,120
regarding some objects what else could I

1145
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:08,150
do with this so the mindset of a hacker

1146
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:11,630
is I know this device is for this so if

1147
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:15,920
I get to know the device I will know

1148
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:19,670
better than anyone how to use it maybe

1149
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:23,590
we can send homework or maybe we can do

1150
01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:26,720
a small exercise here what do you think

1151
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:29,390
it's going to be me complicated because

1152
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:34,100
you are sitting very far away from each

1153
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:36,110
other ok so your device is locked you

1154
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:39,740
have an access code

1155
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:42,290
what can a third party do if they have

1156
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:45,590
physical access to your device even if

1157
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:50,300
it's for just few seconds so it is your

1158
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:53,570
turn if you came with people you know

1159
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:57,350
because I wouldn't lend my mobile phone

1160
01:16:53,570 --> 01:17:01,070
to anyone here but please lend your

1161
01:16:57,350 --> 01:17:05,960
phone to the person next to me next to

1162
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:11,120
you you can rotate the phone if you are

1163
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:13,160
three people so look at this the lock

1164
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:21,920
screen of the user that can be

1165
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:26,210
interesting and if you came on your own

1166
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:30,320
you can do a self criticism camera this

1167
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:30,830
is quite interesting and this pisses me

1168
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:36,219
off

1169
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:36,220
we have been working with iOS and ears

1170
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:45,460
Google didn't delete this function we

1171
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:49,700
are on 20/20 please is it that difficult

1172
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:53,810
to go to settings of her and have an

1173
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:57,080
option so that I can decide if I can use

1174
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:59,840
the camera without the block code what

1175
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:06,950
could we do with the camera you need to

1176
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:11,480
start thinking these idea

1177
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:16,420
is used by audit professionals in order

1178
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:20,240
to show companies the risk they have

1179
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:23,240
according to some vulnerabilities so you

1180
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:26,360
need to think in a malicious way is it

1181
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:29,450
not to do it illegal something illegal

1182
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:32,240
because we are doing it with the

1183
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:35,360
permission of the company but is easy to

1184
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:42,139
show double morality so what could we do

1185
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:47,030
with that camera can I access tip X 16

1186
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:53,510
pictures actually you can't tell me tell

1187
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:55,969
me on what it depends poly the Almaty

1188
01:18:53,510 --> 01:19:01,240
McCord if you seem achievable okay

1189
01:18:55,970 --> 01:19:06,680
let me let me correct me if I'm wrong

1190
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:09,500
what happens today is that if you if I

1191
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:12,350
access your device I cannot access your

1192
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:14,840
previous pictures however if I start

1193
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:17,990
taking pictures I can see them but only

1194
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:19,820
those that I took at that moment it is

1195
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:22,580
true that with so many versions of

1196
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:25,519
Android and iOS you can respect anything

1197
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:28,220
so okay you cannot access what already

1198
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:37,970
exists but then I can do something right

1199
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:41,150
I can scan a code a QR code because

1200
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:45,070
cameras connect directly to a malicious

1201
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:50,089
Wi-Fi network for example they could

1202
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:53,150
scan QR codes with embedded links that

1203
01:19:50,090 --> 01:20:03,110
lead you to malicious links something

1204
01:19:53,150 --> 01:20:06,740
easier even if it's not QR codes that

1205
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:10,940
would depend if I take a picture do I

1206
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:14,120
have any function which enables me to

1207
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:18,019
send it through whatsapp telegram SMS

1208
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:19,620
any messaging service Dropbox cloud

1209
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:24,780
services

1210
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:28,740
usually the sharing option can be you

1211
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:32,700
need the access code before completing

1212
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:36,840
the hand action but yes the option of

1213
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:40,800
sharing is available at that point

1214
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:47,580
something hackers do not like if you're

1215
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:52,650
doing things with a certain style at the

1216
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:55,190
camera level I mean I love services what

1217
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:55,190
could we do

1218
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:07,140
of course a video I can record up to the

1219
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:10,260
memory is completely full and then we'll

1220
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:13,500
see what happens but let's think I know

1221
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:17,160
that an executive manager of a company

1222
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:27,990
is going to have a phone call at 12 p.m.

1223
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:31,260
and I managed to have his phone his

1224
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:34,740
phone his memory phone fool then maybe

1225
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:37,830
the phone will reset and restart and

1226
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:41,250
then he won't get that call what happens

1227
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:45,360
if I take a picture of an employer I

1228
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:48,540
take a picture of confidential

1229
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:51,509
information and then I say to my

1230
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:55,080
executive managers who I think this

1231
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:58,200
person took a picture in his device then

1232
01:21:55,080 --> 01:22:01,590
they carry out a forensic analysis and

1233
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:05,519
they find this confidential information

1234
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:10,500
pictures right those are light threats

1235
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:18,240
which are not what else have you noticed

1236
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:21,000
in your locked screen all

1237
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:23,790
functionalities I guess you're talking

1238
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:29,390
about an Android I guess yeah by default

1239
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:33,160
iOS and Android have a control center

1240
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:37,880
activated on the lock screen

1241
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:42,580
androids name is first settings menu

1242
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:46,460
so from this lock screen well kill

1243
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:49,910
anyone that has access to this just

1244
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:56,620
swiping down you can have access to

1245
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:59,870
activate Wi-Fi data Bluetooth play mode

1246
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:05,830
flight mode so what are the risks of

1247
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:09,500
that have you ever lost the mobile phone

1248
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:12,410
and you had to use the remote

1249
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:15,489
localization services what would happen

1250
01:23:12,410 --> 01:23:18,380
if they could deactivate that

1251
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:21,200
localization option you couldn't find it

1252
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:27,340
so you have to personalize you have to

1253
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:30,739
customize you have to customize your

1254
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:34,880
your phone your settings in order not to

1255
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:37,459
be able to activate those options take

1256
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,290
into account that your mobile device is

1257
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:41,719
more important than any other thing

1258
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:45,230
because everything is inside you need to

1259
01:23:41,719 --> 01:23:48,010
be sure you are protected in iOS the

1260
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:48,009
same happens

1261
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:57,799
Saros by default you have all the

1262
01:23:53,120 --> 01:24:01,540
options in iOS 13 if you press for a

1263
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:05,120
long time you can handle F drop

1264
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:07,969
Bluetooth and so on so do you know how

1265
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:12,430
to set it up in order to avoid this have

1266
01:24:07,969 --> 01:24:12,430
you ever played with that okay tell us

1267
01:24:24,979 --> 01:24:33,329
typical meant in Android typically in

1268
01:24:30,329 --> 01:24:35,369
Android you had to activate development

1269
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:38,148
options and it was more complicated but

1270
01:24:35,369 --> 01:24:45,089
in the last versions it is as easy as

1271
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:51,679
fresh this and that's all this addition

1272
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:58,369
button but as Monica says I can remove

1273
01:24:51,679 --> 01:25:01,889
some icons as we were saying before I

1274
01:24:58,369 --> 01:25:04,679
think it was Android seven and eight

1275
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:07,050
when we started to customize this

1276
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:13,229
I think the option was available but you

1277
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:15,659
had to obey to enable the other options

1278
01:25:13,229 --> 01:25:18,079
which were not available for the normal

1279
01:25:15,659 --> 01:25:22,888
user and the thing happens with iers

1280
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:25,320
years so that I enabled it Toad's ID

1281
01:25:22,889 --> 01:25:29,669
code you enter the code and it was

1282
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:33,419
protected okay you go down and then what

1283
01:25:29,669 --> 01:25:37,769
do we recommend to disable this control

1284
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:41,729
center and the Notification Center so

1285
01:25:37,769 --> 01:25:43,860
that any no sensitive information can be

1286
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:47,059
on the screen there is also another

1287
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:52,648
option from the control center which

1288
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:55,499
let's look for it enables you to

1289
01:25:52,649 --> 01:25:58,649
customize buttons the problem is that

1290
01:25:55,499 --> 01:26:01,110
some of them cannot be withdrawn even if

1291
01:25:58,649 --> 01:26:06,209
you want to because they are there by

1292
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:10,199
default so we recommend to unblock to

1293
01:26:06,209 --> 01:26:15,300
remove the control center especially for

1294
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:21,478
those who have biometrics when there was

1295
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:25,349
no biometrics they way of not entering a

1296
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:27,959
super secure password and wasting time I

1297
01:26:25,349 --> 01:26:32,550
didn't want to do that I wanted to act

1298
01:26:27,959 --> 01:26:34,290
in a very fast way but biometrics is

1299
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:40,050
there to make thing

1300
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:42,240
faster pregunta al respect oh no vamos

1301
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:44,640
ninos saltando por un poco tiempo no y

1302
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:46,380
cosas que queremos cantar vamos Iravan

1303
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:48,240
stand ole algunas cosas estos todo lo

1304
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:53,010
que hemos visto ok let's keep on

1305
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:57,630
advancing that we saw something such as

1306
01:26:53,010 --> 01:27:01,260
camera the control center the disabling

1307
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:04,110
biometrics so now as an exercise as

1308
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:08,400
homework protect yourselves

1309
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:12,139
you need to devote some time in the

1310
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:16,460
settings menu in order to make your

1311
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:20,520
access more secure there are other

1312
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:25,830
vulnerabilities we don't want to keep on

1313
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:28,620
going on these directions now at the end

1314
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:40,920
we will give you some links do you know

1315
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:41,280
what this is mm women festivity well as

1316
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,190
linear

1317
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:49,340
yes that's what they did in esta come

1318
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:54,740
from a tower which was covering the sky

1319
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:59,120
due to the thousands of cables this is

1320
01:27:54,740 --> 01:28:03,090
we cannot imagine that with wireless

1321
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:10,620
technologies can you see if you have

1322
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:14,220
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth activated if it is

1323
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:17,610
right you go to settings and then there

1324
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:20,160
is a communication or network option and

1325
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:23,190
you can access that if you want we can

1326
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:30,660
start with Bluetooth and then we move on

1327
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:35,870
to Wi-Fi how is it can you see or the

1328
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:35,870
devices tell us what do you see I

1329
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:42,240
suppose destiny is Bluetooth Avila tada

1330
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:46,980
algunos she owed us no um dia de Mestral

1331
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:51,989
idea do you have it activated

1332
01:28:46,980 --> 01:29:00,179
more enabled if you go to settings what

1333
01:28:51,989 --> 01:29:03,089
happened Harvey has an mi5 and there is

1334
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:06,030
another one on the room so I can see

1335
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:18,360
your device's geekiness cubby

1336
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:24,809
who is hiring with an USB device from

1337
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:28,500
line notes device is this red device USB

1338
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:34,500
stick that costs around 30 euros with

1339
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:37,110
external antennas in this case it's red

1340
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:39,480
but if it were black you wouldn't have

1341
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:43,410
even notice it so you can't scan

1342
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:46,019
Bluetooth when devices are available are

1343
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:53,120
invisible this is quite curious because

1344
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:57,000
today only by accessing the Bluetooth

1345
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:59,460
button it starts to be visible in order

1346
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:05,070
to discover all the devices but for all

1347
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:07,650
the devices to discover your device we

1348
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:10,710
do not have much activity much religious

1349
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:16,019
activity only two devices what about

1350
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:21,390
Wi-Fi do you have Wi-Fi activated my

1351
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:25,320
question is why is Wi-Fi activated in

1352
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:28,320
your daily life okay maybe now you're

1353
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:30,889
using Wi-Fi network but what happens

1354
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:35,130
when you leave the room do you always

1355
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:37,739
remember to switch it off when leaving

1356
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:40,470
the room leaving the house live in the

1357
01:30:37,739 --> 01:30:45,530
office of course not it is quite

1358
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:45,530
difficult to always remember that while

1359
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:56,700
we were given this speech we so loud we

1360
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:58,790
guess there are people from the

1361
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:02,389
university

1362
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:07,610
or maybe caste go5 she rings a bell for

1363
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:14,600
you someone or jolanda's iPhone or has

1364
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:17,360
been here yolanda accent access some

1365
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:24,380
time and it is quite active Yolanda's

1366
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:27,440
phone is quite active movie star a7 5:18

1367
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:37,490
because maybe it's somebody's home

1368
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:41,269
network valley chord it's pink up as

1369
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:44,780
possible Wi-Fi networks beautiful there

1370
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:50,140
were some interesting ones I'm gonna

1371
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:53,690
show you on my web or my web external

1372
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:57,190
web a fool it is better not to find some

1373
01:31:53,690 --> 01:32:03,259
networks what happens with all of this

1374
01:31:57,190 --> 01:32:05,690
basically your devices Polycarp so now

1375
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:07,720
with the corporate maybe it is a

1376
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:10,700
corporate network from a company

1377
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:13,940
basically what they did was to take a

1378
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:17,630
Wi-Fi interface with an antenna and an

1379
01:32:13,940 --> 01:32:20,719
adapter we connected it and we were

1380
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:25,510
scanning the traffic of your devices

1381
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:31,760
which are willing to connect to familiar

1382
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:35,390
networks this is the P VP and ppl the

1383
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:38,810
list of favorite networks which

1384
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:41,840
registers all the networks to which your

1385
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:45,170
device has been connected and that has

1386
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:49,910
many implications because an attacker

1387
01:32:45,170 --> 01:32:52,820
that wants to see where you are and I am

1388
01:32:49,910 --> 01:32:56,900
addressing again those families with

1389
01:32:52,820 --> 01:33:00,650
children they can know where that person

1390
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:03,530
is because if they are connected to

1391
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:05,599
Wi-Fi network from my school they know

1392
01:33:03,530 --> 01:33:08,690
where they are and the

1393
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:11,300
I can know if you have been in a place

1394
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:16,219
where you shouldn't have been all that

1395
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:22,330
information is being revealed by your

1396
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:30,260
device when you are not when you have

1397
01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:35,930
Wi-Fi activated how can you prevent this

1398
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:41,800
apart from deactivating the deactivating

1399
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:46,070
the Wi-Fi delete in the network right

1400
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:51,020
here we had cyber come 2019 when

1401
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:58,340
tomorrow is over I can delete it and you

1402
01:33:51,020 --> 01:34:00,620
should delete it I don't want to delete

1403
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:04,720
it all the time right because I'm going

1404
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:11,750
there every day so as Monica was saying

1405
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:15,590
I remember a case where we did testing

1406
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:23,540
we localized an executive manager in

1407
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:27,410
Poland it was due to another unique

1408
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:31,280
network name which was localized in a

1409
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:38,500
specific point of the earth my teammate

1410
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:42,800
was here with index also new

1411
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:48,730
configuration so never said Wi-Fi as

1412
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:55,430
hidden networks because company because

1413
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:57,740
your Wi-Fi look for them and reveal

1414
01:34:55,430 --> 01:35:01,610
information the level of security of a

1415
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:03,889
hidden Wi-Fi is very very low so it's

1416
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:07,880
not worth it and try to remember to

1417
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:10,640
delete all of them all of them to which

1418
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:15,050
you do not have to connect anymore the

1419
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:16,590
risk is when an attacker creates a Wi-Fi

1420
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:25,159
network in order to

1421
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:25,159
la familia Network what happens if I

1422
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:36,750
open access point and name it m-makes

1423
01:35:33,599 --> 01:35:40,500
then you will want to connect and you

1424
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:44,940
will be attacked even if the network has

1425
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:49,710
a password in order to get the password

1426
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:52,290
if the network is open the device has

1427
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:57,349
connected and shares the same network

1428
01:35:52,290 --> 01:36:00,719
with the attacker and when that happens

1429
01:35:57,349 --> 01:36:03,300
there is a man-in-the-middle attack you

1430
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:10,199
are in the middle and you can handle the

1431
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:14,369
traffic between both the devices just a

1432
01:36:10,199 --> 01:36:18,960
Rando algunas conclusions no a muscle

1433
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:22,139
community or resume mr. la parte since

1434
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:25,099
we are running out of time and we have

1435
01:36:22,139 --> 01:36:29,040
already seen the most important points

1436
01:36:25,099 --> 01:36:32,400
let's talk about another thing we

1437
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:36,360
expected to have younger people who are

1438
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:39,629
not familiar with older devices but you

1439
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:43,199
need to be familiar with what your

1440
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:47,750
device has can you remember all those

1441
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:53,388
gadgets that we used to have like VHS

1442
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:58,409
voice recorders the most traditional GPS

1443
01:36:53,389 --> 01:37:03,599
compasses radios clocks everything

1444
01:36:58,409 --> 01:37:09,888
inside your smartphone I do not

1445
01:37:03,599 --> 01:37:09,889
understand if it is so useful to have

1446
01:37:13,429 --> 01:37:19,739
smart-aleck on la cual la finta la

1447
01:37:15,869 --> 01:37:21,780
compra is a mute ELISA I don't know if

1448
01:37:19,739 --> 01:37:24,449
it's that useful but people when doing

1449
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:26,099
the groceries use their smartphone you

1450
01:37:24,449 --> 01:37:28,230
know that you know if they have enough

1451
01:37:26,099 --> 01:37:32,010
eggs and what is this

1452
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:35,580
raspberry I am surd you have one of them

1453
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:38,810
at home but be careful because NASA was

1454
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:45,540
attacked by because they had a lost

1455
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:48,230
raspberry pee they eat they eat wasn't

1456
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:51,720
in their stock and they stole their

1457
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:55,519
credentials in June 2019 it was

1458
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:59,280
published that somebody accessed the

1459
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:04,860
laboratory of NASA but the attack

1460
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:08,519
happened from April 2018 so that person

1461
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:11,790
was there for over a year and extracted

1462
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:15,810
confidential documents of missions to

1463
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:21,060
Mars and they even accessed the Deep

1464
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:23,730
Space Network so with very high high

1465
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:29,460
confidential information about black

1466
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:32,940
holes so an institution such as NASA God

1467
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:36,480
attacked there wasn't a person named

1468
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:38,660
Jonathan James who hacked NASA and the

1469
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:46,610
Pentagon and aimed up in prison and

1470
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:52,080
there is popular cyber scammer in Spain

1471
01:38:46,610 --> 01:38:54,719
who has been a priority one for police

1472
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:59,130
for years and now he has already been

1473
01:38:54,720 --> 01:39:01,890
arrested did not end up in prison you

1474
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:06,060
can play with it you can venerate it but

1475
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:07,920
without crossing any illegal lines you

1476
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:10,739
need to do it with your own technology

1477
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:13,140
and with the permission and if there are

1478
01:39:10,739 --> 01:39:17,629
children doing the only difference

1479
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:21,840
between a normal digital criminal and

1480
01:39:17,630 --> 01:39:24,360
normal digit normal criminal is that

1481
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:27,720
probably the criminal the digital

1482
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:30,210
criminal will be able to obtain a job

1483
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:33,420
after prison that's the only difference

1484
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:36,270
both are criminals so we should get to

1485
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:38,790
know technology from the beginning we

1486
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:40,410
cannot do the ostrich approach of

1487
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:42,360
avoiding technology

1488
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:44,340
we need to get to know it but we need to

1489
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:46,250
protect also against it

1490
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:49,500
we need to consume it with

1491
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:52,590
responsibility maybe there will be some

1492
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:56,850
campaigns telling you protect your

1493
01:39:52,590 --> 01:40:02,880
devices there are some cases that

1494
01:39:56,850 --> 01:40:07,710
isolate your device from GPS 1 2 3 4 5 G

1495
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:11,400
Bluetooth Wi-Fi and there are also USB

1496
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:13,980
condoms to isolate data connection and

1497
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:18,750
only give you electricity that's

1498
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:21,559
important when using any plug to charge

1499
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:24,750
your battery but you do not know if

1500
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:31,110
behind the wall there is a computer

1501
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:33,150
getting your data in even in Asia for

1502
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:36,240
example children come already with a

1503
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:40,549
Wi-Fi network you don't need to use the

1504
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:45,050
tinfoil the idea is to learn from

1505
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:51,600
technology and as references this is

1506
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:55,160
gift for you this is a link so that in

1507
01:40:51,600 --> 01:41:00,680
which you will find more references or

1508
01:40:55,160 --> 01:41:03,809
music I am sure you all have what's up

1509
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:07,380
so you have guidelines you know the to

1510
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:10,950
protect what's up how can I verify that

1511
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:16,260
a contact is who they say they are and

1512
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:21,990
so on and that's all thank you very much

1513
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:24,720
for having come here and I hope this

1514
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:27,120
workshop has been useful for you do you

1515
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:31,310
have any question thank you thank you

1520
01:41:53,660 --> 01:42:02,180
yell our goddess but you can't III very

1521
01:41:57,560 --> 01:42:07,900
thin straight lines that cross says all

1522
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:07,900
the points will it be easier to solve it

1523
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:20,690
exactly that's the do what we wanted

1524
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:25,640
what happens if I use a very thick pen

1525
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:29,839
and with only one line I can do it yeah

1526
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:32,180
that's good keep on keep on thinking out

1527
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:35,930
of the box keeps on getting to know

1528
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:38,390
technology and if you are interested we

1529
01:42:35,930 --> 01:42:42,170
are collaborating with the hackathon

1530
01:42:38,390 --> 01:42:44,420
collaboration so we encourage you to see

1531
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:46,310
