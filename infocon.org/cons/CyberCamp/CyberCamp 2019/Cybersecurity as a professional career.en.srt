hour as we have been introduced and as

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,060
it has been said we're going to talk

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,720
about professional opportunities and

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,269
cyber security currently as they set

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,308
during the inauguration our general

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,550
manager as well as the secretary of

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,110
state cyber security is an industry

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,680
which is growing thus loads of

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:44,670
professional opportunities and today

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,940
we're going to have very important

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,730
speakers to give us a very holistic

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,890
vision of the professional opportunities

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,870
and the studies that we can undergo in

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,120
order to end up working in cyber

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,968
security we're going to have the

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:05,610
presentation here at the background slow

20
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,320
issue with the presentation but whilst

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,570
we get that sorted I'm going to

22

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,920
University of Valencia what they're

32
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,829
going to do is introduce briefly how

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,750
they see from the point of view of every

34
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,460
different institution what the

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,270
professional opportunities are

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,880
cybersecurity what studies will lead you

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,520
to a career in cybersecurity and when we

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,408
finish we'll have an open question and

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,780
answer session for those of you who

40
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,100
don't know what they should do now or

41
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,990
what they should do once they finish

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,740
this to you this can ask any questions

43
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:07,619
they have and and we have a few

44
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,109
questions if you didn't have any that

45
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,420
have

46
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,420
asked before and we can use them later

47
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,220
it looks like the presentations not

48
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,530
working right now so we're going to

49
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,380
start talking about cybersecurity which

50
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,600
is an environment which is currently

51
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:29,079
growing it's an industry that is growing

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,750
and there's a lack of experts and

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,280
professionals whilst we have everyone's

54
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,270
presentation I'm going to ask the first

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,910
question what is the future of

56
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,800
cybersecurity what does it look like why

57
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:46,890
is it so important right now

58
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,850
why cybersecurity sirki alejandro well

59
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:53,500
good morning everyone

60
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:55,180
I think for all of you who are here is

61
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,090
going to be very obvious why

62
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,530
cybersecurity is important companies

63
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:06,120
more and more consent every day towards

64
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:10,630
the risks that they facing every day and

65
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,360
because of new technologies companies

66
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:16,350
are being targeted every day and they

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,200
need mechanisms tools systems and

68
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:23,109
professionals who help them to face

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,630
these risks they also need to find

70
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:31,930
balance between the budget that goes

71
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:34,660
toward cybersecurity and to compensate

72
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:38,170
it with the risks that they might face

73
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,600
they have to assess which risks may

74
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,720
affect their branding the brand image

75
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:50,890
and their business and that is why

76
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:54,130
cybersecurity right now is one of and we

77
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,738
were going to talk about this a lot this

78
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:00,549
morning but it's one of the main niche

79
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,920
for professionals from the point of view

80
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:07,450
of academia maybe Ramon can tell us

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,850
something about education well as

82
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,420
Alejandro was saying cybersecurity is

83
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:16,690
growing continuously and from the point

84
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:19,169
of view of vocational training them

85
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,790
I'm pleased that we are surrounded with

86
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,820
and with whom we have internship

87
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,330
agreements demanding more technicians

88
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,440
especially when it comes from operations

89
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:33,550
security operations or network

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,550
operations these are positions that

91
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,310
usually engineer's do not do because

92
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,920
they usually manage at a higher level

93
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,890
different operations so there are a lot

94
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:49,690
of opportunities with the Internet of

95
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:54,789
Things victims especially in industry in

96
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,680
general companies facing new risks every

97
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,740
day because we have new possibilities

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,230
new sales channels ways of doing

99
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,150
business online so we we face new risks

100
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,790
every day is that handle we're saying so

101
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:10,229
there's there's a very high demand which

102
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:14,620
is also increasing in cyber security and

103
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:16,900
for students to train in this area is

104
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,810
very important because they have many

105
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,190
opportunities to find a job now from the

106
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,530
point of view of universities we have

107
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,400
the to many universities in Valente how

108
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:29,229
do you see the situation well from the

109
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,900
point of view of the Polytechnic

110
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:38,620
University I agree completely with what

111
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:42,659
has been said because we also have not

112
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:46,270
only to train but also to research and

113
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,640
and then obviously the opportunities

114
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:52,539
because right now there are many people

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,610
who graduated by in in different

116
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,220
universities and but are not specialized

117
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,860
in cyber security but do end up from

118
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:03,370
different degrees working in cyber

119
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,310
security so I do agree that in many

120
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,290
industries what they're asking right now

121
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:13,990
and this is not only for companies it's

122
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:16,680
it's for also higher positions when it

123
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,810
comes to innovation to research to

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,180
development to thinking about what will

125
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,910
happen with big data in a few years or

126
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,030
with the with industry with a different

127
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,830
attacks that they are facing and being

128
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,520
the target off so this is a critical

129
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:37,180
point in

130
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:41,560
many opportunities well I think some

131
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:45,580
years ago we were on the mobility decade

132
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,220
with mobile phones and communication

133
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:52,289
devices between people and this decade

134
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:55,830
is the decade of security we've got

135
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:58,360
numerous days they're going between

136
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,389
companies we have many devices that can

137
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,180
be targeted by hackers and so we have to

138
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:06,970
keep the integrity of that data and of

139
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,889
that information so we're going towards

140
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,620
a century where everything is going to

141
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:13,449
be around data about information and we

142
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,090
definitely have to protect the integrity

143
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,580
of that data and that information so if

144
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,359
I have to study again I would definitely

145
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,550
do a master's in cybersecurity

146
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:29,229
now along these lines especially when it

147
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:31,750
comes to the it work to education we

148
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,550
know that this is a very young industry

149
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,219
that there are many people who work

150
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:39,190
already in cybersecurity but who are

151
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:42,009
self-taught so I would like especially

152
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,509
from the point of view of universities

153
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,159
and education and also from the

154
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,699
professional point of view what added

155
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:52,270
value to someone bring who has trained

156
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:59,590
in cybersecurity versus someone who has

157
00:07:52,270 --> 00:08:05,669
trained themselves well I think the main

158
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:09,929
difference is that in this kind of

159
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:12,400
issues practice and experience has just

160
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,159
make a big difference because at home

161
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,620
you can watch videos you can see things

162
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,569
and but I think the way you're quiet

163
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,130
knowledge is when someone tells you

164
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,199
about the problems that they've had and

165
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:26,289
the issues that they've had to face

166
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,560
there are many online causes nowadays

167
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:31,330
but they will never give you the

168
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,990
experience that someone has if they have

169
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,929
been working for years in this area and

170
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,190
what I would add is that cybersecurity

171
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:43,900
is

172
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:47,620
very mmm multi-faceted and I think if

173
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,670
you have that kind of training you can

174
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,490
definitely do that

175
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:54,459
from home you can see many things but it

176
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,550
is precisely from universities will be

177
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:01,630
fostering multifaceted

178
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,839
the education and although there aren't

179
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,390
that many specific training programs or

180
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,750
the masses and everything I think we do

181
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:13,300
provide a very rich education that can

182
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,700
then be applied to industry and the

183
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,680
people who train with us then in high

184
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:21,970
demand for companies because companies

185
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:25,959
do look for that kind of profile and how

186
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,810
about vocational training well we think

187
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,580
that being self-taught is definitely key

188
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,939
and actually companies do tell us that

189
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,270
they prefect someone who has the will

190
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,130
and the attitude towards learning and

191
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,770
having also a professional certificate

192
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,810
but at the end of the day companies what

193
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,810
they want to know is what you can do so

194
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,459
I think it's definitely key that if

195
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,650
someone who is passionate about what

196
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,710
they do if they like cybersecurity if

197
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:56,980
they work in many different fields they

198
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,660
work at home they do they try different

199
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,200
things they have little shock at home

200
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,810
they fiddle a little bit around with

201
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,470
their ruse so what the actual definition

202
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:10,150
of geek that we've always had I don't

203
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,030
like the word eek but it's it's the

204
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,530
picture that we always get so that for

205
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,060
companies the fact that you have your

206
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,829
own blog that you can share your

207
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,510
knowledge so you come to conferences and

208
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,940
you do speeches so companies do value

209
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,250
the fact that you have formal training

210
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,290
but I think that increasingly looking

211
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,230
for people who can do a bit more than

212
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:39,430
that and how about from the professional

213
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:42,209
point of view well I understand what the

214
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:45,899
people from universities have

215
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:48,508
set I think formal training the way we

216
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,939
know it nowadays both from public and

217
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:55,370
private institutions is very important

218
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:57,719
in order to have a certain skills that

219
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:01,680
will allow you to develop your

220
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:04,680
profession later on it is also true than

221
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,729
nowadays we have multiple channels where

222
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,550
we can train ourselves be it with open

223
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,079
massive open and courses you've got

224
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,998
YouTube I don't think there's a great

225
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:17,660
source of knowledge but I'm sure that

226
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:19,769
there will be people who know how to

227
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,719
pass on that knowledge and you can

228
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:25,769
actually internalize some of their

229
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:28,139
knowledge but I think there are many

230
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:29,639
many different ways of complementing

231
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,160
your formal training I think it's

232
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,499
actually key and I think we will all

233
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,829
agree the nowadays no one who has had

234
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:39,569
has just obtained their degree can stop

235
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:41,839
learning because this is a changing

236
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:43,979
market especially cybersecurity

237
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,100
everything is changing the attacks

238
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,559
changing the fields are changing you

239
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,399
have to be doing continuous professional

240
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:55,860
development CPD all the time companies

241
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,670
do look for someone who is curious who

242
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:03,259
want to keep training who wants to keep

243
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:05,790
learning and that is very important

244
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:09,120
specialization is key especially for

245
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:14,040
certain positions especially technical

246
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:19,129
positions but you have to have a very

247
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:23,670
broad vision of business of what risks

248
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:27,589
businesses face and all in all what can

249
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:29,610
help you have an advantage in the

250
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:33,959
professional market especially for

251
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:36,120
people who were looking for jobs which

252
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:38,128
in this case will be saying well it's

253
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,910
not easy but easier than in other

254
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:43,529
industries so just to summarize what

255
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,040
we've been saying we could say that

256
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,720
whilst it is true that training both

257
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,629
University and vocational training gives

258
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,389
us some fundamental some basis and some

259
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:54,830
knowledge it is in high demand also a

260
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:57,730
profit

261
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:02,630
someone who goes a bit further who wants

262
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:05,209
to try new things so we are looking for

263
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,670
a bit of everything boys and girls so

264
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:09,349
we're looking for people who do formal

265
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,390
training but also people who go a bit

266
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,640
further and want to make a difference

267
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:16,760
compared to the other people who are

268
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,310
applying for a job well now that we have

269
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,100
the presentation I'm going to let

270
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:32,268
Alejandra tell us a little bit what how

271
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:33,279
they see it from his institution good

272
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,570
morning everyone

273
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,829
I've already said good morning because

274
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,200
we've been talking a bit but I would

275
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:46,939
like to take this opportunity to think

276
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,170
in theory for organizing this event also

277
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,149
because they've decided to do it in

278
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:53,180
Valencia although it looks like we are

279
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:54,589
becoming a bit trendy in the last few

280
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,339
months and actually I've been here for

281
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:59,930
the third time today in in two weeks

282
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:01,880
also thank you to all those who are

283
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:07,010
showing my round to the round table with

284
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:08,689
me today and without further ado because

285
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:12,470
we've changed a little bit the pace of

286
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:19,070
the conference today I wanted to show

287
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:21,470
you a little bit Dyanne news headings or

288
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:25,490
media headings both from digital and

289
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:28,040
paper media and general and special

290
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,649
media and this gives us a very clear

291
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,319
vision of what that situation looks like

292
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:36,500
nowadays when it comes to employment in

293
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:41,029
the cybersecurity industry as you can

294
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:44,209
see very clearly we are expecting this

295
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:47,930
industry to grow dramatically that

296
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:49,939
employment will hence increase that it

297
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:56,839
is very difficult to find talent

298
00:14:49,940 --> 00:15:00,410
nowadays that is a highly profitable

299
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,300
niche as I was saying and far a few more

300
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:06,140
data

301
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:09,849
concerning the industry as we can see

302
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:14,390
here as well there's a big gender gap

303
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:18,380
because a few women who work in

304
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:21,590
cybersecurity actually well in in

305
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:24,350
general there's very few women who work

306
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:28,070
in computing the night ear in general so

307
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:30,860
cybercrime is profitable and is still

308
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:35,690
profitable so we're going to be

309
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:37,010
suffering attacks in general in

310
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,590
companies and most companies are

311
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,550
understanding that the area's the

312
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:43,460
cybersecurity

313
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,959
areas too small they need more

314
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:49,450
professionals but at the same time they

315
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,450
cannot feel and fulfill all their needs

316
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:57,280
they also intend to increase their

317
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,280
spending on this over the coming years

318
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:04,010
this perception that we have based on

319
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:08,660
some articles and headlines in

320
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:12,439
newspapers it's also backed up by other

321
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:18,140
day turned reports from international

322
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:20,570
sources such as I sac and they have the

323
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:24,590
different areas of knowledge regarding

324
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:28,850
how cyber security is evolving and this

325
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:31,790
is also relevant the vacancies are not

326
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,620
being covered and the candidates

327
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,560
themselves don't believe that they have

328
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:42,290
sufficient expertise in order to be able

329
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:45,380
to opt for those positions knowledge of

330
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,770
the profession has been identified as a

331
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:52,370
gap gap of knowledge amongst the

332
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:54,620
candidates we were mentioning that you

333
00:16:52,370 --> 00:17:05,079
need to have a good white knowledge

334
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:08,300
broad knowledge of the business all

335
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:11,179
candidates according to businesses are

336
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,639
not prepared to face the challenges and

337
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:18,480
there is

338
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:24,179
in the business and also another point

339
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:30,000
which i think is very interesting and

340
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:34,070
I'd like to highlight this today almost

341
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,450
80% of men of men it's understood that

342
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:40,549
men and women have the same

343
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:45,770
opportunities in businesses but in fact

344
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:45,770
49% of women only share that opinion

345
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:56,520
this can be resolved through diversity

346
00:17:50,970 --> 00:18:01,290
programs in businesses what do we do in

347
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:05,010
order to contribute to resolving this in

348
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:08,520
Tallinn to try and fit the correct

349
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:20,040
profiles with the the available offers

350
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:22,260
and the the needs we are public entity

351
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:29,220
and we represent a number of

352
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:32,970
professionals in the field we do is

353
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:36,059
almost a outside of working hours and we

354
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,650
try to collaborate with universities we

355
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:41,040
collaborate with the two universities in

356
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:44,940
Berlin in Valencia particularly in the

357
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:57,210
forest stem project which is promoted by

358
00:18:44,940 --> 00:19:04,320
the College of the scientists and this

359
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:08,370
is basically a project 30 aims to raise

360
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,340
awareness about stem and who promotes

361
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:18,270
the vocation of women within the field

362
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:20,480
of technology also participate in a

363
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,790
competition which is stem for teens

364
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,030
and it's for fourth and fifth year

365
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:28,220
secondary education students and it's

366
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,080
trying to get them closer to the world

367
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:36,860
of technology and bring young people

368
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:39,500
closer to projects that I'm talking

369
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:44,120
about new projects they haven't been

370
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:46,520
running for long the Employment

371
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,840
Authority for example we received

372
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:54,230
information to think a little bit more

373
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,330
about the competencies that are

374
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:59,450
currently existing and we are working on

375
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:02,210
that with them we're trying to work out

376
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:07,130
a better profile of the people who'll be

377
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:09,530
working today and tomorrow and I can

378
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,520
tell you that we have made a suggestion

379
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:17,590
that cybersecurity should be covered

380
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:20,690
across the board in all areas of

381
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:25,510
Education and this was delivered this

382
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:29,650
report was delivered last we have the

383
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:34,070
employment authority service so that

384
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:36,440
offers can be published the office

385
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:43,909
that's been provided by universities and

386
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:48,860
companies that is our employment service

387
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:53,110
that we have been running we have issued

388
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:57,939
a number of opportunities this year and

389
00:20:53,110 --> 00:21:00,649
with a volume of 644 professional

390
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:05,960
opportunities and with a success rate of

391
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:12,290
around 10 percent we tried to give ad

392
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:16,540
hoc training courses these two proposals

393
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,540
for training for the coming months

394
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:24,790
related to different areas of technology

395
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,360
and another one regarding cyber security

396
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:31,770
it's called experts in cyber security

397
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:34,919
and this will be done over a number

398
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:37,200
for events and so that people can get

399
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:41,300
the sufficient training under to move

400
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,490
and to manage the world of cybersecurity

401
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:50,100
we have some activities going on in the

402
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:53,520
professional world we have public and

403
00:21:50,100 --> 00:22:00,300
private services that are based on

404
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:04,440
demand we can carry out audits and this

405
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:10,100
is we cover issues that are currently

406
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:16,560
very on invoke such as what's up and

407
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:18,870
taking people's identity of course we

408
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:29,060
have to have ethics within our field and

409
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:33,030
this is also something that we cover the

410
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,830
definition of the the professionals in

411
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,670
the field we are working that on that

412
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:41,760
air with a European participation and

413
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:46,250
national committees to divine define the

414
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,250
roles in IT for professionals

415
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:53,580
what is the market actually looking for

416
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:57,960
in our opinion the market is looking for

417
00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:00,000
all kinds of profiles more some to do

418
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,790
with more with cyber security more to do

419
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,470
with networks and systems you need

420
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:13,620
knowledge of methodology and good

421
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:18,140
practices professional vocational

422
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,139
training or as also has an added value

423
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,720
and there is also a little bit of

424
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,450
resistance in terms of the knowledge of

425
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:32,570
language we need to go beyond just

426
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:34,830
knowing Spanish you have a bit of

427
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,620
information something that you can turn

428
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,540
to which I think is very interesting

429
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:45,530
it's information that was released

430
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:48,149
weeks ago and its analysis of the

431
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:55,320
digital and not digital professional

432
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:58,800
opportunities linked to the professional

433
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:02,129
opportunities it's divided up by

434
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,899
provinces so depending on where you are

435
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,460
from you can look at the opportunities

436
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,330
that you have and the knowledge that you

437
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:15,360
will need in order to be able to opt for

438
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:17,460
those opportunities this information has

439
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,100
been taken from various sources from

440
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:25,950
different companies that publish their

441
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:31,439
offers including input jobs I think it's

442
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:33,480
worth spending a few minutes there is

443
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,510
one section that says expert in cyber

444
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:39,030
security and it indicates the

445
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:41,780
requirements in order to opt for that

446
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,780
role

447
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:54,300
so in terms of the opportunities in the

448
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:58,649
professional world what can we use our

449
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:03,330
knowledge for there are different roles

450
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:10,410
and professional functions we can manage

451
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:13,639
security within businesses we can also

452
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:22,950
work in sales and pre-sales audits

453
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:26,490
consultancy developing software and

454
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:30,450
there's also a systems technicians

455
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:35,010
opportunities and this is related with

456
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:37,170
privacy gen managing data and privacy

457
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:43,650
and this is across all sectors of

458
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:46,350
Industry all companies need to have

459
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:50,040
people who are looking after their area

460
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:52,830
cybersecurity you can work in a company

461
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,790
you work as a freelance self-employed

462
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,409
person or based on projects there are

463
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:02,090
more and more people who are

464
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:02,090

466
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,570

00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:49,139
I'd like to talk a little bit about the

490

profit vocational training the current

491
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:55,950
status of vocational training training

is currently grouped in two different

493
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:03,210
families and we're in telecommunications

494
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:05,250

training and there are two modules that

499
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:22,440
are verticals we say the rest are

500
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:25,169
transversal there are techniques of how

501
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,140
to protect applications and so on there

502
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,680
are nice they're only two modules that

503
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:36,480
are called

504
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:39,690
computer security these modules just

505
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,630
cover two terms so there's a very little

506
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:48,690
time there's only year five hours of

507
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:51,510
training a week they reach around a

508
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:56,820
hundred hundred and ten hours and they

509
00:28:51,510 --> 00:29:00,499
give a general overview of what of these

510
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:03,210
subjects I'll give you a general idea

511
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:05,759
but we are not able to get into these

512
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:12,869
skills and competencies that companies

513
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:15,869
are actually looking for so you have the

514
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:18,869
content of the mid-level and super level

515
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:23,580
vocational training courses and in the

516
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:25,590
mid-level would be a technician more

517
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:29,759
into towards small and medium sized

518
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:31,709
companies and the superior level is a

519
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:35,070
technician who has the mid-level

520
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,950
training but also has little extra and

521
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:43,369
can work in perhaps larger companies

522
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:43,369
larger corporations in s Sox and NOx

523
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,899
[Music]

524
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:51,240
linphea we have a the entity for

525
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:55,340
response to emergencies and we had a

526
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,340
speech about that from Laura this

527
00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:03,240
perhaps more advanced areas in the

528
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:07,919
superior level training Alejandro said

529
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:11,850
in cybersecurity we also have some data

530
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,830
here to to share I won't cover it in

531
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,320
detail because Alejandro already

532
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:19,019
mentioned this but from our point of

533
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,580
view and our experience what I can tell

534
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:26,039
you is that companies are looking for

535
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,960
different profiles and they have up to

536
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:34,289
six months of positions that not being

537
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:36,869
covered so we can say there is maybe a

538
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:40,408
niche where somebody who has vocational

539
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:42,749
training can cover people who have a

540
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:46,139
higher level training or knowledge of

541
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:48,929
autism so on can't cover and these

542
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:50,699
positions can be complementary now

543
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:54,509
they're looking for many people with

544
00:30:50,700 --> 00:31:01,799
vocational training level two level one

545
00:30:54,509 --> 00:31:08,350
and two for operations and so on okay so

546
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:09,719
slappy CV

547
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:13,619
[Music]

548
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:15,449
and whatever they what are they

549
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:18,499
suggesting as you listen come a little

550
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:21,419
bit late but since June of this year

551
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:27,419
there is a specialist course in

552
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:30,209
cybersecurity for IT companies and this

553
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:33,059
is part of our family and there is

554
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:36,109
another field that's also growing and

555
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:41,849
cybersecurity in industrial environments

556
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:44,668
these work in parallel so in order to be

557
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:46,619
able to walk work in industrial sectors

558
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:51,499
but I'm going to be talking this morning

559
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:51,499
about the one that we are dealing with

560
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:59,549
currently the course is only in draft

561
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:00,958
version so hopefully for the next school

562
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:05,339
year we'll be able to put it into

563
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:07,169
practice so this would be provided by

564
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:13,678
centers that provide for vacation or

565
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:16,499
training this is for people who have

566
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:20,959
vocational training qualifications on

567
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:27,119
the superior level in app development

568
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:29,429
web development and it's for them in

569
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:36,539
order to get training so that gets more

570
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:39,209
specific training on security this gives

571
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:42,299
us access to the system settler

572
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:48,299
communications and computer science

573
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:52,439
scientists superior courts it's all

574
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:54,179
available in FPS on the webpage if you

575
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:56,129
look in there you'll see it on there and

576
00:32:54,179 --> 00:33:00,809
you can access the content of the

577
00:32:56,129 --> 00:33:06,168
modules I'd like to point out that we do

578
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:06,168
have modules or subjects as we call them

579
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:13,379
specific in terms of management of

580
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:16,110
incidents and cybersecurity how to

581
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:23,760
manage them how to deal with

582
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:29,879
how to copy all the proof and data there

583
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:31,950
is also computer forensic analysis there

584
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,640
is another module

585
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:39,860
regarding networks and systems it deals

586
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:43,080
with servers routers firewalls and so on

587
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:46,070
the one regarding is safe production

588
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,678
that's developing web applications

589
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:53,460
covering the requirements for in terms

590
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:57,090
of security another one on ethical

591
00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:02,760
hacking as we call it and this is more

592
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:09,810
and towards pentesting and the red teams

593
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:11,960
which many organisms called them and of

594
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:16,020
course there is a module on

595
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:19,168
cybersecurity itself it's important in

596
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,359
terms of protecting cell systems and but

597
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:23,850
also dealing with complying with

598
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,679
regulations and so on there is currently

599
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:28,259
more and more legislation that we have

600
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,918
to comply with so it's important that

601
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,200
technicians are familiar with this and

602
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,580
they understand the expectations that

603
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,580
are coming from a European level

604
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:49,379
so what do we have in this draft

605
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:54,060
document it says that the profiles for

606
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:56,609
this course have the options later and a

607
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,020
professional level consultants in

608
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:00,569
cybersecurity order dissing

609
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:05,450
cybersecurity and experts in

610
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:08,220
cybersecurity I have added operations

611
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:13,290
technicians on level one and level two

612
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:15,540
usually they are in engineers level one

613
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:18,779
and level two technicians can work in

614
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,670
safety operations in companies many of

615
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,710
these are out sourced by different

616
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:25,050
companies because they don't have

617
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:27,710
resources within the company at all to

618
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,710
do themselves

619
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,940
also possible to work in a NOC

620
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:42,880
management of incidents and so on and

621
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:52,690
racing away there is also opportunities

622
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:56,500
as an analyst and Auditor there are also

623
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:59,950
options in order to VM job to work as a

624
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:02,110
civil guard or the central Brigade for

625
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:07,089
investigation in technology for the

626
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:10,000
National Police Force in cyber security

627
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:12,940
it's also possible in order to be Auto

628
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,420
opt for these opportunities within these

629
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:19,300
fields I have mentioned this is an

630
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,950
alternative option is not only the

631
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,410
opportunities are not only in companies

632
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:32,140
and businesses these are alternative

633
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:35,200
options just too and I'll tell you a

634
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:40,089
little bit about the companies with whom

635
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,589
we have some contacts and I've mentioned

636
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:45,550
some of them here just because they

637
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:48,330
collaborate with us and what they're

638
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:51,760
looking for now they have told me is

639
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:57,250
pentesters opportunities in what they

640
00:36:51,760 --> 00:37:00,130
call the red team with regarding

641
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:03,430
technical reports penetration of systems

642
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:07,510
and improving their security in the

643
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:09,730
organization's security auditors also

644
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:13,990
what I was mentioning before level 1 and

645
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:23,230
level 2 operators and remote monitoring

646
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:25,810
these people work in shifts let's need

647
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:29,860
to be checked continually so these

648
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:32,500
people work in shifts and as I was

649
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,900
saying before most in most companies

650
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:39,519
have instance almost every week so this

651
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:42,140
is on the up they have also

652
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:44,660
that vocational people the vacation or

653
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:49,308
training can also help in terms of her

654
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:54,799
consultancies in terms of sales they can

655
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:57,640
help to write offers and reports and we

656
00:37:54,799 --> 00:38:02,930
have students who have worked in

657
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:05,779
awareness training in awareness these

658
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:09,549
people give talks about cybersecurity

659
00:38:05,779 --> 00:38:12,529
grooming sexting and so on these are

660
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:16,038
transversal subjects and we should all

661
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:21,190
be aware of them whether or not we're

662
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:26,599
technicians so some of our students have

663
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:30,140
have also done work of this kind and

664
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:41,959
with this and we'll pass over to our

665
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:44,359
colleague first of all I would like to

666
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:49,640
think in fever for inviting me to take

667
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:51,680
part in this roundtable I've got a

668
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,769
little technical problem and I haven't

669
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,169
been able to bring all the slides that I

670
00:38:54,769 --> 00:39:00,519
have and I wanted to use my browser but

671
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:00,519
I'm not sure that I can use it

672
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:13,630
Hey

673
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:31,030
right sorry about that

674
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:33,490
we've had a little technical problem and

675
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,770
I don't have my slides here but I've

676
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:37,479
really liked the presentations given by

677
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:41,560
my other colleagues I think you have

678
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,210
covered most of everything to do with

679
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,610
cybersecurity and what companies are

680
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:49,440
looking for so I think what we can add

681
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:52,570
up on from universities is regarding

682
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,060
degrees and masters and cybersecurity so

683
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,410
this is our official website for the

684
00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:04,810
Apollo Technical University

685
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:17,440
you've got the link here to studies so

686
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:19,330
we have many different degrees amongst

687
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,170
those related to cybersecurity which

688
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:34,990
could be related to cybersecurity and

689
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:38,200
you can see I come from the computer

690
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:40,990
science schools we've got a degree in

691
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,509
computing the computer science and we

692
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:47,470
look into cyber security in many many

693
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:50,320
subjects so this is one of the degrees

694
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:52,950
that would be an entry point for many

695
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:56,170
companies who are looking for computer

696
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:59,259
engineers we also have a new data

697
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,940
science degree and within that data

698
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:04,000
science degree we've talked a lot about

699
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:08,130
big data and many other related issues

700
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,130
we also have subjects in cybersecurity

701
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:23,990
sorry I'm a bit tall for this table

702
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:36,570
well sorry anyway would you have several

703
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,910
degrees which are related to

704
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:42,090
telecommunications to industrial

705
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:45,029
engineering that could also be relevant

706
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:47,370
to many other aspects of cybersecurity

707
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:49,890
indeed many people who have degrees in

708
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:52,319
telecommunications do access the work

709
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:55,020
market and it has been one of the main

710
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,320
areas for cybersecurity in the last few

711
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,550
years and now currently because of

712
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,740
cybersecurity and industrial

713
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:03,690
environments there are many people from

714
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,080
industrial engineering or civil

715
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:09,840
engineering who are in high demand

716
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,890
because of the particular knowledge that

717
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:15,510
they have so other than this just add I

718
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:26,339
want to be brief

719
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:37,790
so other than bachelor degrees we also

720
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:40,020
have master's degrees and I'm going to

721
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,759
I'm really sorry because this is this

722
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:47,730
table is really low and I cannot see it

723
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,770
well as I was saying the Polytechnic

724
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,840
universities and really have a master's

725
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:53,759
which is specifically on cyber security

726
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,950
but we work in on one which will start

727
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,140
will be launched in September next year

728
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,430
we've got many companies which are

729
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,339
interested among them

730
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:04,080
the lawyer and many others in this

731
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:07,080
master's this is specialized in cyber

732
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:10,080
security and cyber intelligence and as

733
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,610
you can see we have many other masters

734
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,910
on offer right now we've got software

735
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:19,200
engineering when we talk about secure

736
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:21,899
development and we also have master's in

737
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,960
civil engineering that complements the

738
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,980
training that has been given in

739
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,400
The Bachelor degree and also touch upon

740
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,930
cybersecurity

741
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,999
I don't know all the masses but I think

742
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:34,788
we also I'm sure we also have some

743
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:37,038
masses related with cyber intelligence

744
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:38,630
which are also specialized in cyber

745
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,509
security so we have many different

746
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:43,890
trainings that do touch upon cyber

747
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:48,400
security this is all thank you very much

748
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:51,859
[Applause]

749
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:57,470
and finally Emilio Surya from University

750
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:59,990
of Berlin yeah yeah if I could just have

751
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:03,788
the remote so that we can have a mr.

752
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:03,788
sensation here on the background

753
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,019
well Emilio is going to tell us a little

754
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:12,220
bit about the vision or the point of

755
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:12,220
view of the University of Valencia

756
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:50,119
first of all I would like to think in

757
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,339
thievery form inviting me to be here I

758
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:56,440
think everyone has already almost

759
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:58,788
touches upon everything already from the

760
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,010
from our point of view we also have

761
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:04,849
different bachelor degrees will we train

762
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:06,710
about cyber security we actually do you

763
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:09,470
have the masters now inside a security

764
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,390
and I wanted to think a little bit about

765
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:14,720
cyber security for the future of cyber

766
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:17,420
security we've been looking at data and

767
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,629
numbers about the present and because I

768
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:22,760
am the last one I'm going to talk a

769
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,170
little bit about its future so when we

770
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:27,920
talk about security we talk about

771
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:29,440
integrity and security of information so

772
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,079
one a few years ago we had the first

773
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,750
computers were started talking about

774
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,250
viruses those of us who already have a

775
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:40,670
few white hairs in my case I don't have

776
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:44,329
any hair at all well for eyes there was

777
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:46,819
a big thing then we had mobile phones

778
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:49,210
which at the beginning were only used to

779
00:45:46,819 --> 00:45:51,079
speak but when they started having

780
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,809
applications instead of being attacked

781
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:58,359
as well so that was the next stage then

782
00:45:53,809 --> 00:46:03,799
it went on to industrial devices and

783
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:06,140
program programmable automatons and then

784
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:08,269
we moved on to intensive care units in

785
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:11,328
hospitals and many other applications in

786
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:13,490
medicine and I think in the future the

787
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:15,559
next device there's going to be attacked

788
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,578
and they will give a lot of work it's

789
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:19,400
going to be us

790
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:21,559
said I was talking about fake news a lot

791
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,480
lately and yes yesterday there was a

792
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:27,980
video of Nixon the former president well

793
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,750
he was sending a message completely

794
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,569
different to the message that he would

795
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:36,130
have sent so I think the next devices

796
00:46:32,569 --> 00:46:38,480
are going to be attacked as us are us um

797
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:41,930
artificial intelligence systems can

798
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,000
generate videos and texts that seem to

799
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:46,640
have been generated by human beings and

800
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,900
whenever I go to companies I mentioned

801
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,839
this if you

802
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,900
a video of your boss saying you have to

803
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:55,910
delete your hard drive from your

804
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,650
computer don't do it because you never

805
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,029
know if it's really your boss saying

806
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,869
that because right now with three

807
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:05,450
pictures we can have a full video of

808
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:08,720
someone saying whatever you want them to

809
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:13,788
say so this is concerning devices

810
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:17,029
everything to do with fake news bots all

811
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:20,960
that is going to give a lot of work in

812
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:25,640
this field and now concerning techniques

813
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:28,400
I've been looking into the different

814
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,859
speeches about IOT big tater and

815
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,490
artificial intelligence shows the fact

816
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:37,670
of working in this industries means that

817
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:39,288
you going to have surely a job because

818
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:42,799
for example in cybersecurity one of the

819
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:45,369
techniques that and it's being most used

820
00:47:42,799 --> 00:47:49,519
is anomaly detection which is almost

821
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:52,099
like looking for something which is

822
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,529
really difficult to find so for example

823
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:59,210
predictive maintenance for machines or

824
00:47:54,529 --> 00:48:02,869
fraud detection for credit cards so

825
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:04,609
studying cybersecurity will open up many

826
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:06,589
opportunities in other applications than

827
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:19,308
that said laughs I've got one minute

828
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:21,019
left thank you now we would like to give

829
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:23,259
the floor to all of you who are here

830
00:48:21,019 --> 00:48:27,348
today in case you have any questions

831
00:48:23,259 --> 00:48:30,349
either for all of our guests or all of

832
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:32,839
us all for someone in particular I don't

833
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:34,009
know if anyone would like to ask a

834
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:44,299
question yeah we have a question over

835
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:47,289
there hello good morning we are

836
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:49,040
currently studying a multi-platform

837
00:48:47,289 --> 00:48:50,299
application development

838
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,369
[Music]

839
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:55,200
until we have this one-year

840
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:57,089
specialization in vocational training

841
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,910
for cybersecurity what do you recommend

842
00:48:57,089 --> 00:49:08,849
we do can we do any of them training any

843
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:09,930
anything else well I'm going to answer

844
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:11,579
because there you were asking about

845
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:14,160
vocational training but I think anyone

846
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:16,950
else can answer I think other than what

847
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,618
you could do yourself and train and

848
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:21,808
teach yourself if you're talking about

849
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:23,369
formal education or certifications I

850
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:27,349
would recommend if you would like to

851
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:30,180
invest in certifications if you like

852
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:32,130
security for example because when it

853
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:35,279
comes to vocational training unless you

854
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:37,440
want to do an engineering degree if you

855
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:40,980
have time and if you like it and you can

856
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:43,549
even do a online or distance learning

857
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:45,990
but you can also train from

858
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:48,839
certification certified ethical hacker

859
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:51,959
is one I recommend very highly it's

860
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:54,660
something that you can study full it has

861
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:59,160
a very high level of technicality but it

862
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:01,499
can open many doors or just be

863
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:03,239
self-taught you know that's why I say

864
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,029
very often though most of the things

865
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:09,059
that I'm teaching right now I've learned

866
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:10,799
myself if you undergo formal training

867
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:13,650
that helps you structure your mind and

868
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:14,999
having some discipline but most of the

869
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:16,950
things that you learn are going to be

870
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:21,029
obsolete very quickly so you have to be

871
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:22,348
continuously training thank you very

872
00:50:21,029 --> 00:50:25,489
much I don't know if we have another

873
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:25,489
question there's another one over here

874
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:35,190
hey good morning my question deals with

875
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:37,098
we've been hearing a lot of information

876
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:39,930
about technical requirements especially

877
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:43,650
concerning the different educational

878
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:46,890
paths but how about law communication

879
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:49,499
other areas which are actually linked to

880
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:54,239
this industry and how how is that going

881
00:50:49,499 --> 00:50:55,470
to be looked into for education we're

882
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:56,999
very happy you asked that because that

883
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,589
was one of the things that we wanted to

884
00:50:56,999 --> 00:50:59,959
talk about and something they had been

885
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:02,509
asked before I don't know if you know

886
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:05,359
would like to say something about how it

887
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:11,270
is true that security affects many

888
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:14,630
different disciplines and Alejandro I

889
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:17,480
think was saying that cyber crime is

890
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:20,630
very very profitable so we're finding

891
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,869
many different cases which are not just

892
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:26,030
physical but digital and we need lawyers

893
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:30,680
when in jurists in general who know

894
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:33,260
about this so what are we doing from the

895
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:39,680
point of view of a formal training to

896
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:41,720
complement those aspects have you

897
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,230
studying law congratulations because

898
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,270
with the new Data Protection Directive

899
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:49,160
and everything and everything that we've

900
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:53,900
been talking about at the end of day it

901
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:55,250
is data that we're talking about all the

902
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,220
time and there's many professional

903
00:51:55,250 --> 00:52:02,900
opportunities and in our research group

904
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:05,980
there's a worldwide renowned specialist

905
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:09,410
in a behavioral economy because the

906
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:12,740
weakest link on the chain is always the

907
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:14,779
user you can have the highest security

908
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,819
from a technological point of view but

909
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,430
if that if the user doesn't know how to

910
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:21,980
do things if they didn't abide by all

911
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:25,460
the rules then you have prepared for

912
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:27,530
them then you have a really big issue so

913
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:29,270
out what this expert was analyzing its

914
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:33,440
what incentives you would have to give

915
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:36,859
the final user so that they don't decide

916
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:41,869
to just not abide by those security

917
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:44,299
rules I would like to also add I also

918
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:45,650
congratulate you if you're studying law

919
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,180
and if you want to specialize in cyber

920
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,550
security you're going to have a lot of

921
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:52,250
work because you can see there are loads

922
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,810
of regulations as many people who have

923
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,420
studied computer science and

924
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:57,820
telecommunications who do not know about

925
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:02,320
laws and

926
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:05,260
cannot deal with them you will probably

927
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:08,260
know that legislation in Spanish called

928
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:10,480
the same as in Italy France Japan United

929
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:12,970
States or India so there are many

930
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,340
companies who are facing many issues

931
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:18,640
when they try to export a product abroad

932
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:20,020
and the cyber security requirements are

933
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,450
completely different to the ones that we

934
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:25,450
have here so it's that easy so if you

935
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:28,029
study law and for example Polytechnical

936
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:31,720
University we have many postgraduate

937
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:33,670
studies of which lasts about six months

938
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,740
one year that would help you specialize

939
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:39,040
in cybersecurity if you wanted to so if

940
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:40,720
you do law you speak English and you

941
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:44,070
have a specialization in cybersecurity

942
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:48,459
then you will definitely find a job and

943
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:49,750
from in theory I would like to also say

944
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,660
that because this is a very

945
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:54,700
multidisciplinary area when it comes to

946
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:56,950
law education everything is

947
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:59,620
interconnected we need psychologists we

948
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:01,480
need trainers who know how to work in

949
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:03,549
their secure environments and raise

950
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,800
awareness so it is true that we have

951
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:07,780
more and more training every day not

952
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:11,800
only technical training but now we have

953
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:16,180
post graduates and a master's in cyber

954
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:19,470
security and industrial security law and

955
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:21,910
we also have vocational training and

956
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:25,720
university level training which is

957
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:28,180
focusing on the fact that any discipline

958
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,220
needs a cybersecurity component nowadays

959
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:33,580
because we do live in a hyper-connected

960
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:35,529
world for better or for worse and so

961
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:39,759
this is something that we're working on

962
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:42,430
and if unfortunately the specialization

963
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,290
the youth fight and at some point they

964
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:47,020
you if your degree it's not specialized

965
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:50,580
in cybersecurity it is important to have

966
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:53,460
some training as a complement both

967
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:57,040
vocational training or higher education

968
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:58,690
or certifications well we've run out of

969
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,130
time I would like to thank everyone

970
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:02,320
who's been here with me in the

971
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,970
roundtable today and finally I just

972
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,900
wanted I don't know if you could show

973
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:07,868
them

974
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,579
it's light I wanted to show you the

975
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:13,769
activities that we have in relation with

976
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:17,079
this roundtable today at cyber camp and

977
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:20,258
then some activities will continue over

978
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:23,109
time so you have employment and talent

where they're going to be able to assess

990
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:54,819
your CV if you have it with you they

991

attractive how to change it so that it's

993
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:04,450
it is attractive from employments we

994
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,999
also have training for job interviews

995
