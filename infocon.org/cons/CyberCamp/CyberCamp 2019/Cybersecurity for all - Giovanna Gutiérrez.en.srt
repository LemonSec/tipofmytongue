[Music]

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,770
see how order in the future yes well

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,730
thank you so much to you and Phoebe and

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:25,859
everyone who is here and sharing this

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:29,099
morning with us and in this case with so

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,009
interesting subject of cybersecurity and

7
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,360
I think cybersecurity has to be aimed at

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,329
all types of audiences when I came in I

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,969
said people you're dancing and doing

10
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,660
different kinds of sports and I asked my

11
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:50,190
age I'm not even ex generation my baby

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:54,629
boomer I would recommend a sea bear to

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:58,140
have maybe yoga or pilot session more

14
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,718
we're here there you know and we could

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,489
learn the vocabulary linked to

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,890
cybersecurity and and do something which

17
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,840
is more adapted to us because we have

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,520
two options from my generation my say oh

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,159
this is awful

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,520
I've gotten off with my whatsapp and it

21
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,670
does what I need to do and then be happy

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,979
and then find that the digital gap

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,020
becomes bigger and bigger every day

24
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,750
because we are surrounded by technology

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,780
everywhere because our fridge has this

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,790
and that and things call you and Madonna

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,310
and then the supermarket comes he M

28
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,439
brings coffee to your home oh you have

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,750
another option your and you can say no

30
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,990
I'm going to Train but first of all we

31
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,930
need to raise awareness and secondly we

32
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,589
need to off the training so add in

33
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,470
Phoebe in lea in Leon I did tell the

34
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:59,130
former manager and I would like to tell

35
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:03,630
the new director we need a cyber camp

36
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:07,590
for seniors so having said that let's

37
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,250
start and see why we need that sort of

38
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,250
cyber camp

39
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,739
ah sorry could you tell me what I have

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:23,489
to press sir the flight change could you

41
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:26,159
tell me how this works please oh there

42
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:29,599
we go thank you so much it was just an

43
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:33,298
excuse to getting closer to me oh well

44
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:37,620
well as I was saying I'm going to talk

45
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:41,310
about benefits prejudices and many other

46
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:44,430
things that we usually think we know but

47
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,720
which are surrounding us and the people

48
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,129
from a generation needs to get to know

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,139
at some point you won't even realize

50
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,540
that you're not getting your money into

51
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,819
the bank because there are banks which

52
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,858
are telling you that you cannot check

53
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,200
anything if you didn't download the app

54
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:05,579
and well I'll show you what it means for

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,858
us to download an app so first of all so

56
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:11,670
we're saying are we do we have enough

57
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:14,310
knowledge does this affect society in

58
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:17,488
the same way all of society what do you

59
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:22,919
think yes no does it affect all of us

60
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:25,169
Yeah right then get a move on and so

61
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,000
we'll see that there are tools because

62
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,419
we've been talking about many tools

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,730
during these days and these are very

64
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:36,690
specialized tools but I go piano Keller

65
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:43,370
and I will tell you it once I think I

66
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:49,109
should be telling you oh ma roughly

67
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:52,169
around 1945 he was the last US general

68
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:54,659
in the Second World War and said if we

69
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:59,430
keep developing our technology without

70
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:03,120
knowledge and without prudence our

71
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,129
server could have become our key lasting

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,799
and I think that is exactly what's

73
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:14,519
happening right now what can I tell you

74
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,519
about the benefits of communication and

75
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,010
IT interconnection flexibility

76
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,279
convergence you can get surgery heart

77
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,610
surgery but does someone tell you about

78
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,610
the

79
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:38,229
it means the amount of a almonds it's so

80
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:42,068
numerous superficiality social isolation

81
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:45,128
to to know by the way that every 2.5

82
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:46,060
hours commit suicide in Spain I'm not

83
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:49,449
saying the business because of

84
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:52,180
communication technology but social

85
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:55,960
isolation is very important cyber

86
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,969
harassment digital gap not only people

87
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,349
my age but also people who do not have

88
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:05,250
access to technologies I am part of an

89
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:10,360
association Confederation in Malaga and

90
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:15,340
people from sources who make who produce

91
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,770
raining racing's communicate with very

92
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,878
very rudimentary ways and now Montero is

93
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,219
saying our Minister for taxes that we

94
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:26,560
need a digital signature for everything

95
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:32,080
so what happens with people who use very

96
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:39,460
rudimentary ways of communication what

97
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:42,250
can we do because your fridge and your

98
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:46,719
car and you washing machine and all the

99
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:50,789
things that you multiplying the amount

100
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:50,789
of solution that we have in our world

101
00:05:51,419 --> 00:06:00,729
we're going to have the climate

102
00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:03,039
conference in in Madrid and well we are

103
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:05,080
going to keep using energy in the same

104
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,938
way only because we fail well because we

105
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,758
have that conference taking place here

106
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:12,699
and then they were saying that there

107
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:18,219
were girls who would get one kilo of

108
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:20,409
food social project every hour that they

109
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:22,689
want without their phone and the one who

110
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:25,539
spent the most hours without their phone

111
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:29,439
spend 23 hours although they did manage

112
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:31,060
to get 400 kilos anyway there are many

113
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:35,259
many things I haven't really talked

114
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,690
about the digital gap and I think we

115
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:39,380
have to overcome that

116
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:44,790
do you know what social engineering is

117
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:48,510
because at they don't tell us the truth

118
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:51,510
because if they say when they say social

119
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,680
I think about solidarity but something

120
00:06:51,510 --> 00:07:01,969
good but do you know what social

121
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:07,620
engineering is yes tell us exactly

122
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:15,360
everything people use to make us believe

123
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:19,200
the things which you know not I've

124
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,910
already talked to all the actors consent

125
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,349
on this to change the name because when

126
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,290
I think so sure I think of something

127
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:27,960
good the social engineering is obtaining

128
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:31,620
confidential information by manipulating

129
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,469
the legitimate uses and they say that

130
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,690
and that's it right no this is a scam

131
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,780
this is social scam not social

132
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:43,460
engineering

133
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:51,530
well the users are the weakest link and

134
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:51,530
that is why I think how about Fiona

135
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,910
Institute who's already checking now

136
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,830
where are you going where you're not

137
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:02,730
going this is a study that took place

138
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,830
last week in the plains Baba it doesn't

139
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,200
matter they can follow what you do

140
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:11,370
because you're not going to say who you

141
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:15,719
are and they're selling our data yeah

142
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:18,180
for that study and are we ready for

143
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,140
what's coming or what's already going on

144
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,910
how about fishing oh you already know

145
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,820
someone calls you someone says you're an

146
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:30,480
email or just change your bank's

147
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:33,390
password in my time this was always in

148
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,300
good faith all the director of the bank

149
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,179
has called me I am very proud and now

150
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,370
you give them their password and they

151
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,430
take all the money from your account and

152
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,770
how about social media oh yeah I've got

153
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,410
Facebook oh oh yeah I use Instagram I

154
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,500
didn't use Facebook anymore

155
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,630
Oh uses Instagram but did you know that

156
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,060
the picture of your grants and the you

157
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,189
just uploaded is being sold by a man in

158
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,079
Australia no no but it's fine because I

159
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,500
upload it well no actually it isn't

160
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,960
because you upload it onto the Internet

161
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:10,490
anyway if I came across all those people

162
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,000
from Facebook does anyone know what the

163
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,790
cloud is

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:20,120
I have no idea whatsoever route route

165
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:22,640
cloud is a trend isn't it we're all

166
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,540
going towards the cloud cloud computing

167
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,840
that sounds so smart and then they say

168
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,990
we're going to give you computing

169
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,060
services through the cloud that you're

170
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,980
not going to have to buy anything

171
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:45,170
anymore because Amazon has everything

172
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:49,460
Google has everything all that stuff all

173
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:52,370
I can say is be very careful with this

174
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,710
famous cloud because there are 50,000

175
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,090
Chinese people getting ready to get

176
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,970
everything you have loading reading

177
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,500
everything and spreading it amongst

178
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,300
themselves so be careful with the cloud

179
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,330
it's true we're not going to do a lot of

180
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:09,140
fear now at my age but just be careful

181
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,700
with the cloud because and the cloud

182
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,680
they want to get everything connected

183
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,020
all those things your fridge and

184
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,239
everything else and the more things you

185
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:23,300
open the more doors

186
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:26,030
you open you know that if you have two

187
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,660
daughters very difficult to monitor

188
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:32,120
who's coming in and out your home so

189
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,089
that you've got your doors your tablet

190
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,460
your phone your your car your fridge

191
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:42,620
everything is connected in the cloud

192
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:49,640
well this is really pulling your leg the

193
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:53,450
famous cookie has it not happen to you

194
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,010
but you say oh I'm going with my friends

195
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:59,440
to Lisbon just in the weekend

196
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,720
and you go on the site and you see that

197
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,420
the flight costs a hundred euros and you

198
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,339
say whoa I found a ticket for 100 euros

199
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,729
you can find it in this in that way you

200
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:13,060
go on again it's 150 but why it was a

201
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,209
hundred only half an hour ago oh you

202
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,699
know so foreign demand no it's because

203
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:21,130
they give you a number there on your

204
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:22,899
phone and it's tracking you number seven

205
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,839
where is where is she now it's got an

206
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,740
iPhone it's got money she's in Madrid

207
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,310
his price goes up

208
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,470
oh she's swarthy - but she doesn't have

209
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,050
money anymore so we'll put the price

210
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:39,339
down so that she or she doesn't have

211
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:42,010
battery I meant so they put the price

212
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:43,600
down so you male then they register your

213
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,069
behavior but game information about your

214
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,589
behaviour whatever you download you've

215
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,970
got it there oh how about apps I've

216
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,980
already mentioned that when talking

217
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:57,430
about banks it's another way of being

218
00:11:50,980 --> 00:12:00,070
spied upon remotely you download to get

219
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:04,630
a torch and that torch has access to

220
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:08,889
your son's phone how why we really need

221
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:13,899
to know how to stop where we have to set

222
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:16,720
boundaries and we just want a torch to

223
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:19,529
light up that's all we want because then

224
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,790
they have the nerve to say well the

225
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:23,709
services for free so who is the product

226
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,389
it will be you right why are you

227
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,750
complaining I'm giving you things for

228
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:30,279
free I was saying to some friends the

229
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,850
other day but this reminds me of when I

230
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,610
used to go and buy some because when you

231
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,560
bought Simon they gave you the Simon and

232
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,310
then a piece of the hair can I throw out

233
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,709
on the head please you just won the

234
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:48,130
salmon everyone takes a piece of the

235
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:51,219
head I don't mind I don't mind paying

236
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:54,069
more but I don't want the head so to all

237
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,949
these engineers and people I would say

238
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:59,649
well make me pay more but stop spying on

239
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:02,800
me because I think technology is all

240
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:06,220
very good but I don't want you to spy on

241
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,819
me now so this is just a short

242
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:13,580
introduction about salad and now

243
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:17,480
let's get into it because we have virus

244
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,940
that attack worms Trojans mutants

245
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,870
mmm blah blah whatever there's a new one

246
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:28,550
every day this is like olive oil isn't

247
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,260
it in my time olive oil was awful really

248
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,209
bad for you and now it's really good

249
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,430
well in my time hackers were really bad

250
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,740
people and now the really good people so

251
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,800
those bad people are the crackers so

252
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:44,840
hacker is good cracker is bad see I'm

253
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:47,020
starting to get but this is really

254
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,020
difficult

255
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:56,660
now how about is cyber harassment this

256
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:02,870
is quite serious actually this is one of

257
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:05,420
the biggest and according to the wuh-oh

258
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,240
Spain is one of the countries where this

259
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:13,880
means cyber harassment actually 70% of

260
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,380
girls suffer it and boys only 30% but

261
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,250
this is something that we really really

262
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,700
need to stop including cyber bullying

263
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:24,350
which is I think young people we've got

264
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:30,670
different times

265
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:33,830
grooming which is pretending that

266
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,360
sexting that affects both children and

267
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,220
teenagers you take a picture for your

268
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,230
boyfriend you censor and you know how

269
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,660
this works

270
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:45,080
extortion well there are many many many

271
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,900
sites so if it's granny doesn't know

272
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:52,730
about this and then the granny cannot

273
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:56,780
help their grandchildren and and help

274
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:59,960
them and show them the way now we're

275
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:04,030
getting to the worst part access to

276
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:09,560
pornography that young people now have

277
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:16,910
and this means that women can be

278
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:19,760
harassed relationship in Spain have

279
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,430
increased incredibly and 43% with

280
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,360
regards to

281
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:32,060
- last year in terms of group group rape

282
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:34,639
in Spain with so there's sexual abuse

283
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,369
and Agri civet II and this is being

284
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:45,440
transmitted as if it were normal not

285
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:48,680
love and passion so I think engineers

286
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,110
need to find a way of ensuring that

287
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:57,380
pornography does not reach young people

288
00:15:51,110 --> 00:16:01,250
so easily so what about artificial

289
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:06,980
intelligence do you think this is male

290
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:11,120
chauvinist or not so many engineers hear

291
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:14,120
so much silence here we have Khan she

292
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:22,130
she's an expert what about Eddie what do

293
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:24,759
you think yes or no what do you think

294
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,759
out there

295
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:39,700
I think artificial intelligence if it

296
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,620
learns from the information that it

297
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,990
receives it depends what the world

298
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:48,100
itself is like you're absolutely right

299
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,940
absolutely right you hit the nail on the

300
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:56,950
head I went back for a moment let me

301
00:16:51,940 --> 00:17:00,640
just say so if you learn a language and

302
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:03,070
if you learn language that has been

303
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:08,250
distorted then that is what you in you

304
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:11,440
you believe in there are sexist

305
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:16,720
translation systems such as the Google

306
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,610
translation system we're talking about

307
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,920
Turkish where there is no

308
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:26,740
differentiation between gender and there

309
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:32,140
are cases of when it says doctor when

310
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:36,460
somebody is actually an nurse only 15%

311
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:44,160
in face book of artificial intelligence

312
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:47,110
and 10% in Google and a 18% of people

313
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,300
going online are actually women in terms

314
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,199
of artificial intelligence so we need to

315
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:55,210
do things to correct this situation

316
00:17:52,200 --> 00:18:05,740
because it will be increasingly male

317
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:10,200
chauvinist at what the police release is

318
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:14,530
Biogen regarding violence against women

319
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,990
saying that there will be activities to

320
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:20,590
avoid gender violence which is

321
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:27,130
increasing and that the will increased

322
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:29,949
prediction of reoccurring offenders so

323
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:33,330
this is why it's very very important

324
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:40,240
that we increasingly have young women

325
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:43,540
who study stem degrees and I would like

326
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,050
to say something I would like to say

327
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,389
that there was gentle

328
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,610
who was talking earlier don't if he's

329
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:53,809
here now

330
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:56,570
but I'd like to point out that apart

331
00:18:53,809 --> 00:19:00,200
from the fact that you do a wonderful

332
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:03,790
job here but we need to do a job we need

333
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:07,820
to work with the mathematicians and the

334
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:11,330
teachers of maths in Spain if teachers

335
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:15,050
are bad in Spain what you're going to

336
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,428
achieve if teachers say to you if you're

337
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,540
this is awful if you're going to be

338
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,650
studying this you're going to spend your

339
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:24,530
whole life studying and they oriented

340
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:27,590
towards young men and we have to work

341
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:34,940
with maths teachers in this country in

342
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:38,120
this sense I think maths is on the

343
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:42,470
increase now and there's been an

344
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:45,050
increase of women in maths degrees now

345
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:48,470
because it deals a lot with artificial

346
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:54,610
intelligence and I think this is a point

347
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:57,260
that is growing and we have big innocent

348
00:19:54,610 --> 00:20:01,699
representatives of the women and

349
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:03,860
mathematicians and maths in Spain what

350
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,650
I'm saying is that teachers need to be

351
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:10,520
good teachers that's what I'm trying to

352
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:13,190
say because according to a study one of

353
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:17,090
the big issues that we have in terms of

354
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:18,830
engineering and men and women this was

355
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:23,300
one of the big issues that came out in a

356
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:27,159
recent study so if they say so it must

357
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,159
be true I'm not going to go against that

358
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:34,340
so we need to help young women in STEM

359
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,700
degrees but we'll see to have good

360
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:43,520
teachers 50 or 80% of professions

361
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,640
depending on who you listen to in the

362
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,160
future we are unaware of currently but

363
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,730
they will all be related to technology

364
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:58,610
so it's very very important that we help

365
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,059
those algorithms to come out if you want

366
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,629
to

367
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:06,110
study philosophy you always you also

368
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:07,370
need to have people with ethics within

369
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,668
that field I need to have people with

370
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:15,258
ethics within cybersecurity and in

371
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:20,870
artificial intelligence and what about

372
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:22,929
fake news I'm a journalist so who's

373
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:29,209
behind this political parties

374
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:32,210
corporations great companies and you're

375
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,909
being told lies or they change

376
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:37,759
presidents or they talk about the Amazon

377
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:42,220
or different situations in countries

378
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,220
brexit the Russians and so on and so on

379
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:52,809
this is all around us in our day today

380
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,809
so it's very important to point this out

381
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:03,139
there are businesses one a particular

382
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:05,990
maldita dot yes that deals specifically

383
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:16,758
with this and it's being attacked

384
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:18,110
continually we are not machines are we

385
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:23,539
happy with everything that we have

386
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:26,240
around us an expert in positive

387
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:30,369
psychology who said that quantitative

388
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:35,200
measures make sense to machines but

389
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:38,299
human lives were not created like that

390
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:42,429
do we need to earn more money do we need

391
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:47,799
to be more famous do we need more light

392
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:47,799
this is what what it creates is stress

393
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:57,080
we're surrounded about all the things

394
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:59,899
that we could enjoy but actually what we

395
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,899
do and what we end up having is

396
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:07,039
depression and stress and so on and so

397
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:10,908
on I would suggest that engineers should

398
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:14,690
try and create a less stressful and

399
00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:17,539
- TIF world a bit more quality I don't

400
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:21,489
know if that's possible but I think we

401
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:26,629
would be happier so a few pieces of

402
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:28,940
advice from my humble opinion get in

403
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:33,978
touch with the OSI the office for

404
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:36,590
security for uses of the internet their

405
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,419
tools to help you and they encourage you

406
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:43,488
you need to learn the necessary things

407
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:46,999
about this field and it's also helpful

408
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:49,009
if somebody is harassing you because if

409
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:51,019
somebody is harassing you in a normal

410
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:52,729
world in my opinion the normal thing to

411
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:56,989
do would be to call the police I've been

412
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:58,940
I'm being harassed they're not going to

413
00:23:56,989 --> 00:24:01,609
pay you any attention we're going to

414
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,029
explain that many many people make these

415
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:07,099
same calls every day is there a

416
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:09,769
telephone number or an email address

417
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:17,418
that can write to to talk about this

418
00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:20,749
no there is no no there really isn't if

419
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:22,309
you pull that number then what they tell

420
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:26,509
you is that you have to go and make a

421
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:27,859
report so it's not as easy it looks so

422
00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:31,999
let's avoid this

423
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:34,489
let's have prevention tools and in in

424
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:39,409
fever itself you can get some formation

425
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:41,950
about this and then you can move forward

426
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:47,229
and talk to the police

427
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:49,879
so using webcams and covering webcams I

428
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:52,279
should do this every day because I

429
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:53,719
always walk around at home perhaps with

430
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:58,609
my clothes on and I forget about things

431
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:01,970
and I'm walking around happy so why

432
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:04,460
should I cover my webcam spying through

433
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:08,690
a mobile what are we talking about here

434
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,399
oh they're encouraging you to buy and

435
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:17,960
buy and buy now I've already mentioned

436
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:21,989
this house words everybody here will

437
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,490
know here but other people may

438
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:27,870
you need to have at least eight

439
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:33,480
characters capital letters and numbers

440
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:36,750
and different characters once you've

441
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,610
done it one time then somebody else

442
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:42,660
comes along says something different and

443
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:52,080
changes the idea so do what you think is

444
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:59,520
best I've got a list of all my passwords

445
00:25:52,080 --> 00:26:00,750
and so on got them in a given place and

446
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,990
sometimes they say oh it's got to be

447
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:07,650
encrypted and then you encrypt it and

448
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:10,470
then you forget it okay so do whatever

449
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:15,750
you can you got to concentrate on being

450
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:17,610
happy so remove all your applications or

451
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:20,670
the tools that you're not using because

452
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:24,449
they're the door of entry and they also

453
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,920
use up your battery so maybe you need

454
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,720
somebody to help you to do this because

455
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,920
you might end up with no my book mobile

456
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:35,760
at all disconnect your Wi-Fi when you

457
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:37,790
leave home and remove all the data I

458
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,129
don't know if I'm capable of doing this

459
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,870
and sometimes I ended up I tried doing

460
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:46,590
it and ended up with no data at all who

461
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:49,649
can I call now use your common sense

462
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:51,919
of course you have to try encourage

463
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:55,590
people and these are my conclusions

464
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,660
cyber security might say see sim seems

465
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,300
something that that doesn't affect you

466
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,720
but it does affect us in our day-to-day

467
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:06,629
we need to get trained and we need to be

468
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:11,370
aware of what is going on and we need to

469
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:14,310
teach people about digital devices we

470
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:19,679
have to integrate and try to progress

471
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:23,610
and of course we have to close that

472
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:26,670
gender gap because as I was saying cyber

473
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,530
security is for everyone thank you very

474
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:34,950
much

475
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:38,110
[Applause]

476
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,929
if you have any questions we've got

477
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:44,590
about three minutes I believe now you

478
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:49,690
know nobody you already know a lot about

479
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:51,959
all of this it's been a pleasure to be

480
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,960
here

481
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:02,799
I would love our associate of women for

482
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:05,439
dialogue and education to offer their

483
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,769
support if you are interested in taking

484
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:14,139
the first steps because we do workshops

485
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:16,289
on emotional intelligence because we say

486
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:18,490
well if we're going to do talks about

487
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:23,730
business let's talk about cyber security

488
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,730
as well so that's all just be happy

489
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,490
[Applause]

490
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,490
you
