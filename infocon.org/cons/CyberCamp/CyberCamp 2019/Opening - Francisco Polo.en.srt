19
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,799
people who will be protecting us from

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:25,350
the risks in a few years time we hope

21
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,140
you truly enjoy cyber camp and all the

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,600
activities that we've prepared first of

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,970
all so that you have fun so that you

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,140
learn more about cyber security and

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:40,850
above all so that you dream and dream

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,850
big about this field

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,640
cyber security yes has a lot to do with

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,880
that despite protecting people and

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,540
creating a better world

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:57,060
I love sniper camp because I see you I

31
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,780
see you learning I see you competing in

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,090
the challenges that we put on for you

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:09,179
and what I see as young people with a

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:12,780
lot of talent in this very room we might

35
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,060
have the becoming president of the next

36
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,830
be

37
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:20,080
company in the world of technology

38
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,380
perhaps here we have the young girl

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,530
young man who will become the person who

40
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,060
will create the next digital service

41
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:33,489
that will improve the lives of millions

42
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:41,890
of people all of you everyone here today

43
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:46,060
can go as far as you want and as you can

44
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:48,760
see are talking about girls and boys in

45
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,150
all of these cases and obviously I do

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,760
this on purpose I do this knowingly

47
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,440
because I know that young girls in

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,630
particular need to be taken into account

49
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:03,250
as much as young men so why am I saying

50
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,750
this with people you know if this is

51
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:10,720
their normal thing but in actual fact

52
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,060
only three in every 100 people have

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,150
received a Nobel Prize have been women

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,180
over the course of history does this

55
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:24,579
mean that goes don't have as much talent

56
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:28,380
what do you think but Society some years

57
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:32,079
ago wasn't capable of seeing the huge

58
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:34,569
things that so many many women have done

59
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:39,690
for science for engineering and for

60
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:44,470
technology women such as one cine a

61
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:47,970
young Chinese scientist who was alive at

62
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,970
the end of the 18th century

63
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:57,220
she was prohibited from studying but she

64
00:03:53,410 --> 00:04:00,730
didn't pay heed she decided not to study

65
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:05,380
one degree for mathematics astronomy

66
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:09,160
medicine and how did she do this if it

67
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:11,260
wasn't allowed her grandfather told him

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,639
taught her about astronomy her father

69
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,959
about mathematics geography and on top

70
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:23,890
of all of this

71
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:26,860
her grandmother also a taught she was

72
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:30,250
such a hard worker and so brave

73
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,139
that she realized that the days were

74
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,009
longer in the summer and shorter in the

75
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:41,129
winter and she also realized that in

76
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:46,139
spring and an autumn day and night

77
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:46,139
lasted exactly the same lengths of time

78
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,318
and while she didn't have the tools that

79
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:55,240
we have today she was able to calculate

80
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:59,129
exactly the day in March in the day in

81
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,129
September on which this would happen

82
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,359
this was an incredible discovery but in

83
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,280
fact almost nobody knows who this lady

84
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,159
is

85
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:19,029
almost nobody remembers her name this is

86
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:24,490
very very interesting that this woman

87
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:28,210
made to science here today we also have

88
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,550
many examples of scientists here and in

89
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,979
Spain female scientists and inventors

90
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:37,690
who have not been given the recognition

91
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:40,779
that they deserve I don't know if you

92
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:44,469
know that's the first mechanic's book

93
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:49,509
that was her first maid was invented in

94
00:05:44,469 --> 00:06:03,940
actual fact by a Spanish one woman her

95
00:05:49,509 --> 00:06:11,069
name's Angela Ruth Robles in 1985 was

96
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:11,069
the inventor of the first Ybor in 1949

97
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:18,219
but if we go back to its michael hart an

98
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,008
American gentleman who figures as the

99
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:23,650
person who was responsible for that an

100
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:25,889
actual fact his invention came later on

101
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:29,289
than the Spanish lady

102
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:31,539
neither the scientific community nor any

103
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:35,259
companies interested were interested in

104
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:38,400
what she had to offer since that time

105
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:40,740
the world has changed significantly

106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,698
and we still have to make an effort so

107
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:48,290
that men and women are given the same

108
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:48,290
opportunities and considered as equals

109
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:55,410
we need more girls young women to work

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,960
in the field of engineering and

111
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:02,789
mathematics and science there are very

112
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,448
few women working in the field of

113
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:08,729
cybersecurity

114
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:13,050
currently we are talking about this

115
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:14,669
earlier on the manager of eBay she was

116
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,240
the first woman to become the general

117
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:22,620
manager of this Institute and I hope she

118
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,930
will be the first of many we need more

119
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,639
young women to become professionals in

120
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:32,460
the field of cybersecurity first of all

121
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,729
in order to protect our networks and our

122
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:39,120
technological tools we need these teams

123
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:42,570
of people teams of different people who

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,930
are able to provide different points of

125
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:50,219
view and different to their male

126
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:52,500
colleagues we need women in sectors

127
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,110
where there will be many many

128
00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:02,310
opportunities from a professional point

129
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:05,280
of view young women you are very very

130
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:09,419
lucky to live in this very exciting time

131
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,280
of history we are in the digital area an

132
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:15,510
area that will change everything and

133
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,460
that change will be quicker and more and

134
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:21,570
have more impact than it ever has in the

135
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:24,388
past all of you young men and young

136
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,550
women can have big dreams because you

137
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:29,970
have the opportunity to change the world

138
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:35,640
and to make it into the world that you

139
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:40,400
want it to be like the world of tomorrow

140
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:43,140
to be more equal for men and women and

141
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,970
secretary of state I try to do

142
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,029
everything in order to ensure that that

143
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,029
happens

144
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:52,959
now it's your turn to think about how

145
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,689
you would like that world to be and make

146
00:08:52,959 --> 00:09:00,518
the effort to make that dream come true

147
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:02,349
on behalf of the government I'd like to

148
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:05,529
say that we are working so that

149
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:08,819
cybersecurity is recognized in Spain and

150
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:11,499
give him the position that it deserves

151
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:13,599
cybersecurity is one of the big issues

152
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:19,360
that we have in our society without

153
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:23,730
cybersecurity without safe networks make

154
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,829
our dreams of a better Spain come true

155
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,790
the digital world is present in all

156
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:35,258
areas of our lives without cybersecurity

157
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:42,730
there won't be a future so this is why

158
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:45,369
we're making in TB we and have 17 more

159
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:50,230
professionals over the coming year

160
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:52,240
working with us full-time would like

161
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,209
more opportunities here in Spain and for

162
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,179
more young women to work professionally

163
00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:06,699
in the field of cybersecurity but we

164
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:09,040
have to start working here today so we

165
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:12,279
hope cyber camp will continue everywhere

166
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,459
and we'll grow each year and I would

167
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,350
like to insist on this and to thank

168
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:20,920
