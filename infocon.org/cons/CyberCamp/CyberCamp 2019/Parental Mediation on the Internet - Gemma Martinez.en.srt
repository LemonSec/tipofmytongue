00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:17,789
good morning thank you very much for the

3
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:20,970
introduction first of all I would like

4
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:25,289
to think in fever for having inviting me

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,830
to be here it is an honor for me it is

6
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:32,730
actually quite imposing well as they

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:36,920
have said I am more used to academic

8
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,919
forums which are much more than they

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:56,489
research and this is one of my passions

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:01:03,989
by the way parental mediation on the

11
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:06,750
internet for Spanish we are asking us

12
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,820
today am I doing this right and this is

13
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,760
something that parents ask themselves

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:17,280
continuously especially with the arrival

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:20,640
of new technologies for mobile what is

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,979
Firenze on the mediation and this is

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:31,740
very technical but what we mean is just

18
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:36,840
the roots role the different dynamics

19
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:40,860
that create context of the family when

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,979
parents have to interview and guide the

21
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:55,490
usage of the internet for underage

22
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:55,490
children what am I going to talk about

23
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:09,758
you kids online Spain and so today I

24
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:12,849
would like to introduce the context I am

25
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:17,018
searching on what does you kids online

26
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:21,370
do in all this and what I do with

27
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:27,629
Spanish families and about the efficient

28
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:44,159
use of technologies then try to clarify

29
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:44,159
concepts between damage and priscilla

30
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,799
risk and damage especially are two

31
00:02:48,040 --> 00:03:01,090
concepts that we have to bear in mind

32
00:02:50,799 --> 00:03:02,500
when effectively unity acing many of the

33
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:12,310
news that we get from many different

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:15,340
sources and I will explain this the

35
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,849
opportunities on the internet for

36
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:22,989
underage Spanish children's be abilities

37
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:25,599
and skills they have how risks are

38
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:31,209
directly related to opportunities as

39
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:34,660
well as to abilities and skills I will

40
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,690
give a brief introduction to parental

41
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:40,209
mediation in Spain how people see in

42
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,579
Europe how we're doing it in Spain what

43
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:46,980
challenges will still need to overcome

44
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:52,349
what factors influence the use the

45
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,349
children do off the internet

46
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,929

00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:25,250
and I am supposed to be donated there

48
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,030

[Music]

52
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:43,030
it's multinational research networks

53
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:47,500
which comprises currently 33 European

54
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:51,830
countries it's being directed from

55
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:56,360
Germany and coordinated by the London

56
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:58,340
School of Economics Livingstone I

57
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,440
imagine that many of you who are

58
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,530
listening to this right now know at

59
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,340
least from hearing Sonja Livingston she

60
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:11,150
is a real reference at a global scale

61
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:20,119
when it comes to research of the usage

62
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:24,469
that the project from the Basque Country

63
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,240
a university that represented Spain we

64
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,660
are also connected with different

65
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,020
national European and international

66
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:36,889
political actors and kids online is

67
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:41,889
currently financed by better internet

68
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,889
for kids from the European Commission

69
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:52,089
the research team my university are

70
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:53,860
working very closely and we are partners

71
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:58,479
are sick

72
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:02,169
Spain project from in fevers and through

73
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:09,748
the security internet security Center is

74
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:24,209
a four and our main objective is to

75
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:28,389
improve the knowledge that we obtain and

76
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:31,049
online security of underage children

77
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,399
both European and non-european always

78
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:37,149
taken account the children's world

79
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:40,269
welfare and respecting their rights we

80
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:44,729
want to share everything we find out

81
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:48,369
with different actors political actors

82
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:52,149
all initiatives that look after

83
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:56,379
children's welfare but also in forums

84
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:59,469
such as the one today we also want to

85
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:02,349
identify and share key recommendations

86
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:08,139
to develop awareness racing initiatives

87
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:13,389
about cybersecurity and states in this

88
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:16,360
parental mediation process and this is

89
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:18,999
exactly because fear the many parents

90
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,339
and many families in Spain share when

91
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:25,269
they have to face this new challenges

92
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:26,739
they feel alone they feel that they're

93
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:31,449
the only ones they didn't know what to

94
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:33,818
do so what what can we do for you one of

95
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:39,939
the latest research that we have carried

96
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:44,150
out rental Association and we concluded

97
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:47,380
that Spanish and European families

98
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:51,590
increasing and under increasing pressure

99
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:56,690
social pressure can be measured from

100
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:58,789
very different angles and this when they

101
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,700
tried to control the usage that the

102
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,740
children do of the internet mostly due

103
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,550
to the complex processes that are

104
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:10,690
related with changing digital media

105
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:15,110
everything is very complex business

106
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:18,170
academia as the social media agent needs

107
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,810
to find a position to fire to help

108
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:24,140
families find solution and find

109
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:29,320
effective strategies so as children to

110
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,320
make the most of the interest
