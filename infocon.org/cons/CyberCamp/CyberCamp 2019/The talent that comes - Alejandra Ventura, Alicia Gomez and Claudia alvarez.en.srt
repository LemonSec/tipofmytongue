2
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:18,759
good afternoon and thank you everybody

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,019
for being here

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,689
after a long day I know it's not easy

5
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:28,630
and I'd like to thank my colleagues in

6
00:00:25,689 --> 00:00:30,460
the backstage they're the people who

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,239
people are working hard to make sure

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:36,640
that all of this works and after several

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,480
days of work it's continuing continuing

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,690
to work and functioning today I have

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:48,059
young women next to me and I'm very

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,059
excited to share the stage with them

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,710
because today they will tell us about

14
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:59,370
their experience on a personal and

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:01,210
professional level and their interest in

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,628
technologies in generally and

17
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:08,470
cybersecurity in particular on my left I

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:14,830
have Olivia Algoma comment she's in the

19
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:17,770
first year of her secondary studies and

20
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,689
she's interested in cryptography and

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:23,110
mathematics and you'll learn a bit more

22
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:27,460
about this later on she's involved in

23
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:30,000
many project stem talent girls and she

24
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:34,199
was winner of the cyber women challenges

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,659
and she has been in the lay on

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:44,710
mathematics Olympics this year we also

27
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:47,799
have Claudia Alvarez she has a master in

28
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:50,979
research from the University of Lyon and

29
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:56,560
she's a researcher in cyber security and

30
00:01:50,979 --> 00:02:00,009
she also works as a student on a PhD

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,500
working on robotics in Lyon at the

32
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:09,630
University and I'll begin with you

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:12,070
Olivia you're studying your secondary

34
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,019
education and you'd like to perhaps be

35
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,340
in

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:21,450
engineer so based on that until you get

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,100
to university and you do Computer

38
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,310
Engineering what you're going to do how

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,739
you going to prepare for that first of

40
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,250
all I need to prepare myself

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,510
appropriately and my secondary education

42
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:38,820
and in terms of education I think we

43
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:43,079
don't give an importance to computing

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:47,549
and cybersecurity and so I'm doing extra

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,480
courses and I try to make them classroom

46
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,950
based but this is not always possible

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,760
sometimes you can do courses and

48
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,769
workshops but I don't have always enough

49
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,929
time for that because of my other

50
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,740
studies at secondary school I do online

51
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:08,160
courses and I take books out from the

52
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:14,700
library and I try to attend talks and so

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:16,190
on as well as the fact that you've

54
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,989
already decided

55
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,480
Soyoung what you want to study which

56
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,170
always actually surprises me rather a

57
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,570
lot and I'm impressed by that I just

58
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,549
want to say that I did have no idea at

59
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,910
your age what I wanted to do later on in

60
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,340
life so it's nice to see how you already

61
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,459
have an idea of what you want to study

62
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,230
because that's an advantage for you and

63
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,209
you're already getting ready for that

64
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,440
and you have an idea of what's ahead of

65
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:49,020
you and that will tell you whether or

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,090
not in you're in the right place and the

67
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:57,360
fact that you know that so young it's a

68
00:03:51,090 --> 00:04:00,620
real advantage when did you start having

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,320
this interest for computing I've always

70
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:08,280
loved computing and understanding how a

71
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,859
computer works when I was young I

72
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,980
thought that it was a piece of magic

73
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,549
that there was somebody inside there

74
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,019
putting the numbers up on the screen

75
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,238
obviously as time went by I understood

76
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,469
that this was impossible there must be

77
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,729
some mathematicians and

78
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:29,400
making sure that they can do the sums

79
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:34,080
and so I decided that I wanted to study

80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:37,469
mathematics but they came a point in a

81
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,800
in a language class that I had to do a

82
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:46,050
presentation and I had to talk about a

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,690
mathematician and I thought oh I ended

84
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,090
up doing the talk and I went out of that

85
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:55,170
language class and I thought mmm I

86
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:57,539
thought this man he used computing and

87
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,490
he reached a lot of people I could use

88
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,620
maths in the world of computing and I

89
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,840
could also help a lot of people so

90
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:10,920
that's how I decided that I want to do

91
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:13,799
study computing and you Claudia your

92
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,580
computer scientists with a master in

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,570
cybersecurity and you work as a

94
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,770
researcher and the University of Lyon

95
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:25,050
and you're doing your PhD tell us a bit

96
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,680
more about that project that you're

97
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,140
working on in the University of Lyon I

98
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,460
[Music]

99
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,500
know that teensy be involved with this

100
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,130
and I have the opportunity to learn from

101
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:43,620
that and I participate in that project

102
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:45,960
from the side of in theory as say you

103
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,370
were saying we collaborate with in

104
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:53,700
thievery we at the University of Lyon

105
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:56,190
and I'm within Scylla

106
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,400
it is part of a Castilla and Leon and

107
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:05,520
from there we manage the local network

108
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:08,849
from there read Scylla is on castilla-la

109
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,120
on level and there the idea of this

110
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:14,700
project to detect threats within this

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:20,780
network the project has been running for

112
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:23,940
one year more or less and we already

113
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:27,929
have the basic ideas and we're using

114
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,770
them for research and applying learning

115
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:35,240
nigs which is all supervise which is

116
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:39,270
what we're doing most with these days I

117
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,520
know little bit about the project and

118
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,349
I've been working with the honey pods

119
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:52,469
aside so that's why you're my honey pod

120
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:55,280
go and Alethea back to you we have an

121
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,680
idea of what computer science is about

122
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,138
sometimes we have an incorrect idea of

123
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,990
it when you actually go and study it and

124
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,389
you graduate you have perhaps a

125
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,130
different idea different concept of that

126
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,810
and you change your mind about what

127
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:17,449
computer science was what attracts you

128
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:20,490
to this speciality to me come pooting

129
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:24,270
nobody can say that it's not in their

130
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,070
world from the time you wake up to when

131
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,229
you go to work or when you're listening

132
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,570
to music on your mobile when you're

133
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:33,599
commuting communicating with the people

134
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:37,669
you love your family this is your

135
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:41,719
computing and this is a very wide world

136
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:43,799
and thanks to a number of mathematic

137
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,380
calculations we've got what we've got

138
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,590
today so I just want to know what those

139
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:55,050
calculations are like I'm sure you'll

140
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:59,460
achieve that and you clothier we have

141
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:02,190
the before and the after side here tell

142
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,409
us a bit more about why you decided to

143
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,539
study this speciality what took you to

144
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:11,639
the field of computer science and and

145
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:13,740
beyond there was no particular point in

146
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,340
which I decided that I wanted to be

147
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:21,060
computer scientist it was a bit more

148
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,369
vocational I always liked computers from

149
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,470
when I was very young we just had two

150
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:30,930
computers in my school for all the

151
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:33,300
students and I always say mention one

152
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:37,440
thing and it was I think as around my

153
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:40,510
fourth fifth birthday the food bees were

154
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,560
very populated and if you remember that

155
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:45,410
perhaps they're the younger people won't

156
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:49,939
remember them so I was going to have a

157
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,589
foodie for my birthday and just before

158
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,450
that I said no I don't want that one to

159
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,680
computer my parents said hello what's

160
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,110
going on here and I said no I definitely

161
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,019
want a computer so they gave me a little

162
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,610
interactive computer and it was just a

163
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:05,089
little bit for about learning for doing

164
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:08,300
adding up and taking away and right from

165
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:11,029
a young age I started using a pewter

166
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,990
keyboard and that's how it started and

167
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:20,329
then in secondary school a teacher

168
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:23,300
organised a trip here to Valencia so

169
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:27,079
I've got background with Valencia and we

170
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:33,229
went to the University in cast they on

171
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:35,660
and I was shown a few things like the

172
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,190
now that many people know and I thought

173
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:43,910
wow this is incredible how do these

174
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,370
little robots can move like that and

175
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,910
then a little bit later on I already

176
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:52,250
knew I wanted to do computer science

177
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:54,319
then I went to the University of Leon

178
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,270
and I visited a group there in the

179
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:02,240
university and I saw those robots once

180
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:05,020
again and once again I thought wow so I

181
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,720
started my degree in computer science

182
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:11,990
Computer Engineering and I knew I wanted

183
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,640
to end up working with robotics because

184
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:18,620
I was in a robotics group in the

185
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,689
university but I didn't know that

186
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,380
students could collaborate in this group

187
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:28,490
at the time and then I was lucky enough

188
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,260
in the third year of my course and to

189
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,899
receive an invitation to offer

190
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,750
participation in a group for robotics

191
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:38,209
and I said yes of course and this has

192
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:41,630
been my link with the robotics group and

193
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:45,109
I'm doing my PhD on this now and then

194
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:48,380
there's also cyber security so

195
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:51,790
throughout my degree in computer

196
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:53,180
engineering I went to things like

197
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,449
Cybercom

198
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:59,089
Oh Andes many of them are organized by

199
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:01,430
in thievery and I was all interested in

200
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:06,080
cybersecurity and I thought it was an

201
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:08,569
interesting field and it seemed that it

202
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,140
would have a lot of future and that

203
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,900
everybody was talking about it

204
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,180
so I finished my degree I did my

205
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,949
master's course in cybersecurity and I

206
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,250
just finished it this year and Here I am

207
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,250
today

208
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:28,630
Alysia you're in the stem talent girls

209
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:32,740
and I have been told a little something

210
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:36,710
I'm her mentor actually in the program

211
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:39,110
so tell me a bit about this program and

212
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,330
the support that you're giving on a

213
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,090
personal level under a professional

214
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:48,290
level for the future stem talent girls

215
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:51,380
is the need that companies have for

216
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,930
future employees and the realization

217
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:56,060
that there are a few women in this field

218
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,870
so in the program they attempt to

219
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:06,349
inspire us and couragous to go into the

220
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:09,620
stem degree area we are given talks and

221
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:12,800
by women who have been successful in

222
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:16,010
this field those talks are up available

223
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,790
on YouTube and you are told a little bit

224
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:23,060
about the life the life of these women

225
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,589
these moments and these challenges that

226
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,660
these women have had and you come out do

227
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:30,800
you think of this lady could do it I can

228
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:34,540
do it too also we go to businesses we do

229
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:38,060
workshops we did one on HTML last year

230
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,709
to get into the world of web pages and

231
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,099
we can also continue with that training

232
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:46,400
by ourselves and source about having

233
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,340
references in the fields right and of

234
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:53,630
course you Claudia tell us a little bit

235
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:56,330
about your pressure professional

236
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:59,450
references in the field somebody that

237
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:03,080
might has might have influenced you to

238
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:06,110
reach your goals or helped you to know

239
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:10,580
where you want to go professionally

240
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:12,500
their person I look up to now I don't

241
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:18,440
know if she'll be here she'll be

242
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:22,640
listening to me and this gentleman is an

243
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,730
amazing guy his name is Vicente and he

244
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,860
knows everything about the world of

245
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,950
computing and I've been working with him

246
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,230
day-to-day he's responsible for the

247
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,600
project that I'm working on within CV

248
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:39,170
and he's one of the three directors of

249
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,350
my PhD there are many many spectacular

250
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:48,290
people but in particular of Ethan this

251
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:54,529
inspired me I don't know if he's here in

252
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:56,269
Sniper cam it's very exciting to have

253
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:59,360
both of you here today because I

254
00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:01,279
involved and working or have a

255
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,329
relationship with both of you on a

256
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,070
professional level I shouldn't say I

257
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,120
have a personal relationship because I'm

258
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:11,450
your mentor but we certainly have a

259
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,459
professional one you want to study

260
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,800
computing and you're interested in

261
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,149
cybersecurity and we're going to have a

262
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:24,260
look at something that you've already

263
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:27,020
achieved in this field so tell us a

264
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,029
little bit about we're talking about

265
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,720
cybersecurity what comes to your mind

266
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:35,510
what do you imagine

267
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,160
well I picture like a police agency

268
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,740
because I have to all someone who's an

269
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,870
expert in cybersecurity works really

270
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,579
closely or just something very similar

271
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,520
to what policemen could do because when

272
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:48,500
we're walking down the streets we are

273
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,540
not in fear of being attacked but we can

274
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,570
feel safe rather because we have

275
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,699
policemen around us and on the internet

276
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,800
we have cybersecurity experts who are

277
00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:03,079
looking after our securities we

278
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:05,959
shouldn't be afraid of getting hijacked

279
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:08,269
or anything so you've got a telephone

280
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,729
number to call helpline in people's

281
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:13,149
helpline for example right I like that

282
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,149
vision

283
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:21,750
and do you see yourself in a few years

284
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:25,109
doing something related to cybersecurity

285
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,750
in particular or do you think that is

286
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,660
something which is still too far away

287
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,629
well I think this is a bit too far away

288
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,490
because I'm still doing my secondary

289
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:38,670
studies but I definitely want to study

290
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,370
something related to computing and to

291
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:43,740
cyber security because it's what really

292
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,589
interests me because right now I'm not

293
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,329
studying something for my future because

294
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:52,980
I want to do this or that but basically

295
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:55,138
rather I am curious I want to learn and

296
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,509
and I want to learn more about computing

297
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:59,220
and cybersecurity suicide well I do get

298
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:01,110
an idea that on my end of doing

299
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,689
something related to that but it's still

300
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:08,399
too far away yeah the important thing is

301
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:14,040
for that curiosity to never die klaudia

302
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:17,879
you we can say you are working in cyber

303
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:21,449
security have you found any handicaps

304
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:24,380
any obstacles during your career do you

305
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:27,660
think you will find any in the future

306
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:32,029
well getting to where I am now hasn't

307
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:35,100
been an easy job because I have had to

308
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:37,110
give up many things in my life I have

309
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,120
had to give up going out with my friends

310
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,130
for example because I had to stay at

311
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,259
home and study because at the end of the

312
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,470
day you have to work hard if you want to

313
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:50,100
achieve something so I haven't really

314
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,139
found obstacles really but it has been

315
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,959
really different difficult to get to

316
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:59,300
where I am right now also because I come

317
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:03,449
from very humble family most of my

318
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:08,188
family have always worked in farming and

319
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:10,829
you know I have actually only got a

320
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:12,829
grant one year that I have very good

321
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:17,220
grades but and that is because when

322
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:18,480
choosing who gets the grants people who

323
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,449
work in farming

324
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,770
have them most points unfortunately so

325
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:28,650
the only way I could actually pay the

326
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,860
tuition fees at university was by

327
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,690
getting honest I had a few you obviously

328
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,199
know everything but in that way I

329
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:39,630
managed to make my parents pay less

330
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,250
tuition fees it's true that my parents

331
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,340
never really put any pressure on me

332
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,440
saying all you have to pass everything

333
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,540
they said well if if you have to do

334
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,179
something twice then you will have to do

335
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,850
we'll do whatever we can to be able to

336
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,799
afford your tuition fees but yeah it's

337
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,889
been it's been hard to get to where I am

338
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:00,900
right now and about the future well I'm

339
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:04,460
sure that there will be obstacles and

340
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:07,559
issues but a few years ago I attended a

341
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,200
talk I can't even remember where or who

342
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:13,020
gave that talk but I did draw a

343
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,750
conclusion there are two people those

344
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,000
who find three problems to every

345
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,090
solution and those who find three

346
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,400
solutions to every problem I think I am

347
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,980
in the second group because no matter

348
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,980
how many problems life has put in front

349
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,090
of me I have always tried to solve them

350
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:37,380
and I think that's what everyone should

351
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:39,689
do on that line I think it's very

352
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,200
important that earlier on in life but

353
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:45,710
also during mitosis the the support that

354
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,150
we get from families from our friends in

355
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,370
the decisions that we're going to make

356
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,570
and everything that we have decided and

357
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:56,760
really on the path that we are actually

358
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:59,159
walking and Claudia in that sense

359
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,720
concerning support and motivation I see

360
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,419
that you have enough motivation yourself

361
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,190
but do you feel that your friends and

362
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:09,480
family have supported to you but they

363
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:12,840
keep encouraging you to fulfill your

364
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,080
dream no yeah of course

365
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,879
both my partner my parents and my

366
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,820
brother trust me even more than I trust

367
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,710
myself so I do get a lot of support from

368
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,050
them and also of course with my friends

369
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,280
I've always been big deep

370
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:31,129
of my grave the one who likes computers

371
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,260
but I have always had a lot of support

372
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:37,520
and I would like to thank them and

373
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:40,730
everyone who has supported me for that I

374
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,020
think I'm very lucky to have them always

375
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:48,290
near me and always support my decisions

376
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:50,090
and Alethea how about you it's exactly

377
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,879
the same for me or my loved ones have

378
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,649
trusted me much more always than I have

379
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,140
trusted myself and I think everything I

380
00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,290
have achieved is thanks to all their

381
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:03,260
support because behind every challenge

382
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,270
every competition I sometimes I feel

383
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,560
where I shouldn't go maybe I won't be

384
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:10,790
able to do it and they've always said

385
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:14,510
just go and try always encouraging me

386
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:16,159
not to give up in every project and I

387
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:19,280
think everything I've achieved has been

388
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,160
thanks to all these people so now you're

389
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,600
to do and your homework is to trust

390
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,110
yourselves because everyone else trusts

391
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,719
you

392
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:33,260
so this is your homework from here might

393
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:36,500
not know these two girls participated in

394
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,240
cyber woman challenge the first one that

395
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,790
took place in Spain and they actually

396
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,890
won Alethea won and she doesn't even

397
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,810
work in cybersecurity and she doesn't

398
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,600
know this she says so that she wants to

399
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,760
work in cybersecurity and I think that

400
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,100
in that sense could she tell us about

401
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,540
the experience a little bit could you

402
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,320
tell us what the competition was about

403
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,200
how you felt well when I signed up I was

404
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,750
really excited but when the day arrived

405
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,280
the competition was in the afternoon the

406
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,050
morning I went to class and I was really

407
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,030
raised to sound I said no I'm not going

408
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:10,370
they said no you have to go you've

409
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,889
signed up you've told everyone you going

410
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:18,290
you should go you didn't do well then

411
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:22,210
you just go home and in the end I did go

412
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:25,360
there I felt really really welcome

413
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:31,630
was very warm they were welcomed us very

414
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:35,649
well and the competition we used a

415
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:39,970
different tools from micro train and we

416
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:42,600
were told how it worked we had different

417
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,600
challenges

418
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:50,020
if for example a file has been deleted

419
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:51,640
someone in the in the company has

420
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,290
deleted this file can you find it and

421
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,420
all that sort of problems really they

422
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,629
used to find in real at a corporate

423
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,790
environment so I went there completely

424
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,670
inexperienced I had only read something

425
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,470
from a book and I came out with a really

426
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:10,030
really good experience and of course

427
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:13,000
where the Taliban won and I had a lot of

428
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:15,610
fun so everyone if you find this

429
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,850
opportunity I encourage you to go just

430
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:22,209
go go and give it a try because you will

431
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,639
gain experience even if you didn't win a

432
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:27,490
prize so the worst that can happen is to

433
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:34,560
learn isn't it and how did how about you

434
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:37,720
how what was it like for you well

435
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,419
because this was going to happen in Iran

436
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,990
I decided to go and try give it a try I

437
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:46,570
wanted to live the experience it was a

438
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:50,080
very comforting experience I met three

439
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,639
wonderful girls and we got on really

440
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,720
really well we hit it off from the

441
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,420
beginning we started doing all the

442
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,160
challenges we were runners-up and I'm

443
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,750
really really happy to have taken place

444
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,700
and soon you will be taking part and

445
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,930
city yet in cyber camp how do you feel

446
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:13,870
about that well I think all these people

447
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:18,820
are really really good and they have

448
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:22,239
been preparing for a whole year and they

449
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:25,990
are almost devoted to this and I hope

450
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,760
that one day I will be able to to do

451
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,710
this as well but I can not do it because

452
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,390
I've got a lot of work I've got my

453
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,460
PhD so I don't have really that much

454
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:37,360
time but well I just want to go have fun

455
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:47,169
and learn as much as I can yeah that is

456
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:48,668
the attitude just finish what do you do

457
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:51,510
in your free time other than learning

458
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:56,549
and everything what else do you do

459
00:23:51,510 --> 00:24:00,100
well obviously is related to computing I

460
00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:02,200
just give myself challenges I challenge

461
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,389
myself I say for example oh something's

462
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,890
been done with Arduino and I just say

463
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,529
well I want to do this as well this is

464
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:10,690
what happened to me this summer I bought

465
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:13,450
an Arduino plate I bought some

466
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,010
components and I studied putting it

467
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,080
together I had never done that in class

468
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,500
because we are no luckier enough to have

469
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,139
that at school so I just started

470
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,039
watching YouTube videos I took books

471
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,870
from the library

472
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:30,760
and I finally did it now I'm it is there

473
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,928
it's not that I play with the robot now

474
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,850
but my challenge was to manage to do it

475
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:42,340
and just to finish and this is for both

476
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:45,428
of you could you just send a message to

477
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:49,750
all those girls and boys young people

478
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:53,409
who are curious at least curious about

479
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,600
computing and cyber security anything

480
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:57,340
what would you say well if you're

481
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,980
curious about it the best thing you can

482
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:02,770
do is to lend you might then learn and

483
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,620
say well actually I don't like this but

484
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:08,740
then you can do something else but if it

485
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,739
really interests you then it is better

486
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,559
to do something that you curious about

487
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,029
then something that is almost compulsory

488
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,440
something they have to do because you

489
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:20,980
have to do it because if you learned

490
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,870
because you're curious then you will get

491
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,549
a lot of concepts and learn a lot

492
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:28,620
without even realizing you're learning

493
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:31,480
so I would encourage you to look for

494
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:34,360
different courses and sign up for

495
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,350
everything talks like for example cyber

496
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,789
cam

497
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:42,699
and otherwise just check online courses

498
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:45,220
and talks which talks on the internet we

499
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,410
have a very very broad world on the

500
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:51,539
Internet and you can use that if you're

501
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,539
not lucky enough to do that in your city

502
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:57,580
Claudia

503
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:01,899
seems to be no obstacles here to

504
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:06,129
knowledge before making a decision in

505
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,960
Iran you do have a lot of resources so

506
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,450
you actually get to know the things

507
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:14,590
you're curious about and decide or

508
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:16,390
decide not to because at the end of day

509
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,918
if you didn't like technology well know

510
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,679
how I'm done you might like something

511
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,870
else and you already have the knowledge

512
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:28,480
and how about you Claudia what would you

513
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:32,168
like to say well I would like to

514
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:37,270
encourage everyone because the path

515
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:40,990
might be hard but every effort has its

516
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:45,220
price and if you like this world just go

517
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:47,320
ahead and I have a quote on Twitter if

518
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,659
you want to be good about something but

519
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,689
first of all you have to be able to be

520
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:55,659
bad on it so you have to be ready to

521
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,900
fail because no one is born knowing

522
00:26:55,659 --> 00:27:02,070
things you have to go to every event you

523
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:05,679
have to go to every Congress just never

524
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:07,510
stop asking questions there are no silly

525
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,030
questions always ask any questions you

526
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,740
might have in these events people are

527
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:16,299
always wonderful they will always answer

528
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:18,780
your questions and of course I would

529
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:21,908
like to tell you not to fear failure

530
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:25,120
because we seem to think in the society

531
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:28,720
that failure is bad but no we have to

532
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,408
normalize failure because what matters

533
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,909
if that you try if you fail well no harm

534
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:36,490
done you have to try again you can

535
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:38,590
always learn something from failure and

536
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:43,120
you have to learn to get something good

537
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,159
from failure yeah in the end he always

538
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,219
learn something

539
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,680
whether you are successful or not now

540
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,570
we're talking about the future talent in

541
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,040
this round table by I think it's the

542
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,810
talent that we already have thank you

543
