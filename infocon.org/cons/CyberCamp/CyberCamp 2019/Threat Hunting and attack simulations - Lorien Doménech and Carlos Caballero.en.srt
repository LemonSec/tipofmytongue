2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,838
good afternoon thank you for being here

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,619
in to send us a very difficult time of

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,810
the day here in cyber camp and I

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,869
understand that if there's a lot of

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,038
information going around in your head so

7
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,970
we hope we have an interesting

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,308
presentation for you that you enjoy it

9
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:38,100
and we'd like you to get a number of

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:41,699
resources and ideas from this everything

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,890
that we have been working on has been

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,510
done over time there's a question of

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,020
downloading everything and then putting

14
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,839
it into practice so this is the index

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,050
that we have for today we'll have an

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,660
introduction to threat hunting what we

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:02,760
do in this field of work what he'll give

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:05,789
you the basis we'll talk about some

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,960
cases over cyber criminals and I think

20
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,670
that Steve about presentation in terms

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,860
of the environments that we have in

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:20,340
threaten team will also do a bit of

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:22,560
attack simulation and then we'll reflect

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,430
on all the work that we've done today

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,970
with some case studies and a playbook at

26
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,500
the end conclusions and some resources

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,689
that I think are very important this in

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,829
this field of work and that will bring

29
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:36,829
us to the end of the presentation

30
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:46,409
already introduce us but I'm at a loss

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,100
when he was responsible for forensics an

32
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,799
area of cyber security and I was looking

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:59,219
for somebody to help me in my day-to-day

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,719
work I found a number of people that was

35
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:05,789
interested in but he was the youngest of

36
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:08,098
them I think you were 17 and we got on

37
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,649
very well here a great CV and we've

38
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,390
worked really well together

39
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:12,959
thank you very much florian we work

40
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,839
together

41
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:21,359
he is currently working in Indra and he

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,810
works in response to incidents and

43
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:33,000
pretending we collaborate with cyber

44
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:43,980
corporates and we work in and out of

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:48,389
betrayed I need you to copy the QR with

46
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:53,040
your mobile or copy that code and answer

47
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:56,189
this interactive four question so get

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,819
your Mobile's output on the QR detector

49
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:06,650
and soon we'll see the results you can

50
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:11,939
do it on the QR or via the web I think

51
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:14,930
so we can use this information to adapt

52
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,970
the workshop a little bit to our needs

53
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:21,659
so the graph is coming up and now we

54
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,280
have already three participants people

55
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,370
can even do it at home everybody can get

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,189
involved yes it's just a question of

57
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:36,810
going to the link and using that if you

58
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:40,680
haven't got a QR code scanner we want to

59
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:45,090
adapt the workshop accordingly to see if

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,590
we're going to Mordor or not although

61
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,449
we've actually only got a couple of

62
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:53,939
hours to work with we'll see what we can

63
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:56,609
manage it would seem that the direct

64
00:03:53,939 --> 00:04:02,250
results say that people do have an

65
00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:03,720
understanding of this field we had the

66
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,310
idea that perhaps people wouldn't know

67
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:11,549
so much about threatening but it looks

68
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:13,919
pretty good I think we can leave this

69
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:19,798
information here for the moment and move

70
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:22,260
on to the next slide let's go to the

71
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,099
basis the background it's important for

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,659
you to understand about threatened

73
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:33,990
background information so we have the

74
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:37,480
lifecycle for a cyber security client

75
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,600
and this is essential for this work of

76
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:43,530
great Henry hunting it's important to

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,140
understand all the stages of an incident

78
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:50,349
so professionals get involved in this

79
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,860
field it requires a number of skills

80
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:58,000
from various professions the most

81
00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:03,010
offensive side with the skills you might

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,710
have then the administrator the system

83
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,830
administrator side somebody who decides

84
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,900
understands how things work internally

85
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,539
where through Windows or Linux and so on

86
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,489
this is an important part for analysts

87
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,670
the person who responds and then

88
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:22,630
forensics we are in the part of

89
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:26,830
forensics we respond to a number of

90
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:29,620
incidents and offensive part is the most

91
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,450
difficult part we've done a number of

92
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:37,510
workshops for that and we'll have a look

93
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:42,820
at that in a moment this is the hardest

94
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:49,300
bit of all image gives us an idea of

95
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:52,360
their full cycle in terms of threats so

96
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:56,560
it's not with a hunting heart and we'll

97
00:05:52,360 --> 00:06:00,820
create a number of hypotheses we might

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,630
call this be the covering or the the

99
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:08,050
criminal behind the threat and the

100
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,300
infrastructure of the attack and we're

101
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,240
going to do a little bit of

102
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,790
investigation what do these cyber

103
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,990
criminals use what software do they have

104
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:24,060
what techniques and what tactics

105
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:28,600
we'll find out about the organization

106
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:32,140
client and then we'll increment in get

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,990
further into the process so we've done

108
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,039
one part and we have a result on which

109
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,809
we cannot continue improving

110
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,449
whatever must through the different

111
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:45,409
stages that we will see later on and

112
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:48,169
then we move on to the next level and

113
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:52,909
the next level is something that gives

114
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:55,270
us the basis of the use if this happens

115
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:57,349
and somebody attacks me if cyber

116
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,039
criminal attacks me I need to have a

117
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:04,878
system that alerts me of that that is

118
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:08,119
the last stage we'll have a look at the

119
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:10,960
cases of use and how it is implemented

120
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:15,620
and that would be the full lifecycle

121
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,219
there we have it then so let's move on

122
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:23,689
to the next slide this is very important

123
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:25,669
in cyber security people tend to take

124
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:29,360
their own journey and don't share their

125
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:34,058
journey and you will have heard a lot

126
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:37,759
about standards but that's the way it is

127
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:41,719
to do threaten ting we believe that it's

128
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:45,080
important to talk about Mugler young

129
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:50,709
cases of use and tight eating

130
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:54,080
methodology this would be the famous

131
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:58,339
pyramid of threat hunting what is the

132
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,649
basis of this you will have heard about

133
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:02,719
this in sniper camp because that have

134
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:04,430
been forensics have explained this these

135
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:10,330
are the techniques the procedures and

136
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,330
the methodology so here we have the

137
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:20,089
there are a number of artifacts that are

138
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:21,620
very difficult to find as well the rest

139
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:27,259
of the elements have perhaps a bit more

140
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:32,089
trivial so there's more emphasis on the

141
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:33,919
first three parts in the time so on the

142
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,699
right hand side then you have all of the

143
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,370
different phases this is all very well

144
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:41,958
documented and we'll see it over the

145
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,720
coming slides and it will be a little

146
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:47,180
bit different we'll have the initial

147
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,079
phase and the second phase of the hunt

148
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,079
and then the final phase

149
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,480
I forgot to mention that it's very

150
00:08:52,699 --> 00:09:01,429
important to have a knowledge of the

151
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,740
clients infrastructure often in threat

152
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:06,769
hunting we can be working with just one

153
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:10,129
business or with several businesses and

154
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:13,429
it's important to have the knowledge of

155
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:15,589
the infrastructure in that company there

156
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:17,209
are many that are very very big and it's

157
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:19,600
very difficult to understand their

158
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:23,089
infrastructure and that's understandable

159
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:27,110
a basic idea of how the infrastructure

160
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:28,429
is established is important very often

161
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,949
you'll might come across companies that

162
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:33,949
don't actually have a s infrastructure

163
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:39,439
obviously in the day-to-day it's very

164
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:42,649
difficult it can bet quite a bit more

165
00:09:39,439 --> 00:09:51,319
complicated depending on the on the

166
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:52,929
degree of complexity there is a link as

167
00:09:51,319 --> 00:10:00,079
you can see and it will take us to in

168
00:09:52,929 --> 00:10:03,290
Excel and I suggest that you download it

169
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:06,079
and you will see it's really quite

170
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,118
useful because it shows you the at the

171
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:12,019
top there you can see it there are

172
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:15,170
different levels and proposals that you

173
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:17,660
can use for threatened team we can use

174
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,410
them we can change them we can add more

175
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:25,100
and start working this is just like a

176
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:33,469
basis to have some indicators of how to

177
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:35,929
work in threat hunting methodologies and

178
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:39,589
a number of tactics on which we have

179
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:46,579
worked over the months and we can flip

180
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:49,449
them here other resources that you can

181
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:52,429
have and we could talk a lot about these

182
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:55,189
but we just put the ones in here that we

183
00:10:52,429 --> 00:11:02,029
have used Sigma I'm sure you're familiar

184
00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:03,740
with that anybody couple of people I

185
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:11,360
really recommend it

186
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:19,220
to an excellent project and it aims to

187
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:22,340
set a standard for configuration very

188
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:26,630
sims and it gives you cases and rules

189
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:30,950
that you need to to follow an auditor to

190
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:37,640
work with that you can turn them into

191
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:43,190
different term opportunities it's this

192
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:45,650
kind of a google translate in a way some

193
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:50,500
of them aren't too great some a little

194
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:52,939
bit too general but this is our work as

195
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:59,810
analyzers and to implement this into our

196
00:11:52,940 --> 00:12:04,910
system going to talk about 80 and seek'

197
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:12,069
and other applications for virtual

198
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:12,069
environments so let's continue where we

199
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:19,340
are analyzing when we're analyzing Spain

200
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:28,670
we can see that there are a number of

201
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:31,370
attacks it's s motet and a number of

202
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,410
different attacks that have been

203
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,440
suffered in different groups in Spain

204
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,130
and this give us an idea of how they

205
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,920
work

206
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,220
what's the techniques what's their

207
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:50,900
background how do they work and for that

208
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:53,480
we use a miter in our workshop here

209
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:59,480
today we're going to try and get all the

210
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:01,330
knowledge that is available out there so

211
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,680
you've seen this before it's very

212
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:08,360
comprehensive it's got the preheat act

213
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,760
section on the left it also covers the

214
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,630
part of cloud and there's also a mobile

215
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,730
section

216
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:20,790
there's also a navigator there URL that

217
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:25,830
you have there and you can use that to

218
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:29,099
see how a group can work so we select it

219
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:33,660
and you can continue looking at that and

220
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:39,120
we'll see that in our lab session and

221
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:42,360
this is an example of group we have

222
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,610
Lazarus anybody familiar with that

223
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,170
they've been working for a long time

224
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:51,350
anybody know what the origin of that

225
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:55,370
group is it's quite difficult isn't it

226
00:13:51,350 --> 00:14:01,760
people say that they could be from the

227
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:05,280
north you can see the i dint efficacious

228
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,760
much offers an an ID eater for that

229
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:11,300
identification but it also says they

230
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,490
have been given many different names

231
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,709
there's indications of where they think

232
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,260
they're from what is their background

233
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:22,560
which is very very complex actually

234
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:25,710
quite famous for the attack they did on

235
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:33,510
Sony anybody familiar with that attack

236
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:38,310
that that they don't Sony yeah it was

237
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:40,950
kind of a revenge I talked about that

238
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:43,319
about a year ago a year ago when I gave

239
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,490
a talk on that and you can find

240
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,290
information about that

241
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,790
it's really quite comprehensive you can

242
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,010
see all the kind of tools that they use

243
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,719
how they work and you just have to go on

244
00:14:53,010 --> 00:15:04,830
there click on there and miter and you

245
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:08,880
get all of that I should also say about

246
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:15,089
the security tools that they're taking

247
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:20,070
on this framework this is a an example

248
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:23,850
of sandbox which is very famous so this

249
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,610
is a malignant software and the results

250
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,800
that it gives you

251
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:31,839
using mitre we can go to one of the

252
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,680
areas that were interested interested in

253
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,040
and click on it

254
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,599
and then we can analyze where it's from

255
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:43,510
but we have all this in a single

256
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:50,230
viewpoint and that's really quite

257
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:53,470
helpful so let's talk about the

258
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:59,170
different environments that we have to

259
00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:04,390
start off with first one is detection

260
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:09,040
lab it's a set of machines and they have

261
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:11,790
a small business infrastructure what

262
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:17,760
does it contain well all of these

263
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:21,310
applications can be query letter scripts

264
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,860
is Magne for example we'll talk a bit

265
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:29,439
more about this later on what it's what

266
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:31,920
is it used for and how it helps us when

267
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,670
we're collecting all the information and

268
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:40,510
filtering events particular on Windows

269
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:45,819
and the transcript will help us to

270
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:47,529
register all the movements there is a

271
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,570
number of other applications that we'll

272
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:54,360
see later on these are some of the

273
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:56,980
technical requirements for detection lab

274
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:02,290
you can see that and github and you can

275
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:05,079
download it the requirements that it

276
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:09,149
calls for air up on there we need to

277
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:13,720
have a packer and grant we have used

278
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:19,150
VirtualBox it can be done with VMware or

279
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:23,260
AWS and we need to substitute background

280
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:27,150
for terraforming but that's a completely

281
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:31,150
different presentation for another day

282
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:33,220
so this is the description of what every

283
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:41,710
machine

284
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:45,019
we have the server all of these machines

285
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:50,619
collect information and sent is sent

286
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:52,879
through the client will see a demo now

287
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:56,678
about the infrastructure how we

288
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:56,678
administer our infrastructure and so on

289
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:08,440
we have all the machines here the logger

290
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:11,408
logger and the directory and so on so

291
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:17,409
all this environment

292
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:19,970
thanks to Apaches welcome all helps us

293
00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:23,629
administer the machines through our

294
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:28,210
computer and it is quite useful to

295
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:34,850
access machines from the same place

296
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:37,369
groggy animals but now as you can see

297
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,469
here we've got several machines and

298
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:45,799
we're going to get into Windows 10

299
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:49,940
clients are about people and what we're

300
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:53,450
going to do is we're going to launch an

301
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,509
attack with um a great team which this

302
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,309
laboratory installs so we can simulate

303
00:18:55,509 --> 00:19:02,090
the attacks through PowerShell in this

304
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:05,049
case once we open PowerShell we're doing

305
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:07,539
it with admin privileges so that we can

306
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:11,499
launch as many attacks as possible

307
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:17,539
because some attacks need this kind of

308
00:19:11,499 --> 00:19:20,809
privileges so whilst this is we're going

309
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:22,820
to open D of the machine against which

310
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,999
we're going to launch another attack in

311
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,658
this case with power exploit because at

312
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:34,519
the end the day our objective is to fill

313
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:36,799
those infected logs and then we're going

314
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:39,049
to get through the smoke configuration

315
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,080
to launch an attack and make some noise

316
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:47,740
so we can then see exactly what happened

317
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:52,289
now let's go on to the route where our

318
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,289
tool is atomic red team

319
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:20,720
so we move on to the tactic that we want

320
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:23,270
to apply mr. guys I was a live another

321
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:30,170
lawyer in this case we have selected

322
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:33,160
execution which is t 1086 the one from

323
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,690
PowerShell which we really really like

324
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,850
and then we're going to be able to

325
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:42,380
fiddle a little bit with it and do our

326
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:44,959
play so it's as easy it's easy as just

327
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:50,030
launching that script letting it execute

328
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,920
and some processes but it does act on in

329
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,970
the background so in a few seconds it's

330
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,940
going to tell us that it's going to

331
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:59,390
close as you can see now and through the

332
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,760
task manager we can see that PowerShell

333
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,380
is actually working on the background so

334
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,879
you can see here it shows that it's

335
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,970
making a lot of noise but little by

336
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,640
little it's going to start advancing and

337
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:14,030
in the end is going to give us an output

338
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,700
if it's being able to do it properly now

339
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:18,560
we're going to do the same procedure in

340
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:27,710
this case instead of atomic red team

341
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:29,389
we're going to use power explore it I'm

342
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,350
going to zoom in a little bit because I

343
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,350
don't know if you can see it properly

344
00:21:51,190 --> 00:22:03,340
so we launched one of the tests the

345
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:08,000
first one code execution was yucky

346
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:10,760
in this case you can see that it keeps

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,020
showing us the calculator several

348
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:16,460
calculator H is also notepads and we're

349
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:21,710
going to let it work because it takes

350
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:24,230
some time as I was saying a three meter

351
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:33,740
speed and now let's look into what the

352
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:36,290
first script on Windows 10 is doing so

353
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,270
it's going to run 14 tests one by one

354
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:40,970
you can see them here this was atomic

355
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:43,760
yeah the one was launched for Windows 10

356
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:48,770
the first one we launched so you can see

357
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,720
here all the tests that it has now if

358
00:22:48,770 --> 00:23:00,889
you look at the commands which I here at

359
00:22:50,720 --> 00:23:07,100
the there's a variable URL which is the

360
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:10,310
one it's referencing to at the top in

361
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:12,340
this case it's on github so it downloads

362
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:15,620
it from there and then it's executing

363
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:19,699
some of the tests require for it to

364
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:21,520
download files that are on github so you

365
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,630
can see there are different ones here

366
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,100
and this one for example is creating

367
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:32,030
users with its description with

368
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,010
permissions with name everything and you

369
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:38,180
can see all the other tests that it's

370
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:41,480
snowin change and we will see afterwards

371
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,220
if everything the worth launch is really

372
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,430
returning the locks that we're looking

373
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,430
for

374
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,460
now have how have we created this

375
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,090
infrastructure because this

376
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,670
infrastructure is not just about

377
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:58,879
pressing a button and looking at work

378
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:01,530
only a part of it is so I'm going to

379
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,630
tell you which failures we've obtained

380
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:07,290
and how to solve them because we've done

381
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:09,470
this a few times I've got almost one

382
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:12,659
terabyte of hard drive with two or three

383
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:15,150
installations of this lab whilst testing

384
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,990
it to see all the fail failures that we

385
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:20,820
were getting because our objective at

386
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,810
the end of the day is to show you our

387
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:28,889
experience this is a great lab but we

388
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:30,659
have found different issues and with

389
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:33,470
solve them so we want to show them what

390
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,780
to use that you can do this at home so

391
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:41,340
we have downloaded them get where the

392
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:47,520
repository and we've just follow the

393
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:50,310
steps we now execute the script and I'll

394
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,850
show you how we do it and what command

395
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:57,389
we have to give it before that to be

396
00:24:53,850 --> 00:25:00,389
executed as quickly as possible and the

397
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,980
issue we have found here because it

398
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:09,510
works when you download it's that's

399
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:11,550
building all those machines but when it

400
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:15,690
is getting on to the last machine which

401
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:17,460
is Windows 10 we find an issue it says

402
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,720
that it has been successfully completed

403
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,470
but that machine has not been created

404
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:28,560
now what do we do here what we do is we

405
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:32,010
commend a few lines 207 to 214 in this

406
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,470
case and these show us whether the

407
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:38,390
machine has been created so that if we

408
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:41,010
by mistake execute this command again

409
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,810
then it will tell us that the machines

410
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:46,020
have already been created so this is

411
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:49,050
basically checking if there's already a

412
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:51,300
machine and so with this we cancel the

413
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:53,310
script but it checks that all the

414
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,379
machines are there and then it will

415
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:58,980
realize the window since it's not there

416
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:04,800
and then it will create so by commenting

417
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:07,920
lies we solve that issue now as you can

418
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,200
see here we've got the description of

419
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,770
all those machines that obviously need

420
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,990
some resources so with this file here

421
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,420
we have all the configuration we see

422
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:20,490
everything we see where the ioss are

423
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,710
going to be downloaded the images of the

424
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,650
virtual machine the name that is going

425
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:30,240
to assign to it the characteristics and

426
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:36,390
features and once the machine has been

427
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:40,800
lifted it will give it a script which is

428
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:44,040
going to create the system install all

429
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:51,240
the applications that we're going to

430
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:56,460
need to do our threat hunt so let's see

431
00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:06,240
the results now see if they're done was

432
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:08,670
you can see here there's some noise as

433
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,990
you can see here Windows 10 atomic rip

434
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:16,050
team the process has been successfully

435
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:18,059
completed and little by little we're

436
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:22,050
going to start getting these message

437
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:25,889
it's obviously there anyway let's go on

438
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:29,159
to s plan and let's see what we've got

439
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:36,150
here and how we can treat all that

440
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:37,890
information we've got a span enterprise

441
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:45,720
which is a demo version you can all

442
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:48,150
guess it if you want it these machines

443
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:58,679
give you license for free and everything

444
00:27:48,150 --> 00:28:01,440
this is s plunk by the folks we didn't

445
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:05,130
have the threat hunting threat hunting

446
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,400
module but this application does have it

447
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:12,750
and this is a very good application it's

448
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:15,540
very visual because of the graphics and

449
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,330
the way it represents data and you will

450
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:22,168
be able to see it as soon as this is

451
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:25,050
loaded you'll see the movements and even

452
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:25,380
the tactics that have been used as well

453
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:29,760
as

454
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,679
techniques on the side as well as the

455
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:38,070
number of times that these have been

456
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:44,299
executed bangle we can always set reign

457
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:44,299
and decide which range we want to use

458
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:54,479
and if we go on my sack of rich we can

459
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:58,700
see the number of times that these

460
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:01,380
actions have been executed and a graph

461
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,289
which is the same one that Lorien showed

462
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:07,289
us earlier yes you can see the matching

463
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:09,690
with myself little counting off

464
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:12,809
everything that has been created on this

465
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:16,130
lap yeah we've been working along with

466
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:18,480
it this week now so this is one of the

467
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:21,240
searches and browsers that I really like

468
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,669
because it allows us to filter by a

469
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:31,020
technique and we can also exclude hosts

470
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:36,409
for example and let's just input our

471
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,408
technique which is T 1086

472
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:50,880
so once we load if the data have loaded

473
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,740
properly then we get all the information

474
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:58,740
as output you can see that there are

475
00:29:52,740 --> 00:30:00,390
several pages and from here you you see

476
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,900
this is the URL I was telling you about

477
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:05,730
which mentioned file download which is

478
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,980
one of the tests that we were seeing and

479
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,620
here you can see that it's been executed

480
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:15,000
now another one of them - ports that I

481
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:18,719
really like the module that we have

482
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:24,210
activated before which registers all the

483
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:26,100
movements with PowerShell and here you

484
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:35,970
can see everything that's been executed

485
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:41,959
through PowerShell so you can see all

486
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:46,230
the movement where the by load has

487
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,910
loaded it's a test shot ps1 so you've

488
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:52,380
got different tests on different

489
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:55,310
locations and there are several filters

490
00:30:52,380 --> 00:31:02,160
as well with the names the machines the

491
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:04,710
things that have been executed and oh no

492
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,450
this is very useful because then we know

493
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:09,480
the technique we've got the PowerShell

494
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,940
code and this allows us to then see all

495
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,610
the attacks that we have generated into

496
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:17,610
the infrastructure now this is all very

497
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,560
well when it comes to the issue of

498
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,959
representation but for us in order to be

499
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:25,260
quicker and more agile when we do this

500
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,180
we have generated a series of queries

501
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:34,410
that we're going to launch now we're

502
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:38,160
going to show you some of them yeah just

503
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:40,470
to explain where this comes from we've

504
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,370
got a lot of information that powerful

505
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:46,830
has given us we've done some research

506
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:54,750
with the resource that we have mentioned

507
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:55,199
before people have uploaded information

508
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:01,700
can

509
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:05,730
hey me now yeah people can upload

510
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:10,620
information to his web resource a lot

511
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:13,580
office sis ma signal rules but for me

512
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:18,949
have been very useful to see what people

513
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,949
been sharing sharing information is key

514
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:25,139
and we see here that we've got 16 rules

515
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:28,860
that we have taken from there and these

516
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:32,039
refer to attacks with PowerShell this is

517
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:37,289
very powerful then we have translated

518
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:46,158
air into and we have adapted it through

519
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:49,379
this workshop my colleague was saying

520
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:53,429
we're going to launch a search with this

521
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:57,330
tactic so what we're going to do now we

522
00:32:53,429 --> 00:33:05,220
are to search for this tactic we

523
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:08,789
associated with an index scene in this

524
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:13,380
case is that the usual index was not

525
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:16,350
giving us so in this infrastructure it

526
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:20,000
has its own index to associate all the

527
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:24,840
data and the the index in this case was

528
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:29,070
hunting because the configuration of

529
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:31,529
this machine gives its own informant but

530
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,830
it was a day to realize that by the way

531
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:39,240
but anyway it's here and we've launched

532
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:43,199
a search and we've said just bring

533
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,809
whatever you have on T 1086 which is a

534
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,360
powerful technique but wise we're here

535
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:50,490
we've said well let's just launch a few

536
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:55,379
more searches and as you can see this

537
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:58,110
looks full files on the drive with the

538
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,149
PowerShell extension which is P is 1 and

539
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:05,330
so we're going to be able to see the

540
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:08,270
commands and have been executed and

541
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:13,399
these are here they are silly

542
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:16,389
classified by house as you can see all

543
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:20,270
these instructions have been executed

544
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:22,250
and this is very useful to check whether

545
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:26,090
this works properly with the machines

546
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:27,918
and which locks it has recovered and

547
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:33,080
which it hasn't recovered and is very

548
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:37,370
interesting as well of course if we want

549
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:38,779
to search command by administration and

550
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:42,380
all the environments that we have to

551
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:47,419
employ or in this case we're going to do

552
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:52,310
three obviously in an organisation there

553
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:56,540
and only three systems but in this case

554
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:59,330
it works because this is a small lab and

555
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,770
this in this way working go fast then we

556
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,740
can see everything that to do with

557
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:07,190
PowerShell we even have the forwarder

558
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:10,069
here which is what we used to send the

559
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:14,090
logs yeah they are classified by Machine

560
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:19,580
by log we have references to Gibbs as

561
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:21,800
well and as we go on we're going to see

562
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:25,700
the last command execution through

563
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:31,910
PowerShell which has been filtered by

564
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:33,859
the mitre category this is a bit hard to

565
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,200
do like this I know we're going really

566
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,390
fast but we don't have that much time

567
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,359
and anyway you will be able to then

568
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:44,810
check this again on the internet and

569
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:47,680
here I'll choose a category basically

570
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:50,330
what we're doing here is all on

571
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,660
execution so we see the time that has

572
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:55,630
been done we've got a registry here from

573
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:58,160
the other day when I was working on this

574
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:01,880
so this is just to show you that you can

575
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,310
see everything here for example this is

576
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,990
using W me anyway you've got everything

577
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:12,830
here yeah and now we're going on to the

578
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:19,359
one which is complete we can filter by

579
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:19,360
time technique host in a orderly way

580
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,740
as you can see we have quite a lot of

581
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:30,720
results some of them are from the other

582
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:33,629
day when we were working now if we check

583
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:37,560
the events and this is one of the

584
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:41,490
reasons why we like Splunk because you

585
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:45,720
can easily see information about the

586
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:47,879
hosts you get the percentage of shorts

587
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:53,089
where it has taken the information from

588
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:56,850
we can see the values the Technic values

589
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,920
we also see in a more detail you

590
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:02,130
probably know Splunk already by now but

591
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,760
anyway they it's a wonder really the

592
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:07,230
amount of information that we get and we

593
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,170
also I mean we're going to show you

594
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:21,390
alternatives as well they're out there

595
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:25,619
are several alternatives so after

596
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:28,859
working with detection lab we decided

597
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:31,680
that this infrastructure needs very high

598
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:39,960
resources so we decided to create our

599
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:42,029
own lab and this we did by reducing the

600
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:46,560
application deployment in order to

601
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:48,270
deploy the environment in a more easy in

602
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,279
an easier way because we haven't

603
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:53,130
mentioned other things that this

604
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:58,410
environment has such as OS query which

605
00:37:53,130 --> 00:38:02,040
we saw the other day here and our

606
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:03,930
colleague told us in detail about our

607
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,960
Squier and we wanted to actually talk

608
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:09,509
about it but it's already been said and

609
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,310
this is in this tool this is a very

610
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:17,210
useful tool for system administration

611
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:22,500
for finding IO sees in a language but in

612
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:24,090
SQL language so if you can just have a

613
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,619
look at the project because it's very

614
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:33,130
interesting well no we decided not to

615
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:37,839
use it in our lab you can

616
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:42,720
on here from left to right that the two

617
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:49,450
of us are there working on our computers

618
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:54,609
and this is displayed down into a

619
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:57,069
Windows Server which is Windows 10 and

620
00:38:54,609 --> 00:39:00,578
what I mentioned was the clients and

621
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:04,150
they've all been configurated with

622
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:10,900
assessment configuration and we'll see

623
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:14,079
that later on so that we can see all the

624
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,549
formation that is being collected this

625
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,410
is a little bit different to the one we

626
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:24,279
saw before well he did a couple of tests

627
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:30,089
on the information that was provided

628
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:34,720
before and then we have s out here and

629
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:38,640
the last of of all of them is caldera we

630
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:42,328
decided to download it onto a server

631
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:46,480
because if this is the best way of

632
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:50,470
generating information with caldera this

633
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,380
is the structure and I'll talk a bit

634
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:54,879
more about that later later on because

635
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:59,680
you will see that it's quite simple and

636
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:03,640
you can do it we just need a server and

637
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,859
the windows to have a little mini

638
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:13,660
infrastructure for a mini attack well we

639
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:16,119
did that little bit later on this these

640
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:21,930
are the characteristics of our simple

641
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:25,150
server and the technical details of that

642
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:27,009
what's the good about the work we've

643
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:37,109
done with sis man anybody know sis man

644
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:39,190
here it's tool it needs an ad hoc

645
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:42,730
configuration of what we're looking for

646
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:45,549
so you can see this installation is very

647
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:48,950
simple we have a command

648
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:52,130
it needs to be an XML and needs to be

649
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:55,339
adapted to our needs so what did we

650
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:58,579
decide to do with that X M L we decided

651
00:40:55,339 --> 00:41:02,720
to do these two algorithms and a number

652
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:06,010
of filters depending on the elements

653
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,009
that I'm interested in

654
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:16,160
hey if he would I match include and

655
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:18,920
we'll include that one match include so

656
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,000
that it is then later recorded from the

657
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:25,369
system and with a four order it can be

658
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,790
sent through to our system that's the

659
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:27,790
process

660
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:36,680
pretty good configuration we got the

661
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:39,770
basis of Swift on security you've got

662
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,049
the links there you can play around with

663
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:46,730
a bit with that do some modifications

664
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:50,990
and using your own hosts and do a

665
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:57,920
virtual attack and you see how all those

666
00:41:50,990 --> 00:42:01,069
sir processes flow down in a pack we're

667
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:07,549
going to map what ups happens in C user

668
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:12,440
in program data and in Windows 10 with

669
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:15,140
people who work with malware like to

670
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:19,809
have a very rare who Civ area in which

671
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,808
all these malicious entities can enter

672
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:27,140
it can also be used for administration

673
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:30,859
of systems but also for the map so it's

674
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:32,960
all registered here we're going to

675
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:35,990
register all this basis of course it's

676
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,700
very important the basis of the script

677
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:41,029
as well in Java

678
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:46,910
of course we register everything that

679
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:51,890
we're interested in and move on to the

680
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:55,190
next filter regarding the suspicious

681
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:57,740
reports we have a bathroom

682
00:42:55,190 --> 00:43:02,600
and on the right you have a description

683
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:04,580
of the why you can have a look at it and

684
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:08,710
spend a bit of time on that have a

685
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:12,319
coffee it took me a while the first time

686
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:18,350
we register what we want on the proxy

687
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:22,850
level and of course in the ports and we

688
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:32,120
go into another section here so what we

689
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:36,710
want to register at the bottom you can

690
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:38,240
see the domains when Windows updates we

691
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:43,490
know that's fine and there's no issues

692
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:51,140
with that we do the configuration based

693
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:54,529
on our needs so let's have a look at

694
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,629
persistence it's very important to

695
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,040
control everything that happens in terms

696
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:04,340
of persistence that's the first thing

697
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:10,100
that malware can do we log all of this

698
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:12,590
information look at all the incidents

699
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:27,740
and events that could be the beginning

700
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:31,160
of an attack H PA and so on and so on so

701
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:35,270
in terms of crashing we're going to do a

702
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:39,230
script with a number of services here we

703
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:42,350
have one from Microsoft and of course we

704
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:48,380
have our forwarder we have the Splunk

705
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:54,230
here so we're going to not take that

706
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:56,330
into account here and we're ready so

707
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:59,150
this is the configuration per se of our

708
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:03,680
lab if we're doing this from home this

709
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:07,340
is great if you already know detection

710
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,109
lab and in our casein we in our case we

711
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,240
did we

712
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:13,090
okay let's do something it might be a

713
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:18,339
little bit simple but it'll be useful in

714
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:22,690
order to be able to control a an origin

715
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:27,340
and ghost we use a machine and it's all

716
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:31,690
sent through to spunk cloud so in terms

717
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:32,710
of infrastructure we had the basics and

718
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,680
we're going to talk a little bit more

719
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:39,640
about other tools now this is the one

720
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:43,299
that I started off with in this sector

721
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:47,230
it was soft lk there are many different

722
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:50,280
components here you have the link it's a

723
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:55,120
virtual machine and you can download it

724
00:45:50,280 --> 00:46:01,240
it's got an elevated resistance and

725
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:06,040
there's a lot of software behind it so

726
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:09,009
it does need a lot of RAM with eight

727
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,590
gigabytes of RAM you're okay some people

728
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:13,450
do it with six but so then I don't know

729
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:19,090
how they manage to do a decent search

730
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:22,960
you can download this and I've done this

731
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:26,830
I execute it and it's really easy we're

732
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,110
not going to go into depth on this it's

733
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:33,490
just a machine that's used in lots of

734
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:39,670
training situations for hunting for

735
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:41,589
Incident Response and it has a log that

736
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,190
you download it and you set it to work

737
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:47,830
and off you go

738
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:49,720
it looks at how you're compromised that

739
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:55,360
it's all configured and set up so it's

740
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:58,180
very very easy so now let's talk about

741
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:01,930
help what did you think when you saw

742
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:04,299
Hulk I thought it was so amazing you'll

743
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:07,660
see it's rather different what we've

744
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:12,340
seen before in detection lab but we'll

745
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:16,660
see it now there are many components and

746
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:19,539
that's what makes it so big so in terms

747
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:22,500
of requirements

748
00:47:19,539 --> 00:47:29,140
it's similar to the one we saw before

749
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:32,940
you've got the github there for you any

750
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:35,799
of you familiar with Roberto Rodriguez

751
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,779
he's a reference in this field and

752
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:42,490
there's a lot of information in this

753
00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:48,490
github we've also included something

754
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:52,209
else by a collaborator it's Mordor we'll

755
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:56,459
see we'll see this in working now in a

756
00:47:52,210 --> 00:48:01,319
moment it has all these different

757
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:05,250
components and terms of software and

758
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:07,599
it's really rather good

759
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:15,150
we've checked it and we've seen that

760
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:20,109
it's really rather good help can be

761
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:23,589
installed anywhere you can download it

762
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:27,190
onto your server as we have done install

763
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:28,750
it onto your computer and then you go

764
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:31,690
through the process it tells you the

765
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:34,529
steps that you have to take in order to

766
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:43,630
set up the installation and how to

767
00:48:34,529 --> 00:48:55,779
upload the data for a test it was on

768
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:59,049
stop so once it's off it's wonderful it

769
00:48:55,779 --> 00:49:00,160
needs to upload the process so once

770
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:02,549
that's going on we'll have a look at

771
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,549
something else

772
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:28,470
let's have a look at what we already had

773
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:34,020
open before it's a screen here with

774
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:35,700
Carlos is pretty full we've used this

775
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:41,610
circuit bid because it's easier to cop

776
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:46,430
their copy their commands and so on okay

777
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:52,650
it's ongoing now so in the meantime I'm

778
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:56,370
going to have a look at this here you

779
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:59,910
have all the links so let's have a

780
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:05,730
little bit of a browse through here it's

781
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:09,149
all set out in categories all the data

782
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:10,410
and there are a number of examples and a

783
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:14,670
number of logs that have already been

784
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:18,720
created so easily with this you can

785
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:21,510
import and we'll do that

786
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:25,950
because it's a shame that our computers

787
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:28,200
and working you can see everything

788
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:32,879
they've done a series of data you can

789
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:43,439
see that it's pretty good you've got

790
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:46,940
their github already prepared you create

791
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,710
your own server and you have to do the

792
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:51,360
installment and to indicate their

793
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:54,930
principal doctor and so and so on I

794
00:50:51,360 --> 00:51:00,630
think you have four options I chose the

795
00:50:54,930 --> 00:51:04,200
most simple of them all number one and

796
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:06,300
it's very basic and I just went with

797
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,299
that you'll see there are four options

798
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:12,750
if you go to the fourth one then you'll

799
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,610
need a very powerful computer it's or

800
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:17,790
threat hunting and so on it's very

801
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:18,880
pretty good but it does have a number of

802
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:23,349
requirements

803
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:28,269
you know we are 30 so on here I'm going

804
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:30,009
to inject quite a bit of data like what

805
00:51:28,269 --> 00:51:35,729
we did before with detection lab yeah we

806
00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:39,519
could do that of course we could I

807
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:45,190
downloaded this from rip of the IP of

808
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:47,649
the Machine and this day shop and here

809
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:50,950
you have all the information it takes

810
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:54,220
you to the web and I can see all of this

811
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:56,828
data as simple as that I think it's

812
00:51:54,220 --> 00:52:00,328
pretty useful if you'd like to start now

813
00:51:56,829 --> 00:52:00,329
then no you it's pretty easy

814
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:15,470
perfect

815
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:17,720
what I was saying okay we've got the

816
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:20,660
machine that's working now we've got

817
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:30,319
these two files the installation of hell

818
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:35,240
and Mordor on the left here we have the

819
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:37,460
data set and we have a few what have you

820
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:43,060
been using in this workshop well this

821
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:47,840
one here let's go to this one we've

822
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:52,100
slipped the file and we have a number of

823
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:57,080
commands and this is the one so we open

824
00:52:52,100 --> 00:53:07,210
it up and we'll see what it or consists

825
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:11,840
of this log you've got all the dates

826
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:17,120
here on the right hand side we've got

827
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:20,680
more information but we'll see it a lot

828
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,680
better here in our environment

829
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,020
we're crossing our fingers that'll work

830
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:46,370
so we just did the configuration and we

831
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:54,560
put in the IP it's not working on the

832
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:58,730
stopper the computer is pausing right

833
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:07,730
now but we'll restart and it'll all work

834
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:10,090
perfectly well my little dear let's give

835
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:10,090
it another try

836
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:38,720
automatically yeah I think we're going

837
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:44,930
to have to use the video that we've got

838
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:47,839
here whilst it starts up we can look at

839
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:48,799
the information using a video we also we

840
00:54:47,839 --> 00:55:07,940
always need a backup

841
00:54:48,800 --> 00:55:09,470
this can happen a key comment okay now

842
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,109
it's working

843
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:17,480
I had one IP he had another and visually

844
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:22,750
it's pretty attractive we have some data

845
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,750
over here that's matched with my turn

846
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:28,490
I'm good to see the one about attack if

847
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,440
I want to look about Mobile's I select

848
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:31,430
that and I learn about the ones related

849
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,560
to mobiles

850
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:41,000
it's pretty good I apply the selection

851
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:43,369
this is data set I think I put 8 in so

852
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,359
it's using all that information we've

853
00:55:43,369 --> 00:55:53,830
got the cloud and a number of techniques

854
00:55:47,359 --> 00:56:02,140
and I can determine the execution it's

855
00:55:53,830 --> 00:56:07,060
filtering now I can see those data cells

856
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:12,129
and this is focusing here in PowerShell

857
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:12,130
and I think it's pretty interesting

858
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:19,149
showing you some different filters now

859
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:24,290
what I was talking to you about

860
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:26,570
previously these are all their movements

861
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:29,690
and the steps we've taken previously so

862
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:34,339
let's go ahead and do a search so now

863
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:37,869
that we've put in a data set we need to

864
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:37,869
see the information it can provide

865
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:46,370
we filter based on a date taken from

866
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:51,940
their data set I do a little mitigation

867
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:51,940
to see what might have executed it that

868
00:56:52,270 --> 00:57:00,430
we can do a little visual here to stop

869
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:05,920
the processes online and we can see the

870
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:05,919
results that are included in this cell

871
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:16,580
this was a visual view these are the

872
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:23,330
servers the hosts on which it has been

873
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:33,380
working the ones that are infected okay

874
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:36,490
this is from the nineteen oh the host

875
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:41,840
and it's executing a Power Cell but it's

876
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:45,259
encoded you can't see it easily so what

877
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:53,960
we do is go and do the corresponding

878
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:58,100
search we used in CT EPS and I've used

879
00:57:53,960 --> 00:58:03,080
it a lot myself you can see it very

880
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:06,190
easily we do a filter let's seeing what

881
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:12,920
the PowerShell is trying to do and we

882
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:15,440
noticed there same thing with air P H P

883
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:23,540
and there's something refering to a

884
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:26,660
Windows register set on that registry

885
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:32,630
which is nothing good then you can see

886
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:36,640
the strings as well and finally what we

887
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:45,940
can see is the logging process or PHP

888
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:48,140
and then again 64 so we take that

889
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:50,520
notification and we're going to see what

890
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:52,049
it was trying to do because from that

891
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:54,180
is going to download another resource

892
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:58,260
and that is probably where the malware

893
00:58:54,180 --> 00:59:01,140
is so we do this and we'll see that that

894
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:04,260
is the address and this is how you can

895
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:11,400
do a quick investigation with the data

896
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:15,030
set that this application gives us we've

897
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:17,370
got different data sets we've got one we

898
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:21,240
can look for groups I talked about

899
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:26,640
Lazarus earlier here we can select the

900
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:28,529
group could we do this through myself

901
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,150
through its website yes

902
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:33,060
but here we've got it in a different way

903
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:35,850
and we could choose which one we wanted

904
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:38,840
to work with if we chose Lazarus for

905
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:43,770
example here you can see that it is

906
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:45,810
launching the search and that they will

907
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:50,700
use a series of relationships we can see

908
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:53,250
all the information there is and

909
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:55,830
obviously this information comes from

910
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:58,950
the my cell phone work but it be it's

911
00:59:55,830 --> 01:00:00,240
shown in a different way we've got all

912
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:08,129
the - ports which are very interesting

913
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:11,370
for example investigating a home and as

914
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:14,880
we were talking about sis mo let's show

915
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:23,160
you a dashboard which is exclusively for

916
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:26,580
sis mo why would we use this in fact for

917
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,440
example if I wanted to see ID for then I

918
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:31,799
can see all the information just by

919
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:34,230
inputting it here we can see all the

920
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:38,450
registers that have been generates it

921
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:38,450
and we've got others as well of course

922
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:48,890
you can do this at home on your own and

923
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,890
now it seems this has actually lifted

924
01:00:49,100 --> 01:01:03,690
yeah it has well we've got help here and

925
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:11,340
hunting this is by default by the way

926
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:17,290
what so you can see it's pretty static

927
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:19,840
the dashboards are already done oh you

928
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:26,560
can launch a search with the data that

929
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:28,180
we have infected and well you can see

930
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,190
that it's working fast now as we

931
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:34,629
rebooted it it started working better

932
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:36,880
and here we can launch our searches and

933
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:38,850
just fiddle a little bit around with

934
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:45,130
this application which is really really

935
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:52,319
recommended now let's continue with the

936
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:58,180
presentation now yogi

937
01:01:52,320 --> 01:02:00,550
Martha babe here we're going to ask you

938
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:02,950
in the same way but with it earlier

939
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,690
yeah that we do exactly the same things

940
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:08,259
that we did earlier with the QR code

941
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:08,740
we're going to rebooted so you can

942
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,620
answer

943
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:13,689
you've got the QR code there at the top

944
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:16,450
if you cannot use the QR you can use the

945
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:17,500
link and then input the code and please

946
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:21,569
answer the question

947
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:24,520
I feel an emotional loss quadrant of the

948
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:27,100
emotional so idea today what we have is

949
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:29,560
four environments and we would like you

950
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:32,410
to we would like to know which one you

951

like best lassen well we have told you

952
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:36,339
which one I have drawn your attention

953
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:39,430
more Connors would what do you reckon

954

where it

957
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:54,240
please keep answering use the QR let's

958
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:54,240
see how this is going

959
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:08,618
i'ma say right here we are

960
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:18,740
Oh more info I've got 11 people who have

961
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:20,830
answered you can you can do from home as

962
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:24,910
well arms if you're watching us on

963
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:24,910
streaming you can answer the question

964
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:37,400
yeah we're very very different actually

965
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:40,790
we're just talking about the difference

966
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:47,290
could be we could have material off

967
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:51,500
another workshop one has many more

968
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:55,460
security applications which are the

969
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:59,270
order of the day the project has over

970
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:07,130
two years but in the last month they're

971
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:09,380
really so we think this is very complete

972
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:11,450
and we like obviously our lab because

973
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:13,520
we've done ourselves because they will

974
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:18,020
have taken everything that was of

975
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:20,630
interest to us and that fulfilled needs

976
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,940
and then obviously you've got help which

977
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:26,270
is very good because from a visual point

978
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:29,750
of view it's wonderful and in order to

979
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:33,050
learn about Ted hunting you can inject a

980
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:34,910
lot of datasets and you can study each

981
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:39,050
and every one of the techniques so I

982
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:41,480
think the answer is a generic one all of

983
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:45,620
them are good depending on the state

984
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:48,140
you're in if you know a bit more you can

985
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:51,290
start with the detection lab if not you

986
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:53,000
can try with help if you want to find

987
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:55,520
out new things detection lab is really

988
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,770
good as well and then obviously depends

989
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:00,050
on the resources you have because

990
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:05,930
sometimes with a detection lab you need

991
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:08,600
at least 20 Giga if you have eight on

992
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:11,870
your computer then you can have help and

993
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:15,200
take the data set form order yeah if you

994
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:20,089
have a very basic machine well use those

995
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:22,960
or you can also use soft okay we've got

996
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:22,960
18 answers now

997
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:38,230
we're going to make it trail now and oh

998
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:38,230
hell has one well we're not surprised

999
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:46,339
and now let's go on to attack simulation

1000
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:50,210
as we were mentioning earlier on our

1001
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:52,220
home lab there is caldera with that's

1002
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:56,120
the one we've used to emulate the

1003
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:59,750
attacks but now let's look a little bit

1004
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:04,520
more in detail what though there are

1005
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:08,600
it's this is built on the miter a tape

1006
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:10,759
AAT TN ck they have created it with a

1007
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:13,640
lot of plugins so we can work with it

1008
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:15,410
and now let's look into detail what

1009
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:18,560
those plugins are and what we can use

1010
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:21,710
them for now as you can see this machine

1011
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:25,210
has been configured I have used 3 Giga

1012
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:28,100
and 2 core 1 core it doesn't have to be

1013
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:29,810
very resourceful you Janine hi resources

1014
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:42,880
because I do today or we need to do is

1015
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:52,700
launch attacks right let's deploy

1016
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:55,910
calderas machine and well I cannot have

1017
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:57,200
on this computer 20 machines active at

1018
01:06:55,910 --> 01:07:05,120
the same time so I'm going to use

1019
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:07,189
Windows 10 and DC so detection lab to

1020
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,779
relaunch those attacks in that

1021
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:11,570
infrastructure and at the same time

1022
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:14,120
we're going to visualize through Splunk

1023
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:16,340
those attacks and see if they have

1024
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:23,299
registered correctly luckily fear more

1025
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:34,010
Lord you know so whilst we launch

1026
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:35,600
caldera let's reboot Windows 10 yeah cuz

1027
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:38,020
we've been demanding a bit too much for

1028
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,020
me

1029
01:07:38,869 --> 01:07:43,460
we're going to show you just how

1030
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:45,500
attacker generated with caldera that's

1031
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:47,750
what we saw at the beginning but lousy

1032
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:50,030
half base let's just try and register

1033
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,890
everything and launch the attacks and

1034
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,609
then you can see how they register on

1035
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:54,910
the other one

1036
01:07:52,609 --> 01:07:59,390
in this way you can see the full picture

1037
01:07:54,910 --> 01:08:01,160
on the one hand we have attack the

1038
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:04,569
machines and then externally we have you

1039
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,569
Scout that out to do the tests

1040
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:10,359
so let's lift with calderas machine now

1041
01:08:20,069 --> 01:08:27,339
if cousin work then it would really be

1042
01:08:24,368 --> 01:08:36,130
bad luck because it's never ever failed

1043
01:08:27,339 --> 01:08:38,139
before Windows 10 from DC lab sometimes

1044
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:40,089
it needs a bit more resources than the

1045
01:08:38,139 --> 01:08:43,179
default ones because sometimes when you

1046
01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:44,769
launch the attack it turns itself off

1047
01:08:43,179 --> 01:08:58,989
but it is true that we demand too much

1048
01:08:44,770 --> 01:09:02,560
from it and wow this is loading let's

1049
01:08:58,988 --> 01:09:05,318
see to attack simulators one is going to

1050
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:07,929
be with Godzilla and you're the one

1051
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:10,900
which is by the way a caldera is open

1052
01:09:07,929 --> 01:09:13,449
source and another one which is not open

1053
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:16,679
source of simulate it is impossible to

1054
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:19,448
see it in detail because it's very

1055
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:21,279
complete but we're going to look at one

1056
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:32,379
of the modules and how they simulate the

1057
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:35,710
attacks it's not working so we're

1058
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:40,170
probably going to use a video because

1059
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:40,170
it's taking a bit too long power backup

1060
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:47,199
I'm sure the ones you've watched the

1061
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:53,259
video it will start working if you know

1062
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:55,119
no capacity get a well don't worry about

1063
01:09:53,259 --> 01:09:58,770
that one just just play the video and

1064
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:58,769
then we'll see yeah let's do that

1065
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:08,380
in the casserole I would show fire but

1066
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:10,740
home with not a lot of failures but Cal

1067
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:15,370
did I had never really failed before

1068
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:21,099
this is no caldera it's just doesn't

1069
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:25,599
want to launch and we're using the same

1070
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:27,700
portal whack-a-mole as I said LM we're

1071
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,670
going to analyze everything through our

1072
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:33,610
browser now as you've seen here I have

1073
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:37,900
added machine caldera to welcome also I

1074
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:44,320
can administer it remotely through C CH

1075
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:48,309
s CA s H and we're going to lift caldera

1076
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:50,950
we're going to download the get we're

1077
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:53,470
going to install the requirements and

1078
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:58,059
live the server this is something very

1079
01:10:53,470 --> 01:11:04,030
easy it does require Python 3.7 minimum

1080
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:07,210
our minimum is 3.5 new update the tasks

1081
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:10,300
come out recently and and we're going to

1082
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:14,140
share it to you and see what they have

1083
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:20,230
improved this video what we are doing is

1084
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:25,300
attacking Windows 10 we access it

1085
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:27,610
through the console what we do is

1086
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:30,520
because Windows 10 through whack-a-mole

1087
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:32,920
will not allow me to copy/paste whereas

1088
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:35,830
with other machines it works we still

1089
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:39,060
don't know why by the way and so because

1090
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:43,990
of that well we've decided to do is

1091
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:48,340
access through the machines browser

1092
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:49,990
we've had to do it like this but you

1093
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,880
don't usually have to do like this you

1094
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:55,120
should be just do it through the agent

1095
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:57,430
so we go on calderas interface because

1096
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:59,680
it's administered completely through web

1097
01:11:57,430 --> 01:12:01,750
interface you can also use the terminal

1098
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:05,890
but it's much more visual like this in

1099
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:11,680
my opinion and in order to launch the

1100
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:14,090
attacks we use sand cat and we're going

1101
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:17,190
to establish the communication again

1102
01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:18,719
calozero and caldera is going to launch

1103
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:21,478
those attacks that we're going to

1104
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:24,449
prepare now as you can see we'll just

1105
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:27,630
select the OS that we have for Windows

1106
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:33,329
you can install CMD or powershell and

1107
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:35,760
then mac and linux any version so we

1108
01:12:33,329 --> 01:12:37,739
will compile shell here we copy the

1109
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:42,599
command we paste the command and we

1110
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:47,879
launch it and it says the condition has

1111
01:12:42,599 --> 01:12:52,800
been successful and now there's just

1112
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:56,429
open caldera from our browser and let's

1113
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:58,650
generate an attack first of all we're

1114
01:12:56,429 --> 01:13:01,889
going to see if there was a connection

1115
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:03,478
other than the command that has taught

1116
01:13:01,889 --> 01:13:05,099
us that condition has been successful

1117
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:07,679
let's see if the interface has seen it

1118
01:13:05,099 --> 01:13:10,349
as well so when we have a group of

1119
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,900
machines and this gives us just one if

1120
01:13:10,349 --> 01:13:14,670
we have a group a Windows machines for

1121
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:17,249
example and we want to attack the whole

1122
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:20,459
machine we assigned the same group work

1123
01:13:17,249 --> 01:13:23,789
the same name and when we're going to

1124
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:28,139
launch the attack we do it for the whole

1125
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:31,320
group in this case there's only one

1126
01:13:28,139 --> 01:13:33,300
machine as I was saying but the demo

1127
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:39,539
curb we were going to show was with two

1128
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:45,959
machines we've decided to launch hunter

1129
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:49,768
fest and hunter adds a lot of discovery

1130
01:13:45,959 --> 01:13:51,690
tactic but I go in to help us to extract

1131
01:13:49,769 --> 01:13:56,219
a lot of information from the machines

1132
01:13:51,690 --> 01:13:57,780
this is default for a configuration but

1133
01:13:56,219 --> 01:14:01,769
then we're going to see how to create

1134
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:03,570
our own adversary you can see everything

1135
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:05,999
that it has and it's organized in

1136
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:08,699
different phases you see that some have

1137
01:14:05,999 --> 01:14:11,519
a padlock or a key and that is because

1138
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:13,919
it requires specific information

1139
01:14:11,519 --> 01:14:17,459
extracted from other phases in order to

1140
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:20,900
do that action sometimes for example it

1141
01:14:17,459 --> 01:14:28,280
needs the machines password

1142
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:32,269
Oh VIP so through discovery you extract

1143
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:35,059
all the informations so what we're going

1144
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:47,570
to do is to generate an attack operation

1145
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:49,280
we give it a name we select the

1146
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:55,099
adversary which is hunter in this case

1147
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:58,370
and the group we are going to attack and

1148
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:59,480
which hits that and as you can see it's

1149
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:01,460
working

1150
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:04,099
it goes face by face in this case only

1151
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:06,230
three because it's the first three and

1152
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:08,840
Caldera is not perfect because nothing

1153
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:11,030
is perfect so it's sometimes it does

1154
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:15,350
fail because it's still under

1155
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:18,920
development so here you see that it has

1156
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:21,860
launched the Who am I command the

1157
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:24,500
machine has responded and it has stalled

1158
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:26,210
that response now the good thing is that

1159
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:28,880
you can see the commands that have been

1160
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:32,270
executed it explains the techniques that

1161
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:35,720
it is using and so - if you want to

1162
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:38,210
learn it's quite quite useful now you

1163
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,340
just copy those commands and you will

1164
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:42,560
obtain the same information though we

1165
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:45,110
are showing here that command is

1166
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:48,800
actually extracting the user accounts in

1167
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:52,670
that machine and as you can see some of

1168
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:54,560
them are win - domain which are the

1169
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:59,630
accounts of the domain that machine is

1170
01:15:54,560 --> 01:16:08,060
linked to this is one of the evidences

1171
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:10,190
that we have well as you can see here

1172
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:12,500
this is one of the most interesting ones

1173
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:17,240
which is discovering whether there is an

1174
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:19,250
antivirus or not and where it is and it

1175
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:21,200
says the same process with a firewall it

1176
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:29,300
checks whether there is a firewall and

1177
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:32,840
where it is domain and if you go

1178
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:39,559
it can also identify looking stuff endo

1179
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:42,280
is and it can create a directory just by

1180
01:16:39,559 --> 01:16:50,690
executing that command we can create a

1181
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:52,639
directory in C in the use of file this

1182
01:16:50,690 --> 01:17:00,518
is what I was been talking about before

1183
01:16:52,639 --> 01:17:00,519
about firewall it tells us where it is

1184
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:17,058
here it tells us about the photos that

1185
01:17:05,269 --> 01:17:18,940
are being shared and from here we can

1186
01:17:17,059 --> 01:17:22,130
get low information which is then stored

1187
01:17:18,940 --> 01:17:27,348
this is the name of them domain the

1188
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:30,820
Machine the domain is integrated in so

1189
01:17:27,349 --> 01:17:30,820
local is the machine

1190
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:45,460
my little girls are there yes now what

1191
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:48,280
we're going to do now is to create a run

1192
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:51,910
at bursary and you can see that we have

1193
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:53,530
used a pre-configured adversary by

1194
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:56,380
caldera and now we're going to configure

1195
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:58,360
our own with PowerShell shall we try and

1196
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:02,730
see if it works now see if it's lifted

1197
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:06,179
and if it is then we can launch our own

1198
01:18:02,730 --> 01:18:09,009
we've been lucky it's lifted correctly

1199
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:10,420
so let's launch their attack they are

1200
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:17,320
going to create we're going to launch it

1201
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:23,560
on both I had close to an window so

1202
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:26,190
let's open up again and let's lift

1203
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,190
caldera

1204
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:46,270
I'm always holiday so we lived caldera

1205
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:53,370
we going to check that in our browser

1206
01:18:46,270 --> 01:19:01,750
that it really has actually lifted us

1207
01:18:53,370 --> 01:19:10,120
Windows seven starts up Windows 10

1208
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:15,190
starts up the defect password is admin

1209
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:19,809
admin and Linus explains that it's here

1210
01:19:15,190 --> 01:19:24,599
by default and we indicate that we want

1211
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:24,600
to interact so we have to have billet 8

1212
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:35,320
in mark for the caldera installation we

1213
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:39,220
can put in our information and carry out

1214
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:41,889
a tak based on the data that we have

1215
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:44,740
from caldera it'll be lit like little

1216
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:48,220
machines within caldera itself without

1217
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:53,230
using up resources and we can launch

1218
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:58,170
attacks on emulated clients so it's an

1219
01:19:53,230 --> 01:20:06,450
emulation of an emulation of an attack

1220
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:08,380
that's exactly what it is we have he

1221
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:14,500
calculators from the previous attack

1222
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:21,850
here in the server machine we can copy

1223
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:26,710
from whack-a-mole we have our agent with

1224
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:30,100
PowerShell and when PowerShell starts up

1225
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:39,190
we'll do that we'll start up the Machine

1226
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:40,960
the Windows client so that we can copy

1227
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:49,059
the command that I mentioned before

1228
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:51,710
without opening the browser we have

1229
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:56,270
PowerShell as an administrator in

1230
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:59,469
to carry out attacks and some attacks

1231
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:59,469
required those kinds of privileges

1232
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:05,889
whilst it's starting up we'll have a

1233
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:05,889
look at the other one we already have it

1234
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,440
let's see if it's not going to copy now

1235
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:35,300
I'm afraid it's not copying either so

1236
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:39,530
let's go directly we're going to open up

1237
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:41,210
the page directly open up the caldera

1238
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:42,620
page and we'll do it from there we

1239
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:49,130
didn't really want to do with that but

1240
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:56,690
we're going to have to it's not going to

1241
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:59,090
allow me to copy again now it's a little

1242
01:21:56,690 --> 01:22:05,559
bit of a problem there before Brett

1243
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:05,560
refreshed this does not usually happen

1244
01:22:15,999 --> 01:22:26,590
so let's open the page and copy the

1245
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:29,439
client like we did in the previous video

1246
01:22:26,590 --> 01:22:37,719
it's very unusual that is not working it

1247
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:41,229
should work it's just copying so once

1248
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:43,989
this is open opening we can see these

1249
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:50,139
machines are a little bit slower because

1250
01:22:43,989 --> 01:22:54,820
we've been asking a lot of them and I

1251
01:22:50,139 --> 01:22:58,059
think ELQ is still working so we already

1252
01:22:54,820 --> 01:23:05,530
have lifted seven machines and that's

1253
01:22:58,059 --> 01:23:08,639
quite a lot so let's get the access

1254
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:08,639
through the web

1255
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:35,010
our demo here we have it so good so

1256
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:35,010
let's go to our sand cat we copy

1257
01:23:47,659 --> 01:23:56,120
I hope everything you go and paste just

1258
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:58,250
seem to want to do it now let's give it

1259
01:23:56,120 --> 01:24:01,599
a chance to think we can do the same

1260
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:01,600
action in Windows 10

1261
01:24:07,179 --> 01:24:22,870
I mean I decide to go in English it's

1262
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:25,620
detected it in English right yes okay

1263
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:25,620
off you go with that

1264
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:45,739
don't fool me I don't put it so there we

1265
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:53,600
have it now if it gets really bad then

1266
01:24:45,739 --> 01:24:56,629
we'll use the videos again where copy

1267
01:24:53,600 --> 01:25:09,610
and do this same step once again so

1268
01:24:56,630 --> 01:25:12,980
let's copy I'm afraid it hasn't pasted

1269
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:14,960
you can do this very easily at home but

1270
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,888
we're going to continue with the video

1271
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:20,480
because it's gotten a little bit

1272
01:25:15,889 --> 01:25:24,230
complicated here we were going to do

1273
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:27,919
this here directly but we're going to

1274
01:25:24,230 --> 01:25:31,309
use the video when we create an

1275
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:33,080
adversary we need to keep this in mind

1276
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:37,760
because otherwise it just now you to

1277
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:44,059
save we have to create a description and

1278
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:48,380
we have our adversary so what tactic are

1279
01:25:44,060 --> 01:26:02,810
we going to use it's basically on

1280
01:25:48,380 --> 01:26:05,270
execution it's the 1086 technique it's

1281
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:11,840
the administrator emulated in PowerShell

1282
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:14,119
and then we add 10:59 and this opens the

1283
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:18,380
calculator if there is a calculator on

1284
01:26:14,119 --> 01:26:22,280
our machine the new Windows 10 does not

1285
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:32,420
have a calculator you have to download

1286
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:37,840
it yourself from the shop so the study

1287
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:39,949
over adversary' we want to see the

1288
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:42,010
techniques that they use that's what

1289
01:26:39,949 --> 01:26:50,919
it's all about

1290
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:52,630
we will assign a name we select world

1291
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:56,890
we're going to a launch and the group

1292
01:26:52,630 --> 01:27:01,870
that we're going to at have we wanted to

1293
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:11,980
launch this in the demo but not also on

1294
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:17,620
10 but on DC as well on the old windows

1295
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:21,280
it's available we're going to see what

1296
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:25,210
it executes it's going to deal with a

1297
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:28,870
file the system administration through

1298
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:31,330
PowerShell when this is generated to

1299
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:35,170
give us some time to create the logs and

1300
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:41,769
the registers and to maintain the

1301
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:43,740
machine as it was yet tries to remove

1302
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:47,320
everything that was generated previously

1303
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:49,510
in Windows 10 there was the calculator

1304
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:54,370
in this particular case it has opened

1305
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:56,400
and it's executed through everything

1306
01:27:54,370 --> 01:28:01,150
that we've injected through PowerShell

1307
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:03,450
this is the new element that they've

1308
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:09,809
added recently I saw it two weeks ago

1309
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:12,099
and this it is the part of the reporting

1310
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:17,730
so once we've done our attack we're

1311
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:23,500
given a report including a download with

1312
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:27,160
information that we can treat we have a

1313
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:29,260
list of all the attacks as in hunter

1314
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:32,170
through phases for example we have them

1315
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:34,500
in this particular case and those that

1316
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:42,120
are executed and those were not all the

1317
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:45,160
agents all the reasons it's basic but

1318
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:52,019
it's just recently been made available

1319
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:52,019
and it's pretty good we have a question

1320
01:28:52,050 --> 01:28:58,019
the idea to show that it can open

1321
01:28:55,369 --> 01:29:00,839
applications and calculators and easy

1322
01:28:58,019 --> 01:29:04,559
application and it's just to show that

1323
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:07,230
it can open applications and lift enough

1324
01:29:04,559 --> 01:29:09,630
lift an application that's what we're

1325
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:13,348
trying to achieve so lifting office

1326
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:14,999
would not make much sense the calculator

1327
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:18,480
was always going to be there until

1328
01:29:14,999 --> 01:29:23,760
recently the most recent update of

1329
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:25,289
Windows does not have the calculator if

1330
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:35,579
you want the calculator you have to

1331
01:29:25,289 --> 01:29:37,559
download it from the shop you can open

1332
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:40,289
the concrete or anything else right yes

1333
01:29:37,559 --> 01:29:42,599
yes but it was just the calculator just

1334
01:29:40,289 --> 01:29:45,030
because it was an example on something

1335
01:29:42,599 --> 01:29:46,590
that was always going to be fair if

1336
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:53,219
there any vulnerabilities and

1337
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:55,739
calculators no no it's just what's used

1338
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:59,070
in the demos and there it's the most

1339
01:29:55,739 --> 01:30:03,150
usual thing we opened the calculator and

1340
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:05,249
power exploit and with detection lab but

1341
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:08,940
not only the calculator but other

1342
01:30:05,249 --> 01:30:12,139
elements as well it was just to show

1343
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:15,530
that it can open calculators and

1344
01:30:12,139 --> 01:30:18,480
applications it was just an example

1345
01:30:15,530 --> 01:30:20,400
there are a number of applications and

1346
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:25,289
it could open them as well but it was

1347
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:31,530
just an easy simple option as we were

1348
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:33,239
saying I haven't found anything any

1349
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:35,659
applications that deals with the

1350
01:30:33,239 --> 01:30:40,169
information that you can find in caldera

1351
01:30:35,659 --> 01:30:42,749
it's just a question of investigating in

1352
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:47,249
order to be able to treat that data so

1353
01:30:42,749 --> 01:30:51,599
this is what caldera is you can use this

1354
01:30:47,249 --> 01:30:53,579
environment without any problems if

1355
01:30:51,599 --> 01:30:54,630
you've got eight figures on your machine

1356
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:57,599
you can use that at home with no

1357
01:30:54,630 --> 01:31:00,780
problems at all so the last one that

1358
01:30:57,599 --> 01:31:03,389
we're going to see for attack simulation

1359
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:04,710
is the one they have here it's not open

1360
01:31:03,389 --> 01:31:07,810
source

1361
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:10,270
but it seemed interesting we thought it

1362
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:17,590
was important to include it we've seen

1363
01:31:10,270 --> 01:31:23,020
caldera what it does it does things it

1364
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:25,750
opens the calculator and so on and this

1365
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:31,600
application is a business one and it is

1366
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:36,820
completely aligned with my term it

1367
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:41,080
installs an agent in the host you have

1368
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:44,170
to put in a number of IPs of course and

1369
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:48,400
directly from an application in the

1370
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:51,159
cloud in Amazon or wherever it will be

1371
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:56,920
configuration in order to attack the

1372
01:31:51,159 --> 01:32:01,089
system this is a simulation of an attack

1373
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:02,560
like Kim Carlita shows that it has

1374
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:05,679
entered it's never going to leave a

1375
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:07,719
ransomware it will never deal with a

1376
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:11,429
computer to that level it just leaves a

1377
01:32:07,719 --> 01:32:15,270
log and you know that it's been attacked

1378
01:32:11,429 --> 01:32:19,239
it's never going to damage your machine

1379
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:27,239
so we have it here and let's have a look

1380
01:32:19,239 --> 01:32:27,239
at it oh dear

1381
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:42,909
why no no I wasn't expecting this there

1382
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:46,480
really wasn't but it's not a problem we

1383
01:32:42,909 --> 01:32:49,750
have it here yeah if I'm always ready

1384
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:53,440
for these kinds of things here we have a

1385
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:56,050
demo account this is the agent that you

1386
01:32:53,440 --> 01:33:01,960
could use on your machine to do a number

1387
01:32:56,050 --> 01:33:05,770
of number of open friends we can't see

1388
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:13,050
them all but we'll see the one for email

1389
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:20,199
gateway applications to check security

1390
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:24,849
gateway level side movements atps apts

1391
01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:28,598
that are directed so what we're seeing

1392
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:31,690
here is the report section I want to

1393
01:33:28,599 --> 01:33:35,079
report for example that is from email

1394
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:39,119
gateway I generate that from a technical

1395
01:33:35,079 --> 01:33:43,230
level executive level or service level

1396
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:45,610
and you can use that to see the

1397
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:49,690
everything that has gone on with a great

1398
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:52,598
level of detail whilst that attack has

1399
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:54,969
gone on we can filter through the ones

1400
01:33:52,599 --> 01:34:02,230
that have penetrated we have a number of

1401
01:33:54,969 --> 01:34:05,309
different options for that attack I just

1402
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:09,000
want to see the ones that gone through

1403
01:34:05,309 --> 01:34:15,420
so the attack that we have seen hat was

1404
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:18,429
launched with more than 4,000 emails and

1405
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:22,119
out of those and X number have been

1406
01:34:18,429 --> 01:34:27,940
penetrated in a few moments this could

1407
01:34:22,119 --> 01:34:33,848
take maybe four five six hours and we

1408
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:36,219
use this to do our filter we can see the

1409
01:34:33,849 --> 01:34:37,840
one to the highest risk and we can see a

1410
01:34:36,219 --> 01:34:41,940
description and this is what I really

1411
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:46,350
like a description of what is going on

1412
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:50,740
we can see from that sip what you get is

1413
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:54,220
an Excel or PPT or whatever and it's

1414
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:58,780
reached our machine and we get a bit

1415
01:34:54,220 --> 01:35:01,210
more detail and then the analyst can see

1416
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:09,130
if that fits in with our systems or not

1417
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:11,650
and give an appropriate feedback you can

1418
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:15,010
see that the report is downloaded we'd

1419
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:17,969
have a look at that later so there are

1420
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:21,850
more than 4,000 attacks as I was saying

1421
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:25,690
this is a demo environment of course

1422
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:31,960
there are a lot we can see the

1423
01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:38,910
description of each one even the new

1424
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:42,070
malware yes we can there are a lot of

1425
01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:45,760
tax recently of a certain kind whether a

1426
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:53,230
special module and you can look at the

1427
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:56,730
view see what has gone on gone on and

1428
01:35:53,230 --> 01:36:00,669
see if trip box would affect your system

1429
01:35:56,730 --> 01:36:02,440
you manage it and you test it this is

1430
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:06,100
what we're doing with the excel that's

1431
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:12,370
downloaded we get that detail for the

1432
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:15,040
surface I set in a number of filters of

1433
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:18,099
the information that I have been given

1434
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:21,820
I see only the ones have been that have

1435
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:27,570
penetrated I can see their date and the

1436
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:31,620
hashes to show what really has gone on

1437
01:36:27,570 --> 01:36:34,299
we can see the high-level impact ones

1438
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:37,330
and we get an introduction into what

1439
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:43,180
these threats are it came through an

1440
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:50,680
email and then went through their ajs or

1441
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:52,180
an HTML 8pa or whatever and this is what

1442
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:54,330
I'm talking about for about mitigation

1443
01:36:52,180 --> 01:37:01,260
it gives you some pieces

1444
01:36:54,330 --> 01:37:10,620
of advice so the report is being

1445
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:13,680
generated the technical report or the

1446
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:24,269
battery seems to have run out we've been

1447
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:30,440
talking quite a lot better thank you

1448
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:30,440
perfect continue so what I was saying be

1449
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:38,600
immediate threats would be the threats

1450
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:41,550
that could come up so we can filter

1451
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:46,050
through the types of threats on a given

1452
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:48,660
hour of the day so maybe we just want to

1453
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:50,700
see the attack on the web vector so I

1454
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:54,210
select them I realize an attack and I'll

1455
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:56,519
see what the results are there you have

1456
01:37:54,210 --> 01:38:00,840
a description of the ransomware

1457
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:02,940
of their date and these are cases that

1458
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:04,710
come up and they're these people

1459
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:07,650
incorporating them into their

1460
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:12,870
application and they're pretty

1461
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:19,349
up-to-date they're modules here through

1462
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:24,540
gateway attacks over time report we can

1463
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:31,530
see the reports here although we don't

1464
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:33,840
have much time left so anyway this is

1465
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:36,719
this is the tool without saying it's

1466
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:39,690
very good it gives a lot of information

1467
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:43,080
and the implementation that they have

1468
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:46,290
done with mitre is very important they

1469
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:50,070
also have an API with which it

1470
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:51,990
integrates with many services and it has

1471
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:53,969
a module with Splunk which I saw the

1472
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:56,820
other day we haven't tested it yet or if

1473
01:38:53,970 --> 01:39:05,850
it looks good it takes you directly to

1474
01:38:56,820 --> 01:39:07,070
mitre references and it filters data say

1475
01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:09,739
you want to

1476
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:13,460
test whether your organization is ready

1477
01:39:09,739 --> 01:39:18,348
for data leaks through Dropbox or email

1478
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:22,670
you to schedule here and you just launch

1479
01:39:18,349 --> 01:39:33,380
it on the machine that has their agent

1480
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:35,869
installed see and here we've got all the

1481
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:42,590
tests but we didn't really have time now

1482
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:45,049
so well let's just pause here and just

1483
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:50,119
to see if it has worked no I'm not

1484
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:52,969
working and this is the last tool that

1485
01:39:50,119 --> 01:39:55,369
we had full attack simulation that wants

1486
01:39:52,969 --> 01:39:59,449
to show you we can talk about this later

1487
01:39:55,369 --> 01:40:02,630
when we're done and we have created all

1488
01:39:59,449 --> 01:40:04,820
right infrastructure we have launched

1489
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:07,849
our attacks we have analyzed or attacks

1490
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:11,989
we have visualized them on Splunk see

1491
01:40:07,849 --> 01:40:14,869
what they do and because we are thread

1492
01:40:11,989 --> 01:40:17,468
hunters now we have to dump all that

1493
01:40:14,869 --> 01:40:20,420
information on a label

1494
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:23,349
hence register everything that we have

1495
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:25,929
been doing so what do I do we create one

1496
01:40:23,349 --> 01:40:29,900
template like the one you see here

1497
01:40:25,929 --> 01:40:32,960
you've got your data was created who

1498
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:36,230
created it how long you reckon this is

1499
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:40,820
going to take the priority they ask for

1500
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:42,500
the organization then we start writing

1501
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:44,630
the hypothesis that we mentioned at the

1502
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:54,440
beginning that the phases different

1503
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:56,770
triggers that my create a thread we've

1504
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:59,210
been talking about execution on

1505
01:40:56,770 --> 01:41:04,940
PowerShell so you've got a identified

1506
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:07,579
here with 10 10 82 and 86 then we

1507
01:41:04,940 --> 01:41:09,530
describe technique which is very good

1508
01:41:07,579 --> 01:41:13,820
it's very helpful for ourselves as well

1509
01:41:09,530 --> 01:41:15,739
then some techniques that you can find

1510
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:17,608
within that could make now a very

1511
01:41:15,739 --> 01:41:20,280
interesting part

1512
01:41:17,609 --> 01:41:25,709
threat intelligence as you can see there

1513
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:27,839
at the top which is the study but it

1514
01:41:25,709 --> 01:41:31,229
depends on who is hiring you say it is

1515
01:41:27,839 --> 01:41:35,550
finance banks energy company so I'm

1516
01:41:31,229 --> 01:41:39,239
going to focus on the threats that might

1517
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:42,179
attack them so I go on mitre I check

1518
01:41:39,239 --> 01:41:45,358
that group and I write it down here I

1519
01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:49,429
even write the kind of software they use

1520
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:53,459
whether they have active campaigns the

1521
01:41:49,429 --> 01:41:55,499
capability that that actor has so all

1522
01:41:53,459 --> 01:41:59,999
the information about threat attention

1523
01:41:55,499 --> 01:42:03,659
we really like and then we go on to the

1524
01:41:59,999 --> 01:42:05,489
next part which is data source where am

1525
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:07,919
I getting that information if it's

1526
01:42:05,489 --> 01:42:11,518
PowerShell but obviously it depends on

1527
01:42:07,919 --> 01:42:14,369
the organization so I need to know how

1528
01:42:11,519 --> 01:42:16,589
my organization works and I can see

1529
01:42:14,369 --> 01:42:19,259
where I can get information from if it's

1530
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:21,179
not through if I can not see it on

1531
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:23,789
PowerShell and I cannot get information

1532
01:42:21,179 --> 01:42:25,829
I try to adjust different searches but

1533
01:42:23,789 --> 01:42:29,909
it would be minimal I wouldn't have the

1534
01:42:25,829 --> 01:42:32,398
full picture so we just enter all the

1535
01:42:29,909 --> 01:42:38,329
information here what needs to be

1536
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:41,489
monitored all the actions that we take

1537
01:42:38,329 --> 01:42:44,669
every day so this is key we have to

1538
01:42:41,489 --> 01:42:47,518
write on that day I created a lab I gave

1539
01:42:44,669 --> 01:42:51,749
it this configuration then I did certain

1540
01:42:47,519 --> 01:42:54,679
such tests I focused on a critical event

1541
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:57,269
so on and so forth so I just basically

1542
01:42:54,679 --> 01:43:00,149
put in here everything that I find every

1543
01:42:57,269 --> 01:43:03,149
day and finally the mitigations that we

1544
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:06,570
think can be then transmitted on to the

1545
01:43:03,149 --> 01:43:13,739
next group who are going to analyze it

1546
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:15,570
and see the case study and finally on

1547
01:43:13,739 --> 01:43:18,119
the conditions were right whether the

1548
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:21,419
hypothesis has been confirmed or not all

1549
01:43:18,119 --> 01:43:23,429
partially this is the initial phase and

1550
01:43:21,419 --> 01:43:27,689
there will be another face this is how

1551
01:43:23,429 --> 01:43:29,939
we enrich our work we write a few notes

1552
01:43:27,689 --> 01:43:34,969
we deem it necessary

1553
01:43:29,939 --> 01:43:39,110
and so I play book for threat hunting is

1554
01:43:34,969 --> 01:43:41,039
now conclusions that will drawn

1555
01:43:39,110 --> 01:43:45,449
obviously you will draw your own

1556
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:47,188
conclusions but for us I personally

1557
01:43:45,449 --> 01:43:51,058
haven't been doing threat hunting for a

1558
01:43:47,189 --> 01:43:54,179
long time studied in July to do research

1559
01:43:51,059 --> 01:43:56,760
break the laboratory work with it

1560
01:43:54,179 --> 01:44:00,209
see services and I think this is

1561
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:02,789
absolutely amazing I think it is the

1562
01:44:00,209 --> 01:44:05,729
kind of job where you need to know

1563
01:44:02,789 --> 01:44:07,978
technically many many areas and we come

1564
01:44:05,729 --> 01:44:11,789
from a forensics background but if we

1565
01:44:07,979 --> 01:44:17,820
have the salt picture of what the attack

1566
01:44:11,789 --> 01:44:19,860
is from when it starts how it happens

1567
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:22,558
makes you grow as a professional and

1568
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:27,089
that's why I like the most about it here

1569
01:44:22,559 --> 01:44:30,419
you have quite a few resources these all

1570
01:44:27,090 --> 01:44:33,510
the resources that we have used during

1571
01:44:30,419 --> 01:44:36,559
this workshop you can see they have

1572
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:44,459
detection lab that you have their

1573
01:44:36,559 --> 01:44:46,860
Twitter accounts as well and you can

1574
01:44:44,459 --> 01:44:49,289
find there all the information you can

1575
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:52,139
check their everything sometimes even if

1576
01:44:49,289 --> 01:44:55,530
you have questions they might answer now

1577
01:44:52,139 --> 01:44:59,999
you also have links for sis Minh what we

1578
01:44:55,530 --> 01:45:03,719
have taken the configuration from but he

1579
01:44:59,999 --> 01:45:07,610
also have modular says Minh and system X

1580
01:45:03,719 --> 01:45:10,409
as well which is currently on beta

1581
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:12,869
version but it has a lot of potential

1582
01:45:10,409 --> 01:45:17,638
Michael Savio is responsible for we know

1583
01:45:12,869 --> 01:45:20,070
him I'm checking when he is updating it

1584
01:45:17,639 --> 01:45:22,289
to try and work with their way you have

1585
01:45:20,070 --> 01:45:25,679
everything we've talked about Sigma much

1586
01:45:22,289 --> 01:45:29,099
more in-depth for example the the

1587
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:32,159
translator that we mentioned before

1588
01:45:29,099 --> 01:45:35,849
reference to virtual machines to you

1589
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:37,978
mitre to caldera and all the information

1590
01:45:35,849 --> 01:45:38,820
that overthrow that he gave leaves there

1591
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:42,810
on Fred

1592
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:44,610
so we are running out of time this is

1593
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:47,280
the end of it thank you so so much for

1594
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:50,370
being here and over the time wasn't the

1595
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:51,809
best I know the business very intensive

1596
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:54,180
workshop but thank you thank you very

1597
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:56,820
much and I have any questions were here

1598
01:45:54,180 --> 01:46:00,330
to answer round of applause for them

1599
01:45:56,820 --> 01:46:03,719
please you've got contact details as

1600
01:46:00,330 --> 01:46:05,790
well if you need anything just anyone

1601
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:10,110
have any questions or Lorien and the

1602
01:46:05,790 --> 01:46:16,260
carlo's we've got one question there on

1603
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:18,480
the back great and in any case we're

1604
01:46:16,260 --> 01:46:20,190
going to be around if you have a very

1605
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:23,490
deep question at some point we can have

1606
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:27,719
a coffee right outside well

1607
01:46:23,490 --> 01:46:29,309
congratulations on your workshop I was

1608
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:33,870
wondering because you mentioned that

1609
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:36,300
Splunk use a specific tool but you

1610
01:46:33,870 --> 01:46:39,540
haven't agent we haven't said which one

1611
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:44,190
you've used for Ellis K which which ones

1612
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:45,960
have you used and why yes because this

1613
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:49,620
was pre configured on the virtual

1614
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:52,040
machine so it is not us implementing it

1615
01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:57,059
but rather that it came by default in

1616
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:59,370
big chart that we've shown you we didn't

1617
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:01,530
want to go into detail to give you a

1618
01:46:59,370 --> 01:47:07,530
reference so you can then look into it

1619
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:09,780
with more detail but have you tried yeah

1620
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:15,120
I have heard about what fool I haven't

1621
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:20,130
tried it thank you whatever we color

1622
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:22,110
look any more questions around here as I

1623
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:23,520
was saying we're going to be out here we

1624
01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:32,910
can have a coffee with you if you want

1625
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:36,060
to no problem well Surya I was wondering

1626
01:47:32,910 --> 01:47:37,590
what the most portable would be and

1627
01:47:36,060 --> 01:47:44,340
which one you could take to other

1628
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:47,160
platforms just say with raspberry for to

1629
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:51,080
take for developing development teams

1630
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:53,809
and work teams take into account

1631
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:56,900
these environments because we are

1632
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:59,140
launching Aquarius which needs quite a

1633
01:47:56,900 --> 01:48:04,910
lot of resources such as eight Giga

1634
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:07,460
ramps what I would recommend is help

1635
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:09,290
that is the minimum requirements

1636
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:11,390
it has different modules you can

1637
01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:13,550
configure the biggest one which needs a

1638
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:21,710
lot of resources or the minimal which

1639
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:26,090
has AIDS but also if you can have high

1640
01:48:21,710 --> 01:48:29,300
resources you can always do it on the

1641
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:35,600
ground and then usually meet the many

1642
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:38,030
resources for your computer section and

1643
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,500
for us the next thing we're going to do

1644
01:48:38,030 --> 01:48:41,929
is implement it on Amazon for example

1645
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:46,580
and you can do it easily in the cloud

1646
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:49,430
yeah just with the account that Amazon

1647
01:48:46,580 --> 01:48:50,930
gives you which is free by the way you

1648
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:53,150
can choose to have that infrastructure

1649
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:57,080
we've got limited time off you see

1650
01:48:53,150 --> 01:49:01,179
because otherwise it costs a lot of

1651
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:03,410
money but yeah you could do it thank you

1652
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:06,260
any more questions I don't know we have

1653
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:13,639
time yes we do have time if someone else

1654
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:17,330
has a question thank you so so much for

1655
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:19,050
being in I become 2019 please a round of

1656
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:26,510
