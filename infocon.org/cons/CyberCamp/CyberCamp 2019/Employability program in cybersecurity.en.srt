event for accompanying and fermenting

58
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,269
the program that we're going to talk

59
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,450
about today the program from play built

60
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:51,389
in cybersecurity an opportunity for

61
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:55,638
businesses and the disabled we've spoken

62
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:58,530
about the fact that cybersecurity is

63
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:01,709
really important currently and this is

64
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,440
an activity that is indeed got many

65
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,169
opportunities in terms of employment it

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,590
will grow over the coming years there is

67
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:12,050
a great deal of activities

68
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,629
amantha problem into a mucho and this

69
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,310
creates the demand of different types of

70
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,709
profiles or many different kinds of

71
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:22,400
qualifications different types of skills

72
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:27,979
and these are great reasons to have an

73
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:31,580
employability program out and for an

74
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:34,990
organization such as ours to do

75
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,849
something special good job Foundation

76
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,070
something special for people who have

77
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:44,000
disabilities it's saying okay there are

78
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:47,210
opportunities here and why not when I

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,479
spoke to in thei Bay about this and I

80
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:53,599
say Ramon is also a part of this and

81
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,510
ferments this project we realized and we

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,540
thought we have to do something from the

83
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:02,210
good job Foundation let me tell a little

84
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,010
bit more about us we are not related to

85
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,250
cybersecurity we have no idea about

86
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:10,849
cybersecurity but we do know a little

87
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:13,729
bit about employability and disabled we

88
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:18,229
are an NGO and we do with people who

89
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:23,960
have disabilities we focus on

90
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:27,789
employability and disabilities so we

91
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,049
feel like we have to shall we say to

92
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:32,330
talk about the issues that we're going

93
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,970
to talk about here today cybersecurity

94
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,700
is a huge opportunity opportunity for

95
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:39,710
people with disabilities and we talked

96
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:46,099
about this in the foundation and we

97
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:48,609
thought should we say we put things on

98
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:50,960
the table and as we were talking

99
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,669
including to the people who are here

100
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,080
with us today including in a case

101
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:58,969
Sanchez everybody was saying whirling

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,409
it's clear it's obvious how obviously

103
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,889
we're going to do this it's very very

104
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:07,729
clear there were several reasons for

105
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:11,479
that and I'd like to talk about the part

106
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:14,719
that I'm more familiar with reasons and

107
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,250
for disabilities and so on and then

108
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,860
we'll talk about about the opportunities

109
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:23,640
the objective of the program is

110
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:30,450
to open up opportunities for people who

111
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:32,400
have disabilities to find jobs so the

112
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:35,610
people with disabilities can find stable

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:42,260
jobs in the field of cybersecurity and

114
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:46,650
to identify and ferment the capabilities

115
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:48,420
within this field taking into account

116
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,690
different levels of employability

117
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,550
different levels of support and

118
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:56,430
different kinds of positions in

119
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,580
companies so one of the things we said

120
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:03,720
was that cybersecurity requires any a

121
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:06,030
great deal of number of tasks so we need

122
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:11,820
people who are different types of

123
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:15,570
capabilities probably people who have

124
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:18,390
disabilities who are very very good

125
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:21,000
dealing with certain areas of of

126
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,729
cybersecurity and since this is growing

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,740
it's the time to do it and so we were

128
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:30,900
decided to go along with this project

129
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,370
create an employability program in

130
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,080
cybersecurity for people with

131
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:41,070
disabilities let me talk a little bit

132
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:45,630
about what it's all about the focus of

133
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:47,969
the program is try and tell a little bit

134
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:51,630
about how we're dealing with this it's

135
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:54,900
aimed at people with a disability it has

136
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:57,090
no cost for the participants it's

137
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,310
something that we do that we're going to

138
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:03,330
do from the organizations that are

139
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:07,860
involved the idea is for it to be 100

140
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:11,219
people when it is born in 2020 and it

141
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,500
goes ahead and we will deal with people

142
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,320
who have disabilities but would like to

143
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,460
work in technology who are searching for

144
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,680
job opportunities and are able to apply

145
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:26,549
themselves to the field of cybersecurity

146
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,630
and to have training that is not just

147
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,960
the standard training not just

148
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,958
certification

149
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,689
in computing we're not talking about

150
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:39,949
masters and other interesting crossing

151
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:42,300
courses but it's aimed at people who

152
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,660
maybe don't have a great deal of

153
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,040
training but have the vocation and

154
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,130
capabilities depending on the types of

155
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,899
opportunities that are available we will

156
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,339
give to training courses in Madrid and

157
00:08:51,899 --> 00:09:02,070
Leone we want this to be a scalable

158
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:03,589
project so that we can identify the best

159
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,290
way and the best way of doing that is

160
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:08,970
experiment we're going to have two

161
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,550
different dimensions

162
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,339
we'll have to pilot training courses

163
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:17,130
Madrid and Leone one will be a bit

164
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:21,690
shorter than one be a bit longer in both

165
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:24,720
cities and following that those training

166
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:27,899
courses or at the same time we will

167
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,700
identify the skills that these people

168
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:35,520
have companies that have opportunities

169
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,649
and there have the option of taking

170
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:42,899
these people on on a professional role

171
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:46,500
and incorporating them into there so

172
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,029
it's not a commercial search so that

173
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,149
they can end up working in a particular

174
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:53,220
business there will be five people

175
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:56,399
giving support in Madrid five people

176
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,170
giving support in Leone these are

177
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,390
technicians in employability they have a

178
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,370
great deal of knowledge in terms of

179
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:07,050
employment for disability people with

180
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:09,690
disabilities and each person will do

181
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:12,240
with a specific area of each of the

182
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:19,440
different participants and help to

183
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:21,209
orient them when a person starts working

184
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,360
in a different profession we find

185
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:27,089
talents find skills that even those

186
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,760
present didn't know about and will find

187
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,860
us in the field of cybersecurity so

188
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:38,220
those are the main parameters of the

189
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:41,100
program we want to train people's will

190
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,740
be better than us but what we want is a

191
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,209
global vision

192
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:49,010
with a general Nile so that people you

193
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,930
have a disability you don't have a

194
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:54,740
doctorate don't have an engineering

195
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:57,500
degree or higher level education but do

196
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,770
have a vacation and do want to end up in

197
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:05,510
this professional field so that we can

198
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:07,670
give them the opportunity to do that and

199
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,709
before we get into the technical side of

200
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,660
where what training course is how to do

201
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:14,560
this

202
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:21,649
also like to talk a little bit about

203
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:24,140
disability why it's even necessary that

204
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:27,410
we need to have a specific program for

205
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:33,470
people with disabilities talking about

206
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:36,189
numbers 1 million eight hundred thousand

207
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,860
people in Spain who have a disability

208
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:43,370
these are people of working age and out

209
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:50,270
of them people who are working or

210
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:52,160
searching 35 people out of every 100

211
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:57,500
people so these people are either

212
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,060
working or looking for work but however

213
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:02,570
in the field of disabilities for 20

214
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,239
bucks is 78 out of every 100 people who

215
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:11,660
are working age they are looking for

216
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:16,370
work we're talking about a more of a

217
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:18,829
social model in this particular case but

218
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,760
these figures give an indication of the

219
00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:21,760
field that were working with

220
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,399
there is about 23 24 percent of people

221
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,200
who are unemployed whereas the figures

222
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,940
are a lot lower people who don't have a

223
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:36,950
disability 15 16 % so this is another

224
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:41,450
indication of why we need to focus on

225
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:43,970
this field and to give people incentives

226
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,500
to people and we talked about women in

227
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,060
cybersecurity before and it's a little

228
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:53,150
bit the same in this field so what

229
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,270
characteristics what are the profiles of

230
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,990
the people with

231
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:03,149
disabilities some people have a physical

232
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:07,920
disability 25% people have a mental

233
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:10,320
disability or develop this disabilities

234
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,599
and other people have permanent

235
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,810
disabilities if somebody's had an

236
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,860
accident work and can't continue in

237
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:22,640
their line of work they end up having a

238
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:24,630
status of disability and part about 15%

239
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,569
so what are they characters

240
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:31,130
characteristics of these people so only

241
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:34,950
a small number of people have a degree

242
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:38,010
some have higher education and then we

243
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,020
get into primary education and a small

244
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:44,430
percentage of people who don't have any

245
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:46,439
education at all there are a lot of

246
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,120
people who are with a disability or

247
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:52,410
looking for work who don't have higher

248
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:56,430
education the people who do have higher

249
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:58,920
education a degree or Master really have

250
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:02,880
a great deal of number of options within

251
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:07,640
the field of employment it's very

252
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:11,939
important for employment to be inclusive

253
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:16,980
75 out of every hundred jobs that are

254
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:20,279
offered here in Spain go through

255
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,800
agencies but businesses aren't out there

256
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,589
offering themselves to the people with

257
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,099
disabilities we believe that there are

258
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:31,650
many companies that are not special

259
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,480
agencies employability do you have

260
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:38,069
opportunities in the companies and we

261
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:42,390
can incentivize people to work in their

262
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:44,940
fields and work in these companies this

263
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:50,310
way we'll have more inclusive employment

264
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:52,110
in the country legislation so that

265
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:54,479
people needs to have people with

266
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,120
disabilities working for them but the

267
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:02,800
offer available out there does not meet

268
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:07,649
the demand in cybersecurity and in other

269
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,839
in Madrid we're not talking about rolls

270
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:14,110
anybody can do if you don't have the

271
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,989
appropriate appropriate training so

272
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:20,670
these are all the different reasons that

273
00:15:16,989 --> 00:15:23,199
justify why we have positive

274
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,569
discrimination and an employability

275
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:31,118
program focuses on people with a

276
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:33,219
disability it's not about people with a

277
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:35,589
disability with the best training to put

278
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,299
them into this program we're talking

279
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:44,399
about people with disabilities who are

280
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:47,649
looking for a job they have a disability

281
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,249
this is this is quite common in the

282
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:53,949
field of working of work people all of a

283
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:55,660
sudden are in a situation in which they

284
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:57,339
have a disability and we have to deal

285
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,779
with people and give opportunities

286
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:00,779
people who come across this situation

287
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,579
therefore it makes a lot of sense that

288
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:09,879
we set up this program we can help

289
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:11,589
people who really know what they want to

290
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,269
do and clear about that we didn't have

291
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,149
the sufficient training to enter enter

292
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:18,220
into this sector but we can orient them

293
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:20,499
and they can find out about technology

294
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,720
and if we are able to help them and

295
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:24,399
orient them and see and let them see

296
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,019
that they have an opportunity in this

297
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,980
field we can accompany them in that

298
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:32,860
entire process because these people

299
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,470
might find that they are not successful

300
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,049
during the selection process the hiring

301
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:41,649
process and this is so I wanted to help

302
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:49,809
them get to the end and the program will

303
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:53,639
accompany people we can work with those

304
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:56,559
situations and find stable employment in

305
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,230
regular companies for people with

306
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:04,089
disabilities and this is a little bit of

307
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:06,880
the objective of this program and a

308
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:10,759
little bit the idea and the approach

309
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:15,269
that we have yeah

310
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:17,099
I would like to focus now on I would

311
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,870
like to talk to people who here with me

312
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:25,519
because one we started thinking about

313
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:25,518
this together because good job did

314
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:33,629
training in cybersecurity but we have a

315
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,970
maximum of 50 15 people who would get

316
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,830
into jobs a year so we thought there's

317
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,309
something we're not doing right and this

318
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:47,490
is where Rahman came along all came

319
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:49,320
along this was in pre-k company that's

320
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:56,639
where we saw where the accelerators

321
00:17:49,320 --> 00:18:05,850
could be so I'd like to open the debate

322
00:17:56,639 --> 00:18:12,149
and I invite you all to what people even

323
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:15,480
know what training what specific

324
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:19,258
training they should and in order to get

325
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:24,899
stable jobs they said in the beginning

326
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:26,519
of the professional is it possible for

327
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:29,189
people to get to the top of cyber

328
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,600
security or is it an office at for us to

329
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,399
just help people to access the job

330
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,668
market and accompany those who want to

331
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:38,639
get to the top but let those who do not

332
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:43,710
want to get to the top do whatever they

333
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:51,658
want to do look at us are you willing to

334
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:54,720
say something so please go ahead I would

335
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:59,039
like to take you back to 1991 when I

336
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:05,519
said is working with me and it's funny

337
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:09,899
cuz my first modem I bought from when he

338
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:12,330
had computer shop in bio just so you get

339
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:17,539
an idea of the world we're talking about

340
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,539
so I said it connecting to BBS

341
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:26,690
and I got 150 thousand pesetas invoice

342
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:29,510
and my mum got really really upset with

343
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,850
that going in touch with people who

344
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,910
we're into hacking which at the time was

345
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:38,570
 trying to get at train toots

346
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,580
Abba into the phone and pay as little as

347
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:45,950
possible

348
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:50,629
I locked lines get on page box which is

349
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:54,910
what we had here in Spain one day I got

350
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:58,550
connected to L Souls BBS was about three

351
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:00,470
walking around if you haven't seen their

352
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,110
BBS you won't have any idea what I'm

353
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,900
talking about but just imagine you have

354
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:08,479
little text boxes all around the screen

355
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,430
and it took a while for the whole scream

356
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:16,030
to have text and then you'd get on to

357
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,030
the forum and the same boxes and then

358
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,330
slowly I'm real excited

359
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,440
nevertheless because it was my first

360
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:39,919
time I start getting to know virtually

361
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,100
obviously I don't know if on the other

362
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:53,480
side I have a dog that character dragon

363
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:57,500
man a woman a tomboy anything this

364
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,270
person invites me to just picture I was

365
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,120
17 at the time so I had to go from

366
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,310
photographer to a little sound really

367
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,800
really far away so I look for buses I

368
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:09,950
look for means of getting there and when

369
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,440
I get into this man's house I see the

370
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:15,350
business and man who is in bed and can

371
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:19,300
only moved his wrists a tiny little bit

372
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,300
and so he had created

373
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:25,520
accessories with little sticks that

374
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:28,320
would have helped him write on his

375
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,529
keyboard he had created this BBS he

376
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,658
created an investment firm he had done

377
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:35,730
remotely and that's when I realized the

378
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,009
amount of things you can and cannot do

379
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:40,380
and this is really the criteria that I

380
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:41,880
always use when someone says I cannot do

381
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:48,389
it this man was called fun and learn

382
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:51,120
that he was BBS and then I understood

383
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:53,309
two main things first of all on the

384
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,379
other side of the screen you don't have

385
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:59,129
to care who you have because there's

386
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:06,809
someone doing doesn't matter if it's

387
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:10,200
someone worth they are capable of doing

388
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:14,009
many many things in the world and by

389
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:17,399
themselves regardless of what that

390
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:20,460
person is like no one can have aesthetic

391
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:23,518
and absurd limitations in their lives

392
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:27,500
and something that I only get in touch

393
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:31,019
with people who fit the idea that I have

394
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:34,320
and when she was saying a lady can be a

395
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:41,700
woman hacker today it's strange I have

396
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:43,200
been looking all my life through the

397
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,519
other side if in second life do you

398
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,139
remember you could interact with

399
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:50,519
advertise you didn't know if it was a

400
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:54,689
man or a woman you only saw the avatar

401
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:57,629
and in infield which has a lot to do

402
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,120
with merits and what you do it's

403
00:22:57,629 --> 00:23:02,219
wonderful because I don't need to know

404
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,090
what you are you can be whatever you are

405
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,950
just work and produce work and that's

406
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,539
the only thing that matters and this is

407
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,250
why I thought this was a wonderful

408
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,559
opportunity first of all because I feel

409
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,850
an emotional link with it but also

410
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,950
because I really think it's an

411
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,990
opportunity to show how we can do things

412
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:25,230
well when it comes to inclusion and

413
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:28,110
integration saying regarding contents we

414
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:34,529
have to be pragmatic with this we want

415
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:38,629
to achieve results and in the show David

416
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:40,880
is coming from telefónica and welcome

417
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,830
here as well and these are two companies

418
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,510
who have decided to work with us from

419
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:49,760
the word go and they are really working

420
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:53,360
for this to work it cannot be an excuse

421
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,750
for people with disabilities to end up

422
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,520
in ghettos because when thinking about

423
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:03,290
someone with a disability

424
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:06,139
checking socks and lies I'm really sorry

425
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:10,190
I've got a very colorful language but I

426
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:13,640
want to say the visitors it's very

427
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:16,220
good to start but someone with a

428
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:20,450
disability can be able to manage Red

429
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:23,330
Team teams can do forensic digital

430
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,430
forensics they can do just everything

431
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,889
that anyone can do because it has

432
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,990
nothing to do with their disability this

433
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:33,670
is essential yes we'll have to be

434
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,670
pragmatic we have to start getting

435
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:41,060
training them and we have to build a

436
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:44,149
path for them growing understand being

437
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,730
in different positions and here actually

438
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,220
giving talks and telling us all what

439
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:51,440
happened during their Korean how they

440
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,180
got where they are so companies they

441
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,470
Western what they need right now they

442
00:24:53,180 --> 00:25:00,950
have perimeter security they had lost

443
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,080
correlations they had many platforms and

444
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,610
they would need an inventory and there

445
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,860
is essential for them and maybe we

446
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,949
should work along those lines for

447
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:14,990
training because all in me I believe who

448
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:16,520
are helping along with us from eBay was

449
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,290
actually saying during a meeting and

450
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,710
some will do one in the long term but

451
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:27,320
let's about with specific steps in the

452
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:29,210
first two quarters of next year you will

453
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,419
welcome me because they are the

454
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:35,060
companies that are working with us which

455
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:38,390
doesn't mean that I'll go in three years

456
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:41,830
is we have 8,000 workers with

457
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:46,940
disabilities who do really cool things

458
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:48,980
well there's no need to explain how much

459
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,090
Roman is really helping the situation

460
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,740
and to talk about his

461
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:55,889
father but I would like to link this

462
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,810
with what he said about Western and the

463
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:02,310
role that companies play in this we have

464
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:04,800
two levels of companies some we don't

465
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:08,909
know right now that we hope are going to

466
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,290
be companies who take in people with

467
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,240
disabilities that take part in this

468
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,240
program and then other type of companies

469
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,100
who have started to work with us from

470
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,630
the word go and say no I am really

471
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,439
interested and I want this now I don't

472
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,970
want to wait

473
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,610
I don't want for this to take forever

474
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:25,830
and so I'm going to mention two

475
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,449
different situations but which I think

476
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,850
are complementary to each other because

477
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:35,520
we have a very diverse team and very

478
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:38,250
interesting as well it's all about

479
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:45,389
feedback amongst isn't it yeah for

480
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:47,220
example I met him and I mentioned this

481
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:48,900
and it took him literally fifteen

482
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,720
seconds to say no I'm interested in a

483
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,030
want to partake so these companies that

484
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,430
are on this first level they want to

485
00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:00,889
hire people with disabilities as soon as

486
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:06,240
possible and they want to be catalyzing

487
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:11,550
about companies Enriquez you already

488
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:16,730
have hired people with disabilities in

489
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:20,550
the foundation taken certificate in

490
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:23,580
computing security that we offer with

491
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:26,490
the cooperation of the foundation and so

492
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:31,490
we have a beginning for those people who

493
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:31,490
are already working in their company

494
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:39,450
interesting three months they're going

495
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,860
to train them on what a company does but

496
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,650
at the same time we're going to start

497
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:49,820
looking into where they could go within

498
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:54,140
the company depending on what they said

499
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,139
well good we want to take part in this

500
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,570
everyone feels proud of having

501
00:30:44,330 --> 00:31:10,789
it's sort of out

502
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,800
[Music]

503
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:59,300
making them which is also transparent

504
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,220
where no one knows what's behind that

505
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:05,440
rip team who are we well there you go

506
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,440
and you know

507
00:33:19,200 --> 00:34:34,250
I want to

508
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:23,180
no specifically you know each of you

509
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,180
could think

510
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,359
[Music]

511
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,629
[Music]

512
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:36,339
people with autism as well they can do

513
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:36,339
magic with

514
00:39:38,660 --> 00:41:35,299
I think you need to have all types

515
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:39,390
advantages but we need to maintain

516
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:47,299
commitment over time at least in the mid

517
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:47,299
term at least talk next

518
00:41:47,970 --> 00:42:05,069
20 I think it's the basis of what we're

519
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,960
talking about I think it's a question of

520
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:09,450
attitude our experience is very

521
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:17,609
important it's essential to work on that

522
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:19,830
but attitude secrecy in a law based on

523
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:33,720
my personal experience if you believe in

524
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:38,369
something you create cyber camp you can

525
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:48,270
see that really living it no I mean the

526
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:51,390
people truly believe main pillars one

527
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:55,650
way or another of Technology and they're

528
00:42:51,390 --> 00:43:02,609
also so how do you reach with your

529
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:05,250
public in doing games appear to reach

530
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:15,420
and get closer to our audience and that

531
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:17,900
knowledge is not available in other

532
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:20,970
sectors and that's the community

533
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:26,930
community is a community that shares

534
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:26,930
their knowledge in a different kind of

535
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:40,170
unity to things that I've enjoyed and

536
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,589
have factors such as hackerspaces

537
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,950
this is an international community gets

538
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:45,950
together

539
00:43:47,890 --> 00:44:21,069
and in sharing knowledge in many of them

540
00:44:24,279 --> 00:45:56,230
here in Spain if we're talking about

541
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:19,970
for this opportunity

542
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,610
[Music]

543
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:13,260
this is a specialist for integration

544
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:16,649

545
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:20,100
cybersecurity and using people's skills

546
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:21,720
and this is what it's all about talking

547
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:30,299
about this program we're talking about

548
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:32,689
the importance testing information what

549
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:39,120
people strain without saying than that

550
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:42,720
and we want to get to that but I'd also

551
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:45,890
like to mention today another aspect

552
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,890
which is the supportive

553
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,519
