00:02:12,330 --> 00:03:44,319
is going to be very happy from here we

6
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,608
will have excellent tool so we do a

7
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,950
great service to well those of you here

8
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:57,120
before know what this is about but

9
00:03:50,950 --> 00:04:02,000
hackathon is on site and collaborative

10
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,660
competition to develop to security and

11
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,630
yeah this is only the beginning that you

12
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,960
leave here not only to improve you to to

13
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,329
improve your knowledge as well relieved

14
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,299
with the idea but in the little time we

15
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,970
have here this plants a seed but will

16
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,400
then be avoided go from here and from

17
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,350
the rest of the community so as really

18
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,280
here we make efforts to make sure that

19
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,410
this happens and one of the aims is to

20
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:36,340
this competition to attract be interest

21
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:39,290
be part of the chain that attracts

22
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,440
talent at a national level which is what

23
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,300
we're trying to do from Phoebus so the

24
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,710
jury will be able to introduce

25
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:51,169
themselves later but from us thank you

26
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:56,270
so much you work a lot but believe that

27
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:58,130
those jury do have to put in loads of

28
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,530
hours they are very high level

29
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:03,740
professionals were very happy to be able

30
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:07,969
to count them into our project this year

31
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:13,280
we have javier marcos - join the jury as

32
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:18,919
well this initial part of the

33
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:26,239
introductions we call this number one

34
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:28,130
stage today but basically what every

35
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,110
team is going to do is have an initial

36
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:38,990
presentation or they will have eight

37
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:41,960
minutes the order of presentation you

38
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,290
will have to send your to when you come

39
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,799
to the stage you will talk about

40
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:52,460
functionalities and capabilities bring

41
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,650
in what how the cyber security community

42
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,539
can benefit and anything that you find

43
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,580
so basically you just have to sell

44
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,630
stupid speaker because this

45
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,419
Stage one although it's not as important

46
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,430
as the other stages of course but it's

47
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,640
always important that you know how to

48
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,890
defend your project and that you are

49
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,130
able to tell in it was very realistic

50
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,900
way were you coming here to do and then

51
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,909
compare it with what you don't

52
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,580
eventually so what we're going to value

53
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,780
is the application of your proposal

54
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,640
originality quality of the presentation

55
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,489
answers to questions that today's all

56
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,240
about breaking the ice for many of us

57
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,550
the first time you're very nervous don't

58
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,800
worry so much because what comes out of

59
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,610
this presentation in order to be decided

60
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:48,770
on the result of the hackathons so do

61
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:53,090
not worry about that so the order of not

62
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,919
means updated but they they know

63
00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:02,090
themselves who was the first team raise

64
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:04,580
your hands here team number two then as

65
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,229
soon as they are finishing with that

66
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:12,380
time you have to be able to come on to

67
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:14,170
the stage we've done in the last two

68
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,030
editions the panel is going to be

69
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:19,700
anonymized we're not going to give good

70
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,309
marks today stage wants that's with the

71
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,219
presentations but it's going to last

72
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,130
throughout tomorrow as well

73
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,990
and the junior will come around to see

74
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,409
you and to ask you questions to see how

75
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:38,090
you're focusing your proposal and that's

76
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:45,170
where the final marks will come from we

77
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:47,869
will say position the teams code but

78
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:51,110
we're going to show either the marks or

79
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:54,620
any other information allows to identify

80
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:58,040
who the team why because sometimes some

81
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,320
teams think that the world behind

82
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,530
another team and then it turns out that

83
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,450
actually they didn't have to be down

84
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:08,359
because of that because they could make

85
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:10,650
up for it in the end the author of the

86
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,039
final presentations will

87
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:16,870
directly the reverse of these first

88
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,938
presentations very soon have started

89
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,889
number ones today will be number 12

90
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:33,880
first final presentation since I want

91
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:36,940
and so forth we finish the presentations

92
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,760
we will go back to the hackathon room

93
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:45,459
just to continue with the questions two

94
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:48,149
teams before but the questions they need

95
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:51,099
to ask are the teams or Webby

96
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:56,170
those things will be bonus points to

97
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,700
what's cool and as you will see tomorrow

98
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,670
will show you the criteria you can even

99
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:08,110
reach 10% and then there will be bonus

100
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:09,640
bonus points tomorrow but as one of the

101
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,579
things that will give you a bonus point

102
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,890
is what do you add to the presentation

103
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:15,699
because we only can use this room until

104
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,660
8:00

105
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:25,449
we'll go afterwards to so we can

106
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:28,689
continue you can add anything if you've

107
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:30,790
already worked on something similar

108
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,000
you may even say oles didn't do this

109
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,219
because I've been there and it was crazy

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,100
maybe take this other approach because

111
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,630
we do value the spirit of community

112
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:46,720
which is what we basically want to

113
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:48,370
create Oh once we're done this if I knew

114
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,959
if you would like to come for a drink

115
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,660
afterwards so that we all get to know

116
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,560
each other better then I'll see you at

117
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,579
the end

118
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,579
good luck to everyone

119
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,250
it should be under L primera Kobashi of

120
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,740
t me yeah we can have the first team on

121
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,690
the stage to up to nice time now when it

122
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,490
comes to presentations you know that

123
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,500
you'll have your presentation ready here

124
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,430
they should be classified more or less

125
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,990
by name so you will be able to see

126
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,569
you've got the microphone here you can

127
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:28,070
share the time amongst yourselves as you

128
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:30,950
as you wish you also have come down here

129
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:36,649
for 10 minutes and we're going to have

130
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:38,029
to be strict with the time so we will

131
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:42,240
give you a little margin and the time

132
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:45,299
you have is 8 minutes by the way not 10

133
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,299
[Music]

134
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:53,899
the remote work Odyssey have if you want

135
00:10:51,110 --> 00:11:02,510
to advance you have to press down in

136
00:10:53,899 --> 00:11:03,829
order to press up to see you know good

137
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:08,360
afternoon everyone

138
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:10,550
so we have to be fast and good afternoon

139
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,690
to those of you who watching through

140
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:18,870
streaming we are - - - continues and we

141
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:20,170
want to introduce the tisiphone today

142
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:27,960
[Music]

143
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:30,189
our team had my favorite it's male we

144
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:39,980
[Music]

145
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:44,770
the research what excessive phone it's a

146
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:48,790
tool that it's going to comprise the

147
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:52,550
full dynamic security analysis in

148
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:56,959
continuous integration environment our

149
00:11:52,550 --> 00:12:01,120
objective is to have a global vision and

150
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:06,170
security before we start producing

151
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:09,720
automatically why have we thought about

152
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:12,250
this mostly because you

153
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,640
continuous integration environments we

154
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:19,390
have different tools to assess the

155
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:23,080
quality of code we have unit tests we

156
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:33,040
have different tools that help us to

157
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:36,310
check whether the coverage static but we

158
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:44,560
still needed some dynamic analysis we

159
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:48,069
were trying to achieve with the intent

160
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,520
what an auditor would do if they would

161
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:54,730
do a panel test and I'm saying intent or

162
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,589
a try just an approach because they have

163
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,459
many different tools but we think this

164
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:04,360
could be very beneficial and this is

165
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:07,660
aimed at all sorts audiences from

166
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,540
smaller companies with smaller budgets

167
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,620
as well that cannot afford to have a

168
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,390
final audit before starting production

169
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:20,320
or do not have time to do it with sis if

170
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:24,040
oh it would be very economic and they

171
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,190
would be able to companies and big teams

172
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:35,500
should actually run Sisyphus at night

173
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:40,930
during night build and so find a process

174
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:43,800
that would save a lot of time the pen

175
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,719
test stage when the also check something

176
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,579
finds a failure they have to check in so

177
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,580
with there is where we would do is

178
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:56,290
reduce all the time and of course save

179
00:13:51,580 --> 00:14:04,360
money we're going to have this

180
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:07,329
continuous integration with Gila pace

181
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:14,410
logging using one zap our idea is to

182
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:17,589
integrate as many tools as possible so

183
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:20,020
you have the most negatives there's

184
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,750
nobody we always have because these

185
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,180
tools cannot find all of them

186
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:26,790
if we have several children I was saying

187
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:31,250
then we could find as many as possible

188
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:33,329
and now I'm giving the floor to Holly

189
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,029
hello

190
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:40,589
well I'm going to talk about what we're

191
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:42,329
going to do during this we're going to

192
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:48,689
create a continuous integration

193
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:52,258
environment using get lab and we'll have

194
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:54,899
different stages the first ones will be

195
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:57,509
those that we kind of environment

196
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:02,839
completes on your code running unit

197
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:07,800
tests analyzing what static analysis and

198
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:11,269
so on and then what we do which is all

199
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:16,949
the dynamic analysis so running and

200
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:18,959
launching the dynamic analysis tool in

201
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:25,649
this stage what we're going to do is

202
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:29,729
have different jobs and in a docker

203
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:32,009
container in Linux infrastructure now

204
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:37,559
these containers will have all the tools

205
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:42,019
and we'll launch the attacks on the code

206
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,019
that we want to develop in production

207
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,980
able to configure the tools that they

208
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:56,100
want to use for example in this case

209
00:15:49,980 --> 00:16:01,550
we've used W peace can and Arachne and

210
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:04,290
then every two will have to go one

211
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,620
application why because they send a lot

212
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:10,559
of requests and if we launched all of

213
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,089
them at the same time then we wouldn't

214
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:16,949
be able to do the analysis because we

215
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:19,410
would always have failure now the tools

216
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:23,430
will also be able to be deployed in the

217
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:26,519
docker container and also in the

218
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,769
environment that they want that anyone

219
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,250
wants to deploy it now once this stage

220
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:34,050
is over we will do is have a final stage

221
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,899
where we will have

222
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:40,589
gathered all the results that these

223
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:43,709
tools give us and we'll have them in a

224
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:50,190
common area that it's understandable to

225
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:54,149
all of us we can then validate whether

226
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:56,430
the test of all the tools has what we

227
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:59,279
wanted it to do in order to validate

228
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:03,000
this test the developer will have to

229
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:07,679
configure a series of vulnerabilities

230
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,929
and tell us how many vulnerabilities the

231
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,439
test doesn't want we don't want the

232
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:15,209
tests to run so if we want where the

233
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,730
critical vulnerability for the test to

234
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:25,350
stop then we will have to configure it

235
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:27,839
in this job ones where we're done

236
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:30,030
mapping all the results for all the

237
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,800
tools that we have we will show the

238
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:37,710
developer is in deep lab environment is

239
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,950
all the vulnerabilities all the

240
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:45,390
weaknesses that we have found route by

241
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:48,210
type showing the security and the URL

242
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:51,840
that this vulnerability hakama memo and

243
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:55,230
finally with all the configuration we

244
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,199
will calculate the threshold and we will

245
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,330
be able to see if the tools have all

246
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,360
passed the test or whether they have

247
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:06,840
failed if they have failed then we would

248
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,100
stop production for example and these

249
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,959
vulnerabilities would have to be

250
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,000
corrected and then launch the analysis

251
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,490
once again so this is what we will be

252
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,540
doing these days thank you very much I

253
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:26,669
[Applause]

254
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:28,260
won't put up with questions in order to

255
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:31,559
make most of the room we'll do that at

256
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,230
the end so team two should be coming up

257
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,059
so please write down your questions so

258
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,419
that you can ask them to the right team

259
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,418
at the end

260
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:31,649
hey when I tell this good afternoon

261
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:34,799
we're you know s freak you part of inner

262
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:36,209
tech in Seville and we're going to

263
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,129
present red ops

264
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:45,779
it's a navigation to we auditors in

265
00:19:41,129 --> 00:19:48,089
cybersecurity office in Seville and we

266
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:51,499
do analysis of vulnerabilities and test

267
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:51,499
intrusions in our day-to-day work

268
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:02,728
we realize that enumeration processes

269
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,219
have a number of issues there are a

270
00:20:02,729 --> 00:20:08,399
number of tools and each tool gives the

271
00:20:05,219 --> 00:20:12,450
different result and each one gives you

272
00:20:08,399 --> 00:20:14,189
a different exit as it wishes and there

273
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,529
is a problem when you have many hosts

274
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:18,629
and different entities to pass

275
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:24,899
information from one entity to the next

276
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:26,908
and you given three patches you in order

277
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:29,998
to use that information to send it to

278
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:31,769
one tool or another so with many tools

279
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:33,960
it becomes very very complex you have a

280
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:37,229
lot of information that's difficult to

281
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,549
organize because you might be working in

282
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:40,440
the same assets over and over again

283
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:42,330
because at the same information so to

284
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,779
search for the information is very

285
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,449
difficult

286
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:50,070
rather than relaunching it this is a

287
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:53,820
waste of time so a red ops tool would be

288
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:56,570
a solution for that it's a platform that

289
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,570
allows the order to collect information

290
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:03,899
but also to organize the information so

291
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,639
in reports the auditor goes into red

292
00:21:03,899 --> 00:21:07,619
orbs and searches for the information

293
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:12,809
for the application has been launched

294
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:17,009
previously we would be using Python and

295
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:18,330
doctor to make it scalable so depending

296
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,879
on the number of the audits that you

297
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:22,460
have and to scare the containers who

298
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:29,089
know to have a larger or smaller

299
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:32,940
quantity of work so what is not red ops

300
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:35,310
they're only a number of assets based on

301
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,440
the auditor we're going to keep

302
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:41,580
or anything of those it just helps the

303
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:45,240
auditor the designers in three parts a

304
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,939
web the interface for the users in order

305
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,180
to some agents and some models the

306
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:54,630
audits interact with the web and they

307
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:57,300
send tasks to the agents and depend on

308
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,130
the agent or the and the tasks that they

309
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:05,550
have to do they execute one model or

310
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:09,150
another auditors can interact and the

311
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,710
audits are created and the auditor adds

312
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,580
the organization that needs to be

313
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:18,000
audited for example in eBay and the

314
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:21,870
assets such as Ethan dot s or any other

315
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,200
assets that he comes across so the jobs

316
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:27,449
are sent to the agents and this is a

317
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,360
numeration of the domains in this

318
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:34,200
particular case this information reaches

319
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:38,280
the agent and the agent executed by

320
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,820
searching for the domains as the results

321
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:46,290
come in this information is returned to

322
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:52,530
read and in real time the results can be

323
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:58,139
seen the current status is that we have

324
00:22:52,530 --> 00:23:01,560
the skeleton area of the web and the web

325
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:05,220
sockets that appropriate prepared for

326
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:06,600
the UI for the results during the

327
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,450
hackathon we're going to continue

328
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,850
developing the web and the agents and

329
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:15,600
all the models associated with the

330
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:23,399
process the modules that we would like

331
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:26,070
to implement is search for branches and

332
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,600
also search for domains in our

333
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:32,760
organization or search for scanning or

334
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,149
anything that can be done in these

335
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:43,230
different processes not only in an

336
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:44,700
active way but also in public sources to

337
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,220
see there are our credentials that have

338
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:51,000
been liquidated

339
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:56,100
as a bonus we would like to implement up

340
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:02,370
there is time in proxy Sox as part of

341
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:04,530
the tool if you use a a tool you can

342
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:08,549
have an internal part of the

343
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:11,000
organization so this would not only work

344
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:15,000
externally but also not it within the

345
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,460
organization and also in the future in

346
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,659
order to might be able to undergo a

347
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:26,870
audit process and also to enumerate and

348
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:30,150
other tasks such as exploiting an asset

349
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:33,469
instead of having an averse shell it

350
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:36,990
should give us an inverse shell red ox

351
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:39,210
and share that with different auditors

352
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,659
and there should be a kind of tunnel to

353
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:45,840
share the information for example a

354
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:48,240
packet that has been found previously in

355
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,490
the numeration and continue developing

356
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,650
that platform so that can exist right

357
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:57,720
across the audit we have the section of

358
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:00,480
the questions and answers but that would

359
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,470
be for afterwards and here we have some

360
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,780
links if you'd like some more

361
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,829
information about us

362
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,829
[Applause]

363
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,600
you

364
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,470
money

365
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:11,340
okay let's go ahead good afternoon thank

366
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:17,280
you very much in the first instance to

367
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:19,409
the jury for selecting our tool it's a

368
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:26,970
tool for called

369
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:34,919
all intelligence they were students of

370
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:36,720
mine Rafa and I'm two and above so I'm a

371
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:44,840
teacher and also got a consultant same

372
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:47,730
way three versus work talking about the

373
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,610
functions and the benefits of the tool

374
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:55,530
in this program and what we can add to

375
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:59,969
the community what we have seen is that

376
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:02,160
many clients that require a general

377
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:07,410
analysis without getting into a detailed

378
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:10,260
audit oh that's even some auditors to

379
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:15,080
know what the level of position is a

380
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:18,600
more general analysis so within the tool

381
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:21,178
there are two am bits a more technical

382
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:24,689
side information that we're going to

383
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,730
give to the tool domain and we can take

384
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,919
information from that tool and then

385
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,669
there's the digital entity which is also

386
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:35,340
very important the assets in this case

387
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,770
it's seeing the issues in terms of

388
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,409
digital identity and in terms of attacks

389
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,809
the issues that occurred take place if

390
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:45,630
there was a direct attack there is a

391
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:51,629
report for the end-user and now I will

392
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:55,200
explain how this Tool Works first of all

393
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:59,490
what we're going to give to the tool is

394
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:02,549
a domain and there's also in a technical

395
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,760
analysis from which we'll take some

396
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,760
information

397
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:12,320
and services that are active - you're

398
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:15,500
like realization and all those kinds of

399
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,899
servitors where we have that IP generic

400
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:21,590
information with different services from

401
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:26,029
third parties and some specific analysis

402
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:31,250
that can be manual such as email from

403
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:35,090
services and CMS and then we have the

404
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:37,820
other side which is sometimes left to

405
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:40,899
one side when ionisers go into the

406
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:44,870
digital side of imp taining information

407
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:48,320
from different to the people within the

408
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:50,000
company we often find that there are

409
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,330
many errors in this field many

410
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,210
vulnerabilities here we have different

411
00:29:53,330 --> 00:30:01,699
email addresses if there are leaks of

412
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:04,580
information associated mobile numbers

413
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:08,450
for people within the company

414
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:10,158
other possible email addresses and the

415
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,409
source from which this information has

416
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,519
been received when we know the source

417
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:24,279
sometimes the it's the information is

418
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:27,289
requested to be removed I find a domain

419
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:29,630
using an email address I can do the same

420
00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,220
analysis I can see if there's a link and

421
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:36,610
if there are other sources and see if

422
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:38,389
there's a profile that is very detailed

423
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,360
regarding the different people within

424
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:43,399
the organization we have the general

425
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,309
side on the technical side in terms of

426
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:48,500
the domain but we're going to

427
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:51,740
concentrate on the digital side where

428
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,080
there are different services as we're

429
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,360
saying we we use we use different

430
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,779
services we're going to use Python and

431
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:02,090
flask in terms of the interface and in

432
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:06,769
development we're going to use shodhan

433
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:11,809
max mind for localization and email

434
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:14,780
hunter for the email D hashed in terms

435
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:16,610
of the links it's a good

436
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:23,060
tool and it gives good results and

437
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:25,639
people we're going to interact in order

438
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,860
to do manual checks that we will perform

439
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:32,270
it depending on what we obtain we'll

440
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:34,639
have lots of units of information and we

441
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,020
need to obtain that in order to sort it

442
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,470
out and up to obtain the information

443
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:41,810
that we need in terms of security in

444
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:45,620
terms of domain we have the technical

445
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:48,530
side we just have the attack vectors on

446
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:51,649
the expose services and on the audit

447
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:54,139
side we have the digital side of the

448
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:56,060
people within the organisation to see

449
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,480
who they are what roles they have and

450
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:02,810
whatever failures there are what vectors

451
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:07,460
of entry there are directed towards them

452
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:10,550
that there may exist once we have those

453
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,920
units information the tool process the

454
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:17,000
information depending on the items that

455
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:22,060
we have and our aim is to generate

456
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,640
intelligence if we use a pen tester or a

457
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:27,200
security analysis we'd lose a lot more

458
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,060
time analyzing all the different

459
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,420
services and all the channels of

460
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:35,480
information rather than generating the

461
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:40,760
actual intelligence to generate the end

462
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:44,840
report so who's our audience companies

463
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:48,290
who could use this on the technical side

464
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:51,669
using the actual tool the companies from

465
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:55,340
inside an auditor offer services or

466
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:58,160
users in the hacking community a pen

467
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:02,570
testers intelligence or people who work

468
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:05,240
in this field similar projects we've all

469
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:08,860
used to spy taffert multi though it's

470
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,030
similar and all they have is

471
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,360
lots of information that we have to

472
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:15,610
select in this case we want the

473
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,959
information to be very precise and we

474
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:21,370
don't want to waste a lot of time

475
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,549
analyzing it we want to go direct to key

476
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:27,760
information to generate the report such

477
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:30,070
that in a general way we have a general

478
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,900
overview of the information that the

479
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,570
company wants to get so that we can go a

480
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,280
set for a closer to an internal audit

481
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:41,168
whether there is a certain internal or

482
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:43,960
external and much more in debt as I said

483
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:47,200
we're going to use Python because it's

484
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,289
easier to use and it's a global we're

485
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,580
going to develop it from scratch and we

486
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:57,460
can use a number of api's and we have

487
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,510
manual checking based on the different

488
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:04,330
vulnerabilities and in the age in the

489
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:08,290
end we will connect the information and

490
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:10,690
obtain a report that is general for both

491
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:14,159
sites that's the summary we have

492
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:17,230
different units of information from the

493
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,750
technical side and the digital identity

494
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:22,199
put it through the tool and in the end

495
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:25,359
we generate an intelligence report

496
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:28,210
that's what we aim to do over the coming

497
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,230
days thank you very much good luck

498
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:35,020
everybody

499
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:36,399
and Monica said the spirit here is to

500
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,139
share the information and sharing

501
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,980
information we multiply information

502
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:44,590
thank you very much to my colleagues

503
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:47,290
because they've helped us to achieve the

504
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,179
apps that we've that we're going to be

505
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,949
used in order to develop the tool thank

506
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:54,940
you very much

507
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:54,940
[Applause]

508
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:49,850
hola hello everyone we are 11 we come

509
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:55,820
from the University of castilla-la

510
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:59,180
mancha doing the PhD with the institute

511
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,980
for research computing research in our

512
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,990
Thursday with things this is very

513
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:16,810
important because of the only day we all

514
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:16,810
work inside the security and one malware

515
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:33,530
what we're going to see we're going by

516
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:36,680
introducing and motivate and see no I

517
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:40,690
this tune is being developed we also do

518
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,690
a state of fiancée you can see with

519
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:54,049
analyze submerges we're going to use and

520
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:59,090
our so why because we need to write

521
00:36:54,050 --> 00:37:03,440
papers the issue that we'll find and we

522
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:05,270
want to analyze if we want to do it in

523
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,420
the real environment we have a very

524
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,500
heterogeneous

525
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:14,750
environmental minimum we divide this

526
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:16,280
many networks where architecture makes

527
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:21,800
it really difficult to use the same

528
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:25,160
sample so we'll do is we're going to try

529
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:29,090
to put together a group of tools to

530
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:31,970
analyze this process what is audience

531
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:36,200
well basically ourselves you're going to

532
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:39,109
be benefited immediately this is good

533
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,220
for any analyst and anyone who is doing

534
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:45,690
the research

535
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:48,529
we're basically we are either the only

536
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,680
on one of the very few platforms that

537
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:54,599
open-source

538
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:57,990
multi focused in classification and

539
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:01,230
clustering both from dynamic and Static

540
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:04,890
feet now what alternatives do you find

541
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:07,020
to us there are songs are very good if

542
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,960
you see these tools they were very very

543
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:13,980
good but they don't have the features

544
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:17,970
you need for example lemon sandbox is

545
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:24,000
very useful similar to Allen what tool

546
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:26,580
bits only for x86 64 and I think it is

547
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,470
page as well detox is very familiar as

548
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:34,080
well it's more focused on traffic

549
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:36,299
analysis and we have launch we have to

550
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,920
do it manually for every instance and

551
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:48,060
then you have Falcon which is also pay

552
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:51,869
its features and functionalities we're

553
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:53,670
going to be able to choose one of the

554
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:55,730
things we've already done is

555
00:38:53,670 --> 00:39:02,250
complementing these machines we have

556
00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:06,720
PowerPC mix a RM work x86 to fool we

557
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:10,619
also characterize dynamically we're

558
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:15,480
going to focus on engrams right now but

559
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:17,490
we could actually for further if we have

560
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:22,520
time now that we're going to do a

561
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:27,299
clustering now what are our features

562
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:30,750
modularity we have a very submitted to

563
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:34,109
and it's also not very heavy so won't

564
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:35,790
have many computing requirements now

565
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:38,098
concerning security we've already

566
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:41,009
introduced its but what we're looking

567
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:46,080
for is characterizing and classifying

568
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:49,830
malware for different architectures when

569
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,690
it comes to technologies the pipeline

570
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,020
that we're going to use is segmented as

571
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,030
you contend with

572
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:57,820
and we're going to start with a sample

573
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,910
the trophy for any of the architectures

574
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:03,610
we're going to have a static analysis to

575
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:07,980
your strap the headings and no to which

576
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:07,980
virtual machine we have to launch it

577
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:13,270
obtain the dynamic characteristics or

578
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:18,670
going that features are we're going to

579
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:27,610
use and we are going to use to Raiders

580
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:31,330
Python futures and we know how we have

581
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:33,369
to execute it so depending on the tools

582
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:35,529
that we have machines that we have

583
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:37,690
completed we won't send it to the

584
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:40,330
corresponding machine will execute and

585
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:44,500
then we will get the results up to here

586
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:49,020
very easy to say not as easy to do and

587
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,020
then from there we will have some traces

588
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:56,340
like this in row we can get anything so

589
00:40:53,619 --> 00:41:02,619
we need a dynamic analysis so we

590
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:05,560
basically this consisting based on

591
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:09,070
engrams we think this is feasible

592
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:10,960
because it's not very complex from a

593
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,890
technical point of view and we think

594
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:18,490
they work really well

595
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:21,310
papers and state of art now once we have

596
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:25,660
the engrams was going to have a cluster

597
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:29,910
ization unofficial this visualization if

598
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:34,839
you have these immigrants how many like

599
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:38,920
to you where do many families and must

600
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,660
how can we visualize it I think it's

601
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,480
very interesting at least for us to have

602
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:47,080
a global vision of which samples are

603
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:50,619
alike this could be very representative

604
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:56,170
from point of view but what really

605
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:59,080
matters is how many similar samples to

606
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:01,480
every different thing do I have how they

607
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,500
are evolving in every different

608
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,500
architecture so

609
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,520
what have we done so far we haven't done

610
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:16,060
any coding but we're not starting from

611
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,190
zero or from scratch right now my

612
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,220
problem has been completing sometimes

613
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:23,470
with a bit of a headache

614
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:26,290
machines in little group to be lifted

615
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:27,879
after works we have chosen and I had a

616
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:30,970
first contact with most of the

617
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,650
technologies we're going to use and

618
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:34,870
wilden's and we've been doing some

619
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,750
concept tests although we don't have a

620
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:40,750
utility code and we have a design of the

621
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:43,570
pipeline which is from a as a conceptual

622
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:46,150
stage right now as we've shown you and

623
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:49,690
also something that is important is the

624
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:53,500
design of the work flow that we're going

625
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:55,300
to do as a team now what what do we

626
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,700
started still have to do well almost

627
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:01,450
everything we have to implement modules

628
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:04,960
for static analysis execution dynamic

629
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:06,700
analysis clustering of visualization we

630
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,930
have to integrate the modules and we

631
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,410
have to evaluate them with different

632
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:13,330
samples and finally if we have time than

633
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,029
the documentation which would be

634
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:17,140
absolutely great well this was for

635
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,170
questions but we're going to do this

636
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:25,439
later so this is it thank you

637
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:25,439
[Applause]

638
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:11,390
when I tell it we are broken pipe and we

639
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:15,830
going to do silicone machine learning

640
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:17,299
and we've done some testing because

641
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:27,529
otherwise it wouldn't be viable but we

642
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:30,080
didn't have a functional code yet one of

643
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:33,050
those sorry Carlos Maria is not here

644
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:39,348
right now then myself who I'm going to

645
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:43,010
be working on the so as I was saying

646
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:46,910
this is Web Application Firewall with

647
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:49,880
machine learning which is based on the

648
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:53,930
usual things but also in response

649
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:57,890
analyses in order to implement a SQL

650
00:44:53,930 --> 00:45:00,290
injection and to analyze the and detect

651
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:07,460
the errors and may arise it's also based

652
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:10,369
on analysis of HTTP this is not aimed

653
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:14,210
for blocking petitions but we will also

654
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:17,930
have an entropy yeah we have ID which

655
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:20,030
has average length of threes if

656
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:29,390
something else and it will make sense

657
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:31,220
and silly fool anyone web application or

658
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:33,098
any students who would like to see

659
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,810
applications of machine learning to

660
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:38,330
security it's not built for any specific

661
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:41,810
service because they were saying well in

662
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:44,598
an inverse process in regardless of the

663
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:47,990
server or the client you you can have a

664
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:51,080
configuration and then it works this is

665
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,729
how C let's proxy works receives the

666
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,420
petition it either

667
00:45:52,730 --> 00:46:02,150
it analyzes and it might block it if

668
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:08,960
it's malicious and sends them to the

669
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:10,140
server and otherwise to plank we want to

670
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,900
do indeed Django

671
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:16,049
as well analyze the configuration files

672
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,999
and do petitions autistics those which

673
00:46:16,049 --> 00:46:21,450
we have blocked as well we haven't

674
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:24,538
really thought about this yet because we

675
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:26,640
haven't done so much so far and we think

676
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:30,259
that as we advance and we progress we

677
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,259
will be able to figure this out to say

678
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:38,029
similar projects such as more security

679
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:49,710
because we know new series of parameters

680
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:53,190
apart from being the usual ones and we

681
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:59,960
have machine learning what is similarity

682
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:59,960
more security seal it works in real time

683
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:09,720
but we do need to change configuration

684
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:14,400
we do delete dangerous characters we do

685
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:17,578
the code URLs and we analyze the post as

686
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:23,099
well machine learning is going to be

687
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:25,710
done between Carlos have been able to

688
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,509
add many pictures because we sent it

689
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,640
before we actually started doing more

690
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:36,150
research so if they're going to torrents

691
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:39,029
and pictures thank you hello my name is

692
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,059
Alejandro via Rado and I'm going to be

693
00:47:39,029 --> 00:47:45,299
working with machine learning and

694
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:47,999
basically we've been doing research we

695
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:50,430
started looking into machine learning

696
00:47:47,999 --> 00:47:54,149
algorithms and we found that the one

697
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:58,140
which could suit our application most

698
00:47:54,150 --> 00:48:01,910
would be that of a cluster these

699
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:06,509
algorithms work grouping data in

700
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:08,970
subgroups and if one piece of data but

701
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:12,359
belongs to same subgroup then it means

702
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:16,618
that they are similar so basically the

703
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:20,290
data that will arrive to the proxy will

704
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,180
we will extract different features in

705
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:27,340
America data because we're going to

706
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:33,160
represent points in in a graph because

707
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:37,090
we are using numerical data then we will

708
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:40,000
have to extract strategic numerical data

709
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:41,860
from the information that comes to the

710
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,020
site because depending on these features

711
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:46,870
it will the algorithm will be more or

712
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,540
less efficient when it comes to

713
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:54,609
representing it in a graph so we've been

714
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:57,220
looking into is KNN and also Kamen's

715
00:48:54,610 --> 00:49:00,310
were still looking into algorithms that

716
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,830
we can use for development considering

717
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:05,520
the features we thought so far entropy

718
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:08,049
err the percentage of special and

719
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,360
alphanumerical characters but we're

720
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:12,820
still looking into those that I think

721
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:16,420
you all know how these algorithms work

722
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:19,180
here and what we're going to do is

723
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,250
initiate and pre-configured data set

724
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:27,339
that we will have changed was the public

725
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:31,330
tools and from that base of the reach

726
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:34,060
those tools we will get a way of

727
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:35,860
analyzing and representing those points

728
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:39,370
the nor going to be two or three

729
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:45,360
dimensional but rather we're going to

730
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:45,359
use a point with a lot of coordinates

731
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,170
and we're going to do is we're going to

732
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:56,380
classify that data in different clusters

733
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:58,870
and as we keep adding data than we will

734
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,730
keep adding points to that graph I think

735
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:04,450
more or less you know how machine

736
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:07,150
learning works but as we add points to

737
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:10,870
that graph then the library will

738
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:14,680
calculate the distance between them and

739
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:16,480
it will know whether specific piece of

740
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:20,109
data belongs to a cluster or to another

741
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,750
one so let's imagine that one cluster is

742
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:26,500
for malicious and the other one is for

743
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:28,540
non malicious users so we will be able

744
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,550
to analyze whether it's closer to one

745
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,700
cluster or the other and then therefore

746
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:35,880
in fair more than it

747
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:38,339
malicious or not and then once we

748
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,980
realize whether it is or not an attack

749
00:50:38,339 --> 00:50:43,980
then we will know we will be adding and

750
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:46,530
so the machine will be learning as we go

751
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:50,549
so we we want to use the library in

752
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:52,349
Python SK learn and now I'm going to

753
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:59,759
give the floor to Carlos who's going to

754
00:50:52,349 --> 00:51:03,140
explain the limitations well as we know

755
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,730
machine learning has its limitations and

756
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:08,160
typically for this domain what we're

757
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:11,670
going to do is we're going to try to

758
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:15,799
group with days that by families and

759
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:18,660
attacks amongst we cannot try to

760
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:21,869
identify a specific exploit because if

761
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:25,290
we're trying to upload a file to be

762
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:32,190
specific points we can see if it has

763
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:34,558
some sort of malicious feature but we're

764
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:38,339
not going to be able to detect the URL

765
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:40,920
we're going to look into the type of

766
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:45,000
family and of course machine learning

767
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:47,790
has its limitations we'll have to see

768
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,859
how this escalates because if our server

769
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:51,420
is getting thousands of petitions every

770
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:55,440
seconds and we will need to figure out

771
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:57,569
which algorithm is more useful when

772
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,750
asking the database and of course this

773
00:51:57,569 --> 00:52:03,029
poison is you can poison for the data

774
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:08,339
base are you using for machine learning

775
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:10,829
and obviously that would modify the

776
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:13,140
groups if it's that modifying groups and

777
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:15,150
maybe something that was malicious

778
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:17,009
before because it was well trained than

779
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:19,619
suddenly it shows us non-malicious

780
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:23,369
because it's been contaminated and hence

781
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:25,829
it has been moved to the remote and well

782
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:27,450
I think that's more or less it I don't

783
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:29,860
know everyone else in the team has

784
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:35,459
something to say thanks

785
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:35,459
[Applause]

786
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:08,849
hola yo good afternoon we're from

787
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:13,109
auntie team we'll come to present our

788
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:16,109
project we've called it SOT SOT thank

789
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:17,880
you for selecting this project and we'd

790
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:21,328
like to tell you a bit about the idea

791
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:24,689
that we've got what we'll do in the

792
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:26,219
hackathon it's the first time for me for

793
00:53:24,689 --> 00:53:28,920
the other members of obtainment it is

794
00:53:26,219 --> 00:53:31,680
not and they have won on other occasions

795
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,859
so obviously it's a challenge for us to

796
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,499
be here once again to participate once

797
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:43,078
again and try and do it very best and

798
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:46,529
enjoy the event our idea is to control

799
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:52,160
the world of IOT which has grown very

800
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:55,890
much over the last few years so domotics

801
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,749
both at home level and industry there

802
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:00,509
are millions and billions of devices

803
00:53:57,749 --> 00:54:03,390
that are connect to the internet and

804
00:54:00,509 --> 00:54:06,839
they are not controlled we have light

805
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:09,929
bulbs switches and anything is connected

806
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:11,969
to internet these days and these devices

807
00:54:09,929 --> 00:54:15,390
can be infected they have a number of

808
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:17,640
issues they have abnormal behavior on

809
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:19,589
occasions and this is the objective what

810
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:27,449
we would like to achieve here in this

811
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:30,509
project it's monitoring those devices so

812
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:33,630
to be preventing physical risk is risks

813
00:54:30,509 --> 00:54:36,890
because these devices are connected to

814
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:40,920
the electric power in our homes because

815
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:42,509
obviously a failure could cause an issue

816
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:47,249
and this would be the second part of our

817
00:54:42,509 --> 00:54:51,029
monitoring there could be issues in

818
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:53,399
terms of for example of a fire a light

819
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:56,249
bulb that's working incorrectly could

820
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:00,209
cause issues and that's related to fire

821
00:54:56,249 --> 00:55:02,459
and also the logic side of things we

822
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:03,310
need to control that many of the devices

823
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:07,330
that

824
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:10,450
we have in a network can be connected to

825
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:15,670
clouds and we have no control over them

826
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:18,970
all different types of networks and they

827
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:21,040
are connected to us in home and they

828
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:26,879
connect to the different servers and we

829
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:29,440
can't troll this in any way at all these

830
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,440
devices over the last few years I've

831
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:35,890
been part of the botnets that have

832
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:40,150
attacked a the DDoS is a number of webs

833
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:42,220
because these devices connected to a

834
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:44,020
very fast network the one that we have

835
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:46,299
at home and there are millions of them

836
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,730
and we have hundreds of these devices

837
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:50,290
and they are able to go through the

838
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:53,290
connection that we have in our homes

839
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:56,020
with no issues at all the objectives

840
00:55:53,290 --> 00:56:00,160
that we have in mind is to do a project

841
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:04,020
that is a very very simple the idea that

842
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:08,020
it should be easy for the user so that

843
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:11,740
anybody can use it on their desktop and

844
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:16,540
run any device and control what is going

845
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:21,390
on in his or her network so the logical

846
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:26,380
risks would be the internet side and and

847
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:28,420
also the physical threats so it's of

848
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:31,600
controlling the behavior of devices so

849
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:33,910
that they work appropriately and so that

850
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,279
users can detect any abnormal behavior

851
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:42,009
any issues or anything that is not

852
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:46,300
working as it should be working and so

853
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:49,600
30 spices can be within our systems can

854
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:54,280
and are controlled both inside and

855
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:57,040
outside the network so outside the

856
00:56:54,280 --> 00:57:00,360
network it would be our system will be

857
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:05,140
through some kind of connection which is

858
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:09,180
outside our system the target audience

859
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:12,009
would be for the final consumer mainly

860
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:14,819
people who don't have a lot of knowledge

861
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:17,400
because one of the main risks

862
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:20,820
is the fact that these divisive have

863
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:24,330
become common devices that we have in

864
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:27,420
our homes but the people who have them

865
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:30,720
are not people with a technical profile

866
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:33,570
and they have no concept of technical

867
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,240
security or control over the network in

868
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:38,210
their homes simply they have a light

869
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:42,689
bulb they connected in their homes and

870
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:45,060
then they have the domotics system is

871
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:48,600
working in the home where lexo or Google

872
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:53,509
whatever they have at home so this would

873
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:56,190
be on the security side of the projects

874
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:59,760
however the project that we want to do

875
00:57:56,190 --> 00:58:04,080
is not only in terms of the demotic said

876
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:07,020
that we have at home it's also in terms

877
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,730
of monitoring different types of

878
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:12,090
networks that we have in different

879
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:15,990
protocols and the activity going on in

880
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:18,690
these devices as I said the main aim is

881
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:22,680
to help people who have no prior

882
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:26,700
knowledge of the subject matter and who

883
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:30,390
can easily have in a notification for

884
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:34,230
example control over their devices and

885
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:38,640
actually to act on those devices at any

886
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:41,910
given time if there is something that is

887
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:44,910
going wrong and that this is unexpected

888
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:46,649
and is out of control so that they these

889
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:51,180
people can control any of these issues

890
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:54,780
that arise there are currently different

891
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:57,870
tools that are available we've been

892
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:59,790
having a look at these and there are

893
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:03,770
different projects that do different

894
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:08,100
things each of which do their own thing

895
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:12,410
there are controls of network activity

896
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:16,500
for example this is part of the project

897
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:18,450
and there are other things more related

898
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,010
to the different devices we have in our

899
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:22,589
homes but it's not a whole virile

900
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:25,910
general project we want to look at

901
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:27,910
behavior both in and out of the network

902
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:33,250
and we

903
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:36,640
also want this to extend outside the

904
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:38,410
network for example in a Wi-Fi or radio

905
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:41,230
frequency in order to be able to control

906
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:46,210
those devices in the different aspects

907
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:49,839
of the network within our homes as we

908
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:53,500
said the profile of the user is a person

909
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:56,980
who has no idea of this so it must be

910
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:59,650
easy to install and easy to control it

911
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:06,250
over time and without any prior

912
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:09,640
knowledge of of computer security we

913
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:14,170
want to use kiss methodology to make it

914
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:17,589
simple in terms of notifications so it

915
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:19,599
will be from sis tray we do not have

916
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:21,700
anything already we haven't brought

917
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:26,230
anything with us we've starting from

918
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:28,960
scratch we would like to build an app so

919
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:31,440
that can be used on mobile devices but

920
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:36,910
in any case we're going to be looking at

921
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:39,039
operability our idea is to start from

922
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:42,430
scratch in the hackathon over the two

923
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:47,109
days we're going to try and create a

924
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:51,279
system demotic system so that we have

925
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:54,490
actual devices working working in an

926
01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:57,970
erratic way so that we can see possible

927
01:00:54,490 --> 01:01:02,200
incorrect physical functions and also on

928
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:05,319
the logic side we'll use radio frequency

929
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,720
and Wi-Fi and all those devices will be

930
01:01:05,319 --> 01:01:10,808
connected in order to be able to control

931
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:14,200
activity and be able to notify that

932
01:01:10,809 --> 01:01:15,970
activity we'll be monitoring all that

933
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,250
activity so in order to be able to

934
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:20,319
receive their notifications through an

935
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:25,259
app that's so quite easy to use either

936
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:25,259
on a mobile or on our computers the

937
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:32,980
complexity of the project is mainly that

938
01:01:30,069 --> 01:01:35,589
there are many many networks

939
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:40,540
and that they are very heterogeneous and

940
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:44,290
controlling them is not easy so the

941
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:46,869
project aims to put them all into one

942
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:48,970
grouping all of those devices into one

943
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:51,940
group and control them in an efficient

944
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:53,649
manner so that's our project and thank

945
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:57,709
you very much good luck to everybody

946
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:57,709
[Applause]

947
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:38,489
when we sell and we are going to present

948
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:41,859
marshmallows the team is Alvaro who's

949
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:44,709
responsible for Communications Manuel

950
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:47,979
who's responsible for the Internet of

951
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:51,939
Things and I'm Guillermo and responsible

952
01:02:47,979 --> 01:02:54,729
for safety and authentication we

953
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:57,459
presented a project last year with a

954
01:02:54,729 --> 01:03:01,779
project called stuck and the aim of that

955
01:02:57,459 --> 01:03:02,288
project was to protect systems using a

956
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:07,869
port

957
01:03:02,289 --> 01:03:09,429
knocking system in actual fact when we

958
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:13,630
presented the project in real life it

959
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:17,229
wasn't successful we were told that what

960
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:20,559
they were looking for were laboratories

961
01:03:17,229 --> 01:03:22,629
and universities that we thought might

962
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:26,799
be interested in this they said the

963
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:30,099
following having an network of devices

964
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:32,739
is complicated if those devices are on

965
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:35,769
different networks they've got different

966
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:39,809
IDs and you need to have different

967
01:03:35,769 --> 01:03:45,459
passwords and authentication processes

968
01:03:39,809 --> 01:03:47,709
so what we propose is a solution when

969
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:52,299
you have several devices connected to a

970
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:56,410
network and the service would virtualize

971
01:03:52,299 --> 01:03:59,319
all of the that network and without

972
01:03:56,410 --> 01:04:00,819
knowing what the IP address is or and

973
01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:05,439
which cloud it is we'll be able to

974
01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:07,058
manage that in a normal manner and we

975
01:04:05,439 --> 01:04:10,899
would like to use that without the use

976
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:12,910
of obsolete passwords that will be just

977
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:17,079
hem free passwords and just one use

978
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:20,670
temporary passwords there are several

979
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:25,979
parts the first part is authentication

980
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:33,400
the user is connecting to the web and

981
01:04:25,979 --> 01:04:35,759
this would be done through an API either

982
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,800
the physical acts

983
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,900
and the password would save with retinal

984
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,150
it's her correct and give access to the

985
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:44,040
application

986
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:56,550
Alvaro will talk a little bit more about

987
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:59,100
this although it's called administration

988
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:04,020
actually we're talking about usability

989
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:07,009
of the application or the platform it is

990
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:12,660
installed as a private cloud from which

991
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:16,500
any user who enters into the system you

992
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:20,430
can manage the devices into the system

993
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:23,850
based on different roles and he or she

994
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:27,680
can gain access using the navigator so

995
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:27,680
this makes it's much simpler to use

996
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:37,110
there is a cost of agents and one of the

997
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:40,530
key points and basic points for our

998
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:45,990
solution is communications the most

999
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:49,140
relevant point is that they used has

1000
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:51,890
communication obviously from one extreme

1001
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:56,299
to another for their navigator to those

1002
01:05:51,890 --> 01:06:01,140
devices and we don't need to know IP

1003
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:07,860
addresses because the context is setting

1004
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:10,710
in a virtual manically there's no

1005
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:12,300
infrastructure for the network but we do

1006
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:16,080
see it in a virtual manner

1007
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:18,870
in the clouds we can have several clouds

1008
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:21,390
with different devices load it up onto

1009
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:24,890
those clouds and this is a way of

1010
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:29,220
virtualizing the elements the

1011
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:33,060
communications kennel channel is based

1012
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:38,120
on a protocol as an alternative through

1013
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:48,580
the TLS so that the devices

1014
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:48,580
that kinetic can be modified we will use

1015
01:06:52,150 --> 01:07:04,420
these are not RSA codes these are short

1016
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:08,060
codes of 32 bytes is interchange of

1017
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:11,900
Becky Cindy firm and secure container

1018
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:16,460
and the Hat words with TLS we wouldn't

1019
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:18,260
manage to do this perhaps these are the

1020
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:23,150
technologies that we're going to work

1021
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:26,780
with in the backend it can be go

1022
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:28,910
diamonds so that the entries and exit

1023
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,770
can create those channels in terms of

1024
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:34,270
for starting the session so that we can

1025
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:39,980
make those connections for the transport

1026
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:44,480
and we have databases and we don't have

1027
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:46,760
role and in charge of the front end we

1028
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,730
will develop that part of the wedding

1029
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:57,290
we've we've done that already we have

1030
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:59,330
the noise framework protocol this is a

1031
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:03,050
company that deals with wide world with

1032
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:06,049
firewalls that use nice noise technology

1033
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:12,380
but also what's up in its communications

1034
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:16,839
and its security protocol we also have

1035
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:19,430
their physical keys which is a you keys

1036
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:22,010
the ideal thing would be for us to

1037
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:26,839
implement it ourselves in terms of the

1038
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:31,609
temporary keys we'll use Trello and slag

1039
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:33,439
in terms of management and the platform

1040
01:08:31,609 --> 01:08:36,260
which is not dealing with the

1041
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:41,540
communications will be certain likewise

1042
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:46,730
RTW boys so this point onwards we'll

1043
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:48,710
start our work some of the components

1044
01:08:46,729 --> 01:08:50,238
are already ready and specifically the

1045
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:52,120
part of the web

1046
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:54,830
which was one of the things that

1047
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:56,870
conditioned our result last year and

1048
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:59,180
we'd like to make it a little bit more

1049
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:59,479
attractive this time so that's it for

1050
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:06,789
now

1051
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:06,789
[Applause]

1052
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:41,179
all out

1053
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:50,310
good evening the idea we're going to

1054
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:52,680
tell you about is called Wi-Fi would you

1055
01:09:50,310 --> 01:09:54,360
think it's very technical we do believe

1056
01:09:52,680 --> 01:10:00,330
there's little problems that effects

1057
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:02,580
many people and it's how to securitize

1058
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:06,240
Wi-Fi what is the best option for you

1059
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:09,930
Wi-Fi to be secure I think I've gone

1060
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:13,139
over my slide story and who are we I'm

1061
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:17,280
bigger than work was respond to Fernanda

1062
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:20,840
and Sandy I am dealing with security but

1063
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:24,750
we have ghost content security

1064
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:29,250
developers so we're very complete team

1065
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:31,530
and we hope this will work so it happens

1066
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:34,650
to me very often because people keep

1067
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:36,929
asking or saying all my neighbors

1068
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:39,330
healing my Wi-Fi on my parenting or did

1069
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:41,550
you change my password is my Wi-Fi work

1070
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:43,860
better and it seems that we're advancing

1071
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:46,890
a lot in security that we apply many

1072
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:49,830
what if any measures and we find best

1073
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:52,680
practices that be done or implemented at

1074
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:54,450
home everywhere in the world maybe it

1075
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:56,520
will be better to not give that many

1076
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:58,470
options and just say well the most

1077
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:02,130
secure configuration of this one with

1078
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:07,320
features and implemented in at home

1079
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:10,650
everywhere because then you have cars

1080
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:13,920
caning public or private wi-fi's and

1081
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:16,469
they are vulnerable and you can launch

1082
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,340
massive attacks so I think the best

1083
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:21,829
thing for these Wi-Fi switch would be to

1084
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:25,940
be securitized

1085
01:11:21,829 --> 01:11:31,308
possible who is this intended to well no

1086
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:33,469
one who's very techie basically so my

1087
01:11:31,309 --> 01:11:36,349
parents didn't have to say configured my

1088
01:11:33,469 --> 01:11:38,630
Wi-Fi please let me go basically but

1089
01:11:36,349 --> 01:11:40,250
anyone can do it at home so there the

1090
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:42,949
application says okay give me the

1091
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:45,230
credentials we will check whether they

1092
01:11:42,949 --> 01:11:46,879
are or not secure and we will go step by

1093
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:49,968
step so this is definitely something

1094
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:53,659
that's no internal to someone who's take

1095
01:11:49,969 --> 01:11:56,719
you're knowledgeable but it does improve

1096
01:11:53,659 --> 01:12:02,019
security in our everyday life are there

1097
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:05,300
any other tools like these when looking

1098
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:07,869
like these we find a lot Wi-Fi pin

1099
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:09,980
testing or Wi-Fi check and tracking

1100
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:12,098
applications but not so much for

1101
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:16,388
auditing and checklist

1102
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:18,770
secure applications but basically

1103
01:12:16,389 --> 01:12:22,280
aircrack trying to the author and

1104
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:24,290
someone receives packages and the

1105
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:28,429
password so we see there's something

1106
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:32,150
missing there more visa launched one

1107
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:33,500
recently but it's if you have noticed

1108
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:35,388
that you have to download and then you

1109
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,949
have to configure it yourself but if I

1110
01:12:35,389 --> 01:12:38,510
say that to my dad if he would say well

1111
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:40,699
I still don't know why I have to do all

1112
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:43,369
why I have to insert or what kind of

1113
01:12:40,699 --> 01:12:47,540
password I have to have or does it have

1114
01:12:43,369 --> 01:12:49,579
to be a Bennett ated how many characters

1115
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:52,040
doesn't have to have so I think if you

1116
01:12:49,579 --> 01:12:56,179
do that for them and it's easier and

1117
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:59,059
when these problems sometimes you see

1118
01:12:56,179 --> 01:13:01,880
that you have to hide IDs and some

1119
01:12:59,059 --> 01:13:04,250
others you don't we're going to use them

1120
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:05,960
Phoebe's guide which is the easiest and

1121
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:08,329
as we have it and it's very

1122
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:10,400
well-structured we think we'll use that

1123
01:13:08,329 --> 01:13:12,590
one and nowadays there are there's

1124
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:15,290
hardly any home that doesn't have a

1125
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:19,099
Wi-Fi access so this is going to have an

1126
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:22,150
impact on everyone at homes everywhere

1127
01:13:19,099 --> 01:13:27,559
in the world how do you know that

1128
01:13:22,150 --> 01:13:29,629
everyone your building block has it well

1129
01:13:27,559 --> 01:13:33,350
configured and that they are following

1130
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:41,160
the rules for security come on

1131
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:44,220
well as Miguel was saying everyone knows

1132
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:45,900
how to you know carry my fire but I'm

1133
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:48,510
not going to ask you to raise your house

1134
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:51,049
because very interesting but how many of

1135
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:53,070
you have you actually started

1136
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:54,560
configuring it even if you have the

1137
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:59,040
knowledge

1138
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:06,810
well we want to develop that idea and

1139
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:16,290
see and different companies that we've

1140
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:20,580
had - we really could do looking into in

1141
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:22,890
Eva's guide on one fine security at this

1142
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:26,000
is the most general thing what someone

1143
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:28,350
what always everyone can do people

1144
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,810
either don't know how to connect to

1145
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:40,290
Wi-Fi or don't know how to do it so we

1146
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:50,100
have the password to be SSI management

1147
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:51,900
password than DWP okay and that's mostly

1148
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:55,710
updated by technicians when they come

1149
01:14:51,900 --> 01:15:03,809
home but we didn't really use type of

1150
01:14:55,710 --> 01:15:09,210
cipher then we can also filter by and

1151
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:12,480
also reduce potentials - we all have the

1152
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:14,970
maximum potential and power so that we

1153
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,950
can use our Wi-Fi from the park but that

1154
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:19,650
also means the package can access our

1155
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:20,940
Wi-Fi from very far away so we've got

1156
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:24,660
many ideas but this is the most

1157
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:25,860
realistic approach so now my colleague

1158
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:30,380
is going to tell you how we're going to

1159
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:33,839
do it in quantum okay long 3sat well

1160
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:36,840
what we're going to use because we want

1161
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:39,900
to be realistic and count time

1162
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:42,760
constraints we have to a few Reuters so

1163
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:46,269
we have already

1164
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:48,670
prepared so that so as to avoid the

1165
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:53,500
different interfaces and see how every

1166
01:15:48,670 --> 01:16:00,070
interface works the project at the end

1167
01:15:53,500 --> 01:16:03,790
of the day will be applications computer

1168
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:07,889
desktops we're going to do it in a way

1169
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:11,050
that I want to do it in fast

1170
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:13,420
we're going to do the back on Python

1171
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:15,640
although ideally we would allow for all

1172
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:20,920
this logic to actually be embedded in

1173
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:21,550
the application thank you so much and

1174
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:28,760
good luck

1175
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:28,760
[Applause]

1176
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:11,470
buddy 100 dollars hello everyone we

1177
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:14,429
going to little precentral we have

1178
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:14,430
prepared for this happy

1179
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:21,910
[Music]

1180
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:28,990
well sorry first of all I'm going to the

1181
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:35,410
team we started working at we saw that

1182
01:17:28,990 --> 01:17:41,910
when I started managing all the assets

1183
01:17:35,410 --> 01:17:45,280
in old age running was always the same

1184
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:48,250
old age will notify the person in charge

1185
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:51,540
of the application and a hundred inform

1186
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:55,150
the developers of one see developers

1187
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:57,330
identify the vulnerability the head of

1188
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,330
the

1189
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:46,390
of emails that were lost in time very

1190
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:48,160
often it was directly and when it was

1191
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:54,430
solved that we could see directly that

1192
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:57,150
it was done I think now Mariano can take

1193
01:18:54,430 --> 01:19:04,540
the floor to talk about architecture

1194
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:07,719
what ass hello my name is Mariana I

1195
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:07,720
[Music]

1196
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:57,180
[Music]

1197
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:22,960
we complete a microservice MJS with

1198
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:27,590
expressed je s and my crew screen they

1199
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:31,850
express je s in the application also

1200
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:43,880
type DRM our database we can now use

1201
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:46,760
Network any kind and web services so

1202
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:51,080
will the database which will work as in

1203
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:55,600
our years and the application will be on

1204
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:55,600
nginx and then we will go into a fire to

1205
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:06,080
project this will allow people to

1206
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:08,120
develop it and escalate it and they will

1207
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,680
be able to add pieces without having to

1208
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:12,170
get rid of the ones that were there

1209
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:18,460
before and now I'll give the floor to

1210
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:23,230
officials why

1211
01:21:18,460 --> 01:21:28,420
this project Allah was saying we

1212
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:32,320
identified lacks really because our

1213
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:35,260
development team well you know working

1214
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:39,610
with agile methodologies and the

1215
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:47,470
security team we saw the ones we had a

1216
01:21:39,610 --> 01:21:52,480
class imagine we would have voter

1217
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:56,380
ability we go in update state but the

1218
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:59,019
teams were not ready to work within a to

1219
01:21:56,380 --> 01:22:01,930
Thor was outside its lifecycle they

1220
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:06,280
didn't want to work on that because we

1221
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:08,130
will not have this tool and the

1222
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:11,740
integration we're going to do with era

1223
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:13,570
we solve all these problems and hours

1224
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:15,880
you've been seeing companies are going

1225
01:22:13,570 --> 01:22:18,849
to invest assessment more on

1226
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:23,830
cybersecurity and we're seeing two

1227
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:31,000
things one big corporations with lots of

1228
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:34,540
resources that could buy who are going

1229
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,700
to use only three defense tools so you

1230
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:46,420
might be paying for a cloud processing

1231
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:48,340
and licensing it's one day you have you

1232
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,900
didn't have auditors but now all of a

1233
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:52,060
sudden everyone is panicking and then we

1234
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:53,860
have 20 auditors so with the methodology

1235
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:57,460
that we're going to implement if you

1236
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:59,080
have a team made of experts in many

1237
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:01,960
different domains they will have

1238
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:03,850
different things that they can do you

1239
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:08,110
will have the whole cycle from when the

1240
01:23:03,850 --> 01:23:10,630
audit is being launched then you open

1241
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:13,089
the vulnerability to the team in its

1242
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:15,820
workflow and in the form of the working

1243
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:18,880
on right now so you have visibility on

1244
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:26,889
when it's been solved to check but it's

1245
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:29,560
actually so also concerning the team of

1246
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:30,900
auditors which is growing constantly

1247
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:35,510
growing we

1248
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:40,949
add and knowledge part so when you

1249
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:43,460
identify a vulnerability you will be

1250
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:45,750
able to add to those reports

1251
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:47,400
automatically how to solve that

1252
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:51,570
vulnerability and that's what we will

1253
01:23:47,400 --> 01:24:00,750
help the development team on security

1254
01:23:51,570 --> 01:24:03,049
and we also report generation because

1255
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:05,100
another one of the things that we see in

1256
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:07,560
companies is that when you invest in

1257
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:10,350
cybersecurity you want to see that the

1258
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:13,050
company's actually safe so it's useless

1259
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:15,810
you have a cyber security team of to

1260
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:17,969
have a sock I'm not senior results so

1261
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:21,540
with this what we want to do is to

1262
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:23,670
create a dashboard where we can see all

1263
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:25,679
the assets that we have the

1264
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:28,860
vulnerabilities that we've found the

1265
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:31,800
status of each vulnerability and so you

1266
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:33,929
see what stayed on what stage the

1267
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,440
project is in how does this compare to

1268
01:24:33,929 --> 01:24:40,800
other similar projects well we've taken

1269
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:44,428
some commercial products and as well as

1270
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:48,000
open source products and as you can see

1271
01:24:44,429 --> 01:24:52,469
we have tenable our kinetics when it

1272
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:55,590
comes to commercial product we actually

1273
01:24:52,469 --> 01:24:59,010
have our kinetics and you do lawnchair

1274
01:24:55,590 --> 01:25:01,170
it's oriented to web applications is

1275
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:04,050
going to take at least 150

1276
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:06,060
vulnerabilities we know level

1277
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:08,400
vulnerabilities every day then no one is

1278
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:12,540
really going to deal with it's very good

1279
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:14,699
with licensing costs very high so while

1280
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:23,640
we trying to solve with this open source

1281
01:25:14,699 --> 01:25:25,259
to something with that allows you to

1282
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:26,250
keep working and that it's not too

1283
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,810
expensive because there will be

1284
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:29,520
companies that have a lot of resources

1285
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:31,560
but some others worry and if you go to

1286
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:35,219
your directors and you say I need three

1287
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:37,679
thirty thousand euros a year for our

1288
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:39,900
kinetics to analyze vulnerabilities they

1289
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:42,090
will say well no and that's it and

1290
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:45,420
that's the end of it and when it comes

1291
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:55,860
to open source we have our jury artery

1292
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:59,520
and jackhammer actually has an API but

1293
01:25:55,860 --> 01:26:01,259
it doesn't have permission manager and

1294
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,449
depending on the infrastructure some

1295
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:06,650
vulnerabilities are even considered

1296
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:11,360
confidential because until they are

1297
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:19,860
solved they can put the company at risk

1298
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:23,909
and this is the team it's all of us here

1299
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:26,699
here today and just very quickly what

1300
01:26:23,909 --> 01:26:27,269
we're going to be doing during this

1301
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:30,449
hackathon

1302
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:33,540
right now in atlases my own always

1303
01:26:30,449 --> 01:26:36,629
saying we only have structure in angular

1304
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:39,989
we can create an organization or company

1305
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:41,790
and audit owner ability it's not very

1306
01:26:39,989 --> 01:26:44,280
well related so we're going to generate

1307
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:46,610
this integration with JIRA so we can

1308
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:50,309
actually get into the life cycle of

1309
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:53,790
development teams and in owner dashboard

1310
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:56,820
so as to have that executive report that

1311
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:59,130
gives us an insight of the status very

1312
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:01,139
quickly and we will have the different

1313
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:03,780
methodologies for every team and then a

1314
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:05,550
knowledge base so the viscous with the

1315
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:09,898
faster thank you very much

1316
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:09,899
[Applause]

1317
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:56,900
hello what about pick.we or Uhl tech and

1318
01:27:53,510 --> 01:28:00,320
we're going to develop IHS and just

1319
01:27:56,900 --> 01:28:01,789
drill hacking simulator I don't want to

1320
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:06,619
go to too much today too but let me

1321
01:28:01,789 --> 01:28:11,389
introduce my colleagues Alvaro Shula who

1322
01:28:06,619 --> 01:28:13,610
will deal with pentesting in fact he has

1323
01:28:11,389 --> 01:28:19,010
worked in a company in Lithuania in this

1324
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:21,499
first and Nicholas Lok who is the expert

1325
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:24,320
in industrial matters in terms of

1326
01:28:21,499 --> 01:28:27,978
hacking he's a colleague of mine from

1327
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:30,530
the University of alcalá and then this

1328
01:28:27,979 --> 01:28:39,019
me Carlos I work in the University of

1329
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:40,639
alcalá University that's Nikolas and me

1330
01:28:39,019 --> 01:28:46,489
and then we added in our other

1331
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:50,689
colleagues we based around security in

1332
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:52,820
industrial environments we've been

1333
01:28:50,689 --> 01:28:55,999
talking about this over the last few

1334
01:28:52,820 --> 01:29:00,469
years and in fact it's one of the talks

1335
01:28:55,999 --> 01:29:05,050
that have been mentioned in cyber cam we

1336
01:29:00,469 --> 01:29:08,570
were given and great presentation about

1337
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:10,699
industrial security but in the end they

1338
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:15,709
don't have being hundred percent

1339
01:29:10,699 --> 01:29:17,808
isolated and not fully safe they should

1340
01:29:15,709 --> 01:29:21,019
be but they need to undergo a pen

1341
01:29:17,809 --> 01:29:25,219
testing process in fact they have been

1342
01:29:21,019 --> 01:29:30,189
actual real tax of ransomware against

1343
01:29:25,219 --> 01:29:32,539
industrial entities this is a fact and

1344
01:29:30,189 --> 01:29:36,559
security needs to be part of these

1345
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:40,099
organisms so I idea is to develop test

1346
01:29:36,559 --> 01:29:42,619
beds on which you can work in an

1347
01:29:40,099 --> 01:29:43,460
industrial environment with actually

1348
01:29:42,619 --> 01:29:48,230
being

1349
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:51,800
industrial environment you can do tests

1350
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:55,309
or pen testing like alpha wants to do so

1351
01:29:51,800 --> 01:30:00,770
we wish to virtualize a pen test where

1352
01:29:55,310 --> 01:30:03,110
we can do practice and we can go in

1353
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:07,040
there what I actually burn anything how

1354
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:10,549
are we going to do this there is already

1355
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:13,250
a project which is mini CPS which is the

1356
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:17,840
basis of the project it's a project that

1357
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:23,030
we like very much and it has been used

1358
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:25,550
by scientists in order to do C TFS and

1359
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:32,469
so on it's based on mini

1360
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:35,560
net the issue with mini cps that i found

1361
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:41,450
as we were working is that it's in

1362
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:45,050
Python it's just about one month left

1363
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:47,420
before it's no longer existent so it

1364
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:51,710
need to be exported and we've been

1365
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:56,660
looking into this issue and we would

1366
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:59,120
like to export mini cps and incorporate

1367
01:30:56,660 --> 01:31:02,150
a program that could be used in

1368
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:05,780
industrial environments and recuperate

1369
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:09,860
this project which was used in our PhD

1370
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:10,610
in 2017 so I would like to bring it back

1371
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:18,440
to life

1372
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:19,849
and put it into Python 3 there's no

1373
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:26,900
sense for it to be elsewhere now that

1374
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:33,020
when 2020 we have a water treatment

1375
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:36,820
testbed basis and it allows us to

1376
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:41,180
emulate and industrial environments and

1377
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:43,610
different situations in the environment

1378
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:45,250
and this is the basis of the project and

1379
01:31:43,610 --> 01:31:48,679
we would like to create our own

1380
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:50,510
environments for water treatment or

1381
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:53,270
anything else that we can't worth or

1382
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:56,290
different sectors that we have time to

1383
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:56,290
deal with in the hackathon

1384
01:31:56,630 --> 01:32:01,040
we'll need for everything to work every

1385
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:03,500
correctly because we need to emulate

1386
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:07,130
traffic and so on

1387
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:10,520
currently it is working in Python seven

1388
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:12,320
and we'd like to emulate other different

1389
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:17,480
kinds of scenarios in a water treatment

1390
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:21,170
plant gamma fication is very interesting

1391
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:24,160
in this field in order to do that we

1392
01:32:21,170 --> 01:32:27,350
need to use CTF

1393
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:28,700
will be next to people using CTF sin the

1394
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:29,990
hackathon so I don't know if they'll

1395
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:34,400
have industrial environments but it

1396
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:40,820
could be used it hasn't got many CPS's

1397
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:46,670
and it's our own development can be

1398
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:50,870
gamified even more to deal with attacks

1399
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:52,730
to the industrial network this is a

1400
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:56,620
project and these the idea that we'd

1401
01:32:52,730 --> 01:33:00,740
like to develop over the coming days and

1402
01:32:56,620 --> 01:33:04,340
here is some of the parts that we're

1403
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:07,429
going to use and we have to set up the

1404
01:33:04,340 --> 01:33:10,460
industrial environment and it needs to

1405
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:13,880
be documented and sure that we have been

1406
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:15,770
able to achieve this so it's not just

1407
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:19,430
creating the environment but documenting

1408
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:23,270
it and showing and maybe use it as a pen

1409
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:24,680
tester because so to show that being

1410
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:27,170
worked directly an environment of this

1411
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:33,700
kind in terms of visualization would be

1412
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:33,700
something like this it's with the C++

1413
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:40,690
and in the water treatment plants that

1414
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:42,980
we talked about before we could use

1415
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:45,259
another system to make it a little bit

1416
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:47,419
easier this would be a bit of the

1417
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:50,630
animation so that you can see if

1418
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:54,110
something goes wrong so they can make a

1419
01:33:50,630 --> 01:33:57,340
little bit more visual for the user even

1420
01:33:54,110 --> 01:34:01,509
that the attack is going on in any case

1421
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:01,510
so how are we going to achieve this

1422
01:34:01,849 --> 01:34:08,840
it's in many sinesses in Python we moved

1423
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:11,419
on to Python 3 we'd like to be able to

1424
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:16,219
use everything but was hey what time we

1425
01:34:11,419 --> 01:34:17,780
have to you to do that we might have to

1426
01:34:16,219 --> 01:34:24,099
put everything in Dockers and see how it

1427
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:26,989
goes we also use a flask in terms of

1428
01:34:24,099 --> 01:34:34,309
documenting documentation I mentioned

1429
01:34:26,989 --> 01:34:37,518
jib hub and we're going to use safe

1430
01:34:34,309 --> 01:34:41,169
development systems this is a hackathon

1431
01:34:37,519 --> 01:34:48,499
but it's a good to include automatic

1432
01:34:41,169 --> 01:34:53,358
tools and we may use a snake or bot that

1433
01:34:48,499 --> 01:34:56,869
has a relationship with github we'll use

1434
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:59,989
maybe some of the more known ones and so

1435
01:34:56,869 --> 01:35:03,589
analysis of the code we also have a

1436
01:34:59,989 --> 01:35:09,289
github and this would be a bit of a

1437
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:11,059
bonus I don't need you to point me to

1438
01:35:09,289 --> 01:35:14,539
you or anything so as long as it gets

1439
01:35:11,059 --> 01:35:18,169
into give her anything there's another

1440
01:35:14,539 --> 01:35:20,209
issue the quality of the coding so we'll

1441
01:35:18,169 --> 01:35:26,090
have to have a look into this so we'll

1442
01:35:20,209 --> 01:35:27,438
solve the issues that all does this has

1443
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:32,689
to be done we don't need to just talk

1444
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:35,959
about it but actually do it this is all

1445
01:35:32,689 --> 01:35:39,590
we have this is the linker currently is

1446
01:35:35,959 --> 01:35:41,300
nothing but you will see that we will

1447
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:44,499
add things as the hackathon moves

1448
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,499
forward thank you

1449
01:36:35,070 --> 01:36:46,080
good afternoon we are a team that is

1450
01:36:41,490 --> 01:36:51,269
Nydia Jose okay and myself Ruth and a

1451
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:55,860
proposal for the series sir and he sort

1452
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:58,290
of surfing attack platform so shoulder

1453
01:36:55,860 --> 01:37:00,059
surfing is the issue that we would like

1454
01:36:58,290 --> 01:37:03,750
to resolve with the tool that we're

1455
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:07,380
proposing this is the first issue of

1456
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:12,600
Assad that we presented previously in

1457
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:15,510
cyber camp and we'll see the development

1458
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:16,590
since Malaga up until now and the tool

1459
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:20,540
that we want to develop in the

1460
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:22,620
hackathons so what is shoulder surfing

1461
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:25,560
it's the issue that would like to

1462
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:28,290
resolve its an social engineering

1463
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:31,980
technique that allows the attacker to

1464
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:35,040
steal information from the victim and do

1465
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:38,089
so over the person's shoulder that could

1466
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:41,820
be in a public place or on a train or

1467
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:44,430
using any device that you have and the

1468
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:46,340
person is behind you and able to see

1469
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:49,290
what you're doing and if you using

1470
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:51,090
sensitive data searches passwords or

1471
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:54,150
bank details they can use that

1472
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:57,480
information against you there are

1473
01:37:54,150 --> 01:38:00,450
different alternatives and the main four

1474
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:03,480
that we came up with with these but none

1475
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:08,010
of them convinced us so we decided to

1476
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:11,040
develop a sack the alternatives are HP

1477
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:18,720
show view protectors Hardware Google a

1478
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:20,370
screen and filters software these films

1479
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:22,800
that you have to go on top of the

1480
01:38:20,370 --> 01:38:24,570
computer and these are not interesting

1481
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,150
for the user because they're images that

1482
01:38:24,570 --> 01:38:29,639
on the in the background for example in

1483
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:34,469
your mobile and this is a not easy to

1484
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:36,329
use the only software option is variable

1485
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:39,690
is the software filters it

1486
01:38:36,329 --> 01:38:46,980
just test of the concept developed by

1487
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:49,769
google and it's not available and HP

1488
01:38:46,980 --> 01:38:55,199
Shoreview is developed is available in

1489
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:58,889
some devices so the tool that we have

1490
01:38:55,199 --> 01:39:03,449
developed is called a SAP and the

1491
01:38:58,889 --> 01:39:08,730
shoulder surfing is what it aims to to

1492
01:39:03,449 --> 01:39:10,860
get rid of it's developed for facial

1493
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:13,440
recognition so that if a person or

1494
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:17,190
several people in front of her device it

1495
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:20,669
works in different kind of way and this

1496
01:39:17,190 --> 01:39:21,839
is what we presented in 2018 what are

1497
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:23,579
the characteristics has got a

1498
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,860
multi-platform it can be used for

1499
01:39:23,579 --> 01:39:31,009
Windows Mac and Linux

1500
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:34,980
it has facial recognition specifically

1501
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:37,079
SSD mobile network and one and when

1502
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:42,239
there are several faces there are

1503
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:44,099
different executions it reduces the

1504
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:47,400
shine on the computer it blocks the

1505
01:39:44,099 --> 01:39:52,829
computer for example the technology is

1506
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:54,598
electron UJS and face appeal Jas we're

1507
01:39:52,829 --> 01:39:58,170
going to use these technologies once

1508
01:39:54,599 --> 01:40:02,790
again and our challenge is to use

1509
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:07,110
algorithms for face matching both web

1510
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:10,760
technologies this is a demonstration of

1511
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:10,759
what we presented last year

1512
01:40:39,829 --> 01:40:51,509
this is the screen of the two there's a

1513
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:53,579
blue covering the face of the person

1514
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:56,190
that's using the device in other words

1515
01:40:53,579 --> 01:41:00,900
it's detecting that person let's go to

1516
01:40:56,190 --> 01:41:03,598
the operation if for somebody goes in

1517
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:05,369
front of their device then that face is

1518
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:12,449
detected and there's an alert that comes

1519
01:41:05,369 --> 01:41:14,728
up directly this is another example and

1520
01:41:12,449 --> 01:41:17,789
as a result of detecting the face

1521
01:41:14,729 --> 01:41:24,749
lambish the shine on the screen has

1522
01:41:17,789 --> 01:41:27,570
disappeared so a sap that we started

1523
01:41:24,749 --> 01:41:29,760
last year in cyber camp and that we've

1524
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:31,799
been developing this year we've improved

1525
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:37,219
the application we've improved the

1526
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:39,869
interface and it now no longer needs a

1527
01:41:37,219 --> 01:41:41,550
internet connection order to work

1528
01:41:39,869 --> 01:41:43,228
correctly this is one of the suggestions

1529
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:45,780
that we were given last year in order to

1530
01:41:43,229 --> 01:41:47,760
improve the application and we didn't

1531
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:52,170
have time to do that in the hackathon in

1532
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:55,679
March they see it was presented in the

1533
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:58,559
Reuters conference in Madrid and as a

1534
01:41:55,679 --> 01:42:03,239
result it was there was a great deal of

1535
01:41:58,559 --> 01:42:07,229
interest and in April 2019 there were

1536
01:42:03,239 --> 01:42:10,678
two new issues that we intend to resolve

1537
01:42:07,229 --> 01:42:13,010
during the hackathon there are certain

1538
01:42:10,679 --> 01:42:16,829
limitations currently to the

1539
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:19,320
applications because it only detects if

1540
01:42:16,829 --> 01:42:22,308
there are more than one face but does

1541
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:27,630
not know if face is authorized or not

1542
01:42:22,309 --> 01:42:30,090
the screen has to be visible all the

1543
01:42:27,630 --> 01:42:33,269
time and this means that those may not

1544
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:36,929
be easy to use in the day-to-day it's

1545
01:42:33,269 --> 01:42:40,349
also expensive and the alert methods are

1546
01:42:36,929 --> 01:42:41,780
currently quite limited as we saw in the

1547
01:42:40,349 --> 01:42:45,740
demo

1548
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:48,860
King this into account the options that

1549
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:51,469
we have for this year is to include a

1550
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:54,830
number of things including face

1551
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:57,230
recognition knowing who's which person

1552
01:42:54,830 --> 01:43:02,180
have authorization to use the screening

1553
01:42:57,230 --> 01:43:04,370
use the device perhaps we need to change

1554
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:07,040
the configuration panel as a result of

1555
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:09,740
this because we have the option of

1556
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:16,760
adding editing or limiting the number of

1557
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:19,190
people and we would surely need a dent

1558
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:22,340
occasion for this we would also like to

1559
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:25,820
add new alert methods such as through

1560
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:28,280
email push notifications integration

1561
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:32,630
with telegram or slack for example and

1562
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:37,880
also we'd like to improve use of the app

1563
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:45,050
and to give some easy ways to use the

1564
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:48,100
functions and making sure that the

1565
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:51,140
screen is achieve it useful for the user

1566
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:55,400
we'd like to improve the documentation

1567
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:57,260
so that it's easier to use and make a

1568
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:59,480
better contribution to the project and

1569
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:02,870
we'd like to check to see if it's

1570
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:05,959
possible to expose the app through an

1571
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:09,519
API to give services to third parties

1572
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:15,010
such as through the operating system

1573
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:15,010
this is the repository for the project

1574
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:21,679
and we intend to promote the project and

1575
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:23,840
improve the project during the hackathon

1576
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:26,320
so that's everything from us thank you

1577
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,320
very much

1578
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:21,820
what started as a loss good evening

1579
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:24,699
everyone my name is Quan the second year

1580
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:26,980
in a row guarded box it's an application

1581
01:45:24,699 --> 01:45:30,308
that I already presented for the hack of

1582
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:33,459
last year and one thing I would like to

1583
01:45:30,309 --> 01:45:35,829
say is that I do take part in many cyber

1584
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:38,650
security challenges but the one I like

1585
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:40,840
the most is this one no doubt so I would

1586
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:44,159
like to use a few seconds to thank the

1587
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:46,389
organization in FIBA the jury and

1588
01:45:44,159 --> 01:45:48,780
everyone and thank you for giving us

1589
01:45:46,389 --> 01:45:52,570
another opportunity to take part in this

1590
01:45:48,780 --> 01:45:55,599
tournament which we like so much about

1591
01:45:52,570 --> 01:45:59,110
me I started working as a developer in

1592
01:45:55,599 --> 01:46:01,719
the security company for a hotel I've

1593
01:45:59,110 --> 01:46:07,530
always worked in security and the

1594
01:46:01,719 --> 01:46:11,949
manager in KPMG and I managed team on

1595
01:46:07,530 --> 01:46:14,559
code audits pen test web and mobile and

1596
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:17,019
I'm saying this because you were asking

1597
01:46:14,559 --> 01:46:18,820
me yesterday whether companies value

1598
01:46:17,020 --> 01:46:21,070
that candidates have been to hackathons

1599
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:25,420
where I can tell you that I do value it

1600
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:27,759
so those of you who have decided to take

1601
01:46:25,420 --> 01:46:29,349
part in this hackathon have chose very

1602
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:32,619
well this congratulations and now I'm

1603
01:46:29,349 --> 01:46:36,219
going to talk about our own and what is

1604
01:46:32,619 --> 01:46:38,949
guarded box it's a secret manager online

1605
01:46:36,219 --> 01:46:43,420
secret manager and what is a secret you

1606
01:46:38,949 --> 01:46:48,610
will be asking the password API key pin

1607
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:51,400
cold cryptographic key anything that has

1608
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:53,860
a certain sensitivity and that we want

1609
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:55,690
to keep secret survey a secret and what

1610
01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:56,860
do we do will you raise it on post-its

1611
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:59,589
right so we don't forget

1612
01:46:56,860 --> 01:47:05,079
you know bad idea you have to raise it

1613
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:11,320
on notepad you shouldn't write it down

1614
01:47:05,079 --> 01:47:13,329
anywhere really there are some tools

1615
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:15,449
that can already help us with this

1616
01:47:13,329 --> 01:47:18,780
keypad for example you may know where

1617
01:47:15,449 --> 01:47:21,419
and this tool allows us to keep our

1618
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:24,780
secrets in a local file that is ciphered

1619
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:26,670
by master password and it has some

1620
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:28,530
problems all issues such as

1621
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:46,260
synchronization for example if I want to

1622
01:47:28,530 --> 01:47:49,739
use my password she can buy something I

1623
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:52,650
can send my keypad file then I have to

1624
01:47:49,739 --> 01:47:55,199
give my master password so I'm going to

1625
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:59,610
end up sending it to her through

1626
01:47:55,199 --> 01:48:01,440
whatsapp already back exactly risk if we

1627
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:04,139
want to solve these problems we'll have

1628
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:06,120
to use online Chloe you've got a fear

1629
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:11,190
here on the slide LastPass - lame

1630
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:13,260
password well known more and they all

1631
01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:17,389
have their own issues for example in our

1632
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:21,650
open source so you cannot contribute

1633
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:24,510
faults you can not inspect the code and

1634
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:27,239
obviously a lack of transparency if you

1635
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:29,190
cannot check the code they need to know

1636
01:48:27,239 --> 01:48:30,989
how to do things who used that looking

1637
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:33,900
for information about how they do it but

1638
01:48:30,989 --> 01:48:35,820
sometimes it's just not clear yesterday

1639
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:38,179
for example I was looking for

1640
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:41,460
information on how one password derives

1641
01:48:38,179 --> 01:48:43,560
new information through your passwords

1642
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:45,000
they tell you how to do it that they do

1643
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:47,040
some integrations but they didn't say

1644
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,219
where this comes from or what's the

1645
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:51,840
logic behind it and you can try and do

1646
01:48:50,219 --> 01:48:56,219
reversing on the application but that is

1647
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:58,590
difficult as well most of them have a

1648
01:48:56,219 --> 01:49:01,500
premium functionality so you can always

1649
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:02,760
have a free account and manage your

1650
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:04,890
passwords but if you want to do

1651
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:09,239
something more complex such as showing

1652
01:49:04,890 --> 01:49:14,610
your passwords then you have to be some

1653
01:49:09,239 --> 01:49:18,928
cases security is well and something to

1654
01:49:14,610 --> 01:49:20,610
look into for example with LastPass you

1655
01:49:18,929 --> 01:49:22,590
can share your passwords but wouldn't

1656
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:25,370
you look into the cryptography only

1657
01:49:22,590 --> 01:49:25,370
talks about

1658
01:49:27,469 --> 01:49:33,030
different things and I just want to make

1659
01:49:31,110 --> 01:49:35,159
it clear that's my secrets and no

1660
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:37,769
they're in public and I've had some

1661
01:49:35,159 --> 01:49:38,400
security leaks in the past and I've done

1662
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:41,610
like that

1663
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:43,769
but sometimes there aren't mechanisms to

1664
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:47,400
reset your password which makes me think

1665
01:49:43,770 --> 01:49:50,579
that maybe the master password is stored

1666
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:53,219
and why so I don't like that so what

1667
01:49:50,579 --> 01:49:56,070
happens with guarded box first of all

1668
01:49:53,219 --> 01:49:57,510
it's open source following or keeping up

1669
01:49:56,070 --> 01:50:00,030
with the spirit of this hackathon

1670
01:49:57,510 --> 01:50:02,659
it's free the idea is to have it online

1671
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:05,460
so everyone can use it this full

1672
01:50:02,659 --> 01:50:07,829
interview your users companies it's for

1673
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:09,329
everyone it's transparent to begin with

1674
01:50:07,829 --> 01:50:11,309
because it's open source and you can

1675
01:50:09,329 --> 01:50:13,230
look into the code and also because I

1676
01:50:11,310 --> 01:50:17,699
intend to generate documentation and

1677
01:50:13,230 --> 01:50:21,360
then we'll see and it's also based on

1678
01:50:17,699 --> 01:50:24,089
the best cryptographic standards of the

1679
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:30,780
industry so well as you can see it's all

1680
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:37,230
good and how does this work well in

1681
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:40,860
general the user logs in with password

1682
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:45,360
the front end derives cryptographic keys

1683
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:47,339
symmetric and a symmetric keys and when

1684
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:50,309
we want to keep the secret for ourselves

1685
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:52,710
it takes the symmetric key it's snipers

1686
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:57,360
it on the client side sends it to the

1687
01:50:52,710 --> 01:51:01,349
ciphered encrypted server and the next

1688
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:03,949
day we send the petition we recover the

1689
01:51:01,349 --> 01:51:06,840
data from another server and we can

1690
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:13,489
decrypt it if we want to do this for

1691
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:19,139
someone else and then swear a symmetric

1692
01:51:13,489 --> 01:51:21,928
comes into play and you can ask the

1693
01:51:19,139 --> 01:51:24,989
application to decrypt information for

1694
01:51:21,929 --> 01:51:28,199
certain users so particularity is that

1695
01:51:24,989 --> 01:51:29,879
it's all used from Don from a client

1696
01:51:28,199 --> 01:51:32,369
point of views and it never sends

1697
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:33,000
cryptographic keys or anything of the

1698
01:51:32,369 --> 01:51:38,469
sort

1699
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:43,829
and it's never stored in the device

1700
01:51:38,469 --> 01:51:46,869
turning cryptographic components I use

1701
01:51:43,829 --> 01:51:50,530
different sources so you can see here on

1702
01:51:46,869 --> 01:51:53,768
the slide and I'm going to use for

1703
01:51:50,530 --> 01:51:56,619
example easy C curve two five five one

1704
01:51:53,769 --> 01:52:00,190
nine amongst others concerning

1705
01:51:56,619 --> 01:52:02,530
technologies I can use pretend or react

1706
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:05,199
Java I know you're going to hit hate me

1707
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:06,369
but well some of you like Ivan so you

1708
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:10,570
cannot really say much

1709
01:52:06,369 --> 01:52:17,018
then my SQL this will be deployed in

1710
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:20,018
Google cloud as I said I already

1711
01:52:17,019 --> 01:52:21,519
presented this last year it was more or

1712
01:52:20,019 --> 01:52:24,280
less functional but as you know the

1713
01:52:21,519 --> 01:52:27,610
projects from hackathon sometimes need

1714
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:30,759
to be rethought a little bit so I want

1715
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:32,039
to polish the code a little bit and I'm

1716
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:35,110
also bringing a couple of new

1717
01:52:32,039 --> 01:52:36,420
functionalities I'm sure this has

1718
01:52:35,110 --> 01:52:38,978
happened to you before there many

1719
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:41,229
auditors here you do your audit you want

1720
01:52:38,979 --> 01:52:44,199
to send the report to the client and you

1721
01:52:41,229 --> 01:52:46,840
send it encrypted so you encrypted in

1722
01:52:44,199 --> 01:52:50,589
zip and then you send the password

1723
01:52:46,840 --> 01:52:53,800
through whatsapp right or you just say

1724
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:57,670
to the clown to give you your PGP public

1725
01:52:53,800 --> 01:53:01,630
password and they might either say what

1726
01:52:57,670 --> 01:53:04,479
or to say oh I can't be bothered so

1727
01:53:01,630 --> 01:53:06,999
basically and the secrets right now are

1728
01:53:04,479 --> 01:53:09,809
text but the idea is to be able to have

1729
01:53:06,999 --> 01:53:12,340
files as well and the second

1730
01:53:09,809 --> 01:53:15,460
functionality is to create user groups

1731
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:18,539
so that for example an audit team or

1732
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:21,460
developing team can have access to the

1733
01:53:18,539 --> 01:53:24,670
database password among all of us many

1734
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:26,889
other things I also said I wanted to

1735
01:53:24,670 --> 01:53:28,900
improve it a little bit and change it

1736
01:53:26,889 --> 01:53:32,889
slightly so one of the things that I

1737
01:53:28,900 --> 01:53:35,710
want to do is change the RSA to from

1738
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:40,389
last year to eat see see this year

1739
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:42,519
because RSA is quite slow nowadays

1740
01:53:40,389 --> 01:53:46,920
especially on front-end it would take

1741
01:53:42,519 --> 01:53:46,920
about four seconds to generate

1742
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:56,099
small passwords and over 30 just

1743
01:53:50,910 --> 01:54:01,910
generate a longer one but ECC can have

1744
01:53:56,100 --> 01:54:05,300
the same security but in less time and

1745
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:09,780
also I want to bring a cap Chester Simha

1746
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:11,670
and feeling a bit innovative because

1747
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:13,800
with for some things I was using

1748
01:54:11,670 --> 01:54:17,580
Google's capture but I don't like it

1749
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:18,120
because it's on the front and that's

1750
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:20,490
what I do

1751
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:24,740
other encryptions and I didn't really

1752
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:30,080
trust it that much so I have invented

1753
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:30,080
capture based on cryptocurrency and

1754
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:35,910
basically the front end sees coin and

1755
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:38,160
back end has to verify it

1756
01:54:35,910 --> 01:54:40,559
so that if someone wants to force it

1757
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:42,809
then it will cost them money in

1758
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:45,480
cryptocurrency and this is more or less

1759
01:54:42,810 --> 01:54:47,490
it this is the repository for the code

1760
01:54:45,480 --> 01:55:06,240
and good luck to all the teams and

1761
01:54:47,490 --> 01:55:07,860
thanks a lot muchas gracias a todos

1762
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:11,460
acaba

1763
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:14,040
thanks everyone we're just we finished

1764
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:15,990
just in time so we're going to go to the

1765
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:17,850
hackathon room now just five minutes if

1766
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:20,010
you need to use the toilet or anything

1767
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:23,370
that's when we'll start with the

1768
01:55:20,010 --> 01:55:27,360
question answers rounds which bonuses

1769
01:55:23,370 --> 01:55:34,559
for the first stage and oh this question

1770
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:37,349
is that good in the very first movie you

1771
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:39,630
have been here and very solid projects

1772
01:55:37,350 --> 01:55:44,790
but we also have very new ideas with

1773
01:55:39,630 --> 01:55:45,350
very interesting projects oh and keep up

1774
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:50,909
the good work

1775
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:50,909
[Applause]

1776
01:55:59,620 --> 01:56:01,680
you

1777
