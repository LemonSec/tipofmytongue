please feel free to contact me

96
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,960
normally when we're talking about Wi-Fi

97
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,760
what do you think is when you talk to

98
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,789
people about why fight they say okay

99
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,800
this is what I have at my place but if

100
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,430
you talk to experts in cybersecurity

101
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,120
they think about the neighbors this is

102
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:51,840
the current a scenario that we can

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,640
experience day-to-day also regard nobody

104
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,090
usually thinks about the blue part of

105
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,700
Wi-Fi we I mean if we heard hear the

106
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,640
word Wi-Fi we always think about attacks

107
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:09,420
and about tools in order to access the

108
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:15,780
router or the network so in order to

109
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:17,370
give you a fast explanation I mean for

110
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,169
most of us have friends who are not

111
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,640
working in cybersecurity and they think

112
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:25,410
of us as if we were hackers I'm new here

113
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,270
I'm a newbie I've just started working

114
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,400
in the sector in this professional

115
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,640
sector I'm starting to learn but I'm a

116
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,400
newbie but for my friends I mean they

117
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,430
think that I know stuff and I'm Danny

118
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,859
the hacker you know it's like my surname

119
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,780
I'm cold like that Danny the hacker in

120
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:50,370
him probably it's the same for you your

121
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:55,590
name and then the hacker you know that

122
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:58,410
for you to know my my friends or my my

123
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,960
contacts sometimes one day I went on a

124
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,030
trip with my friends and we didn't hi we

125
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,729
did a half Wi-Fi so everybody started

126
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,010
looking at me and I felt the pressure

127
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:12,960
there I mean they were asking me without

128
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:15,510
asking to get Wi-Fi and I say no I can

129
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,570
do that I that's not legal I cannot hug

130
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,550
the neighbor's Wi-Fi for you to having

131
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:28,890
and someone said well that means that

132
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:30,120
you kind of do it well in the end we I

133
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,060
we got Wi-Fi

134
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:38,280
I got Wi-Fi and that my friends say eh

135
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,680
great I love you so the end of the

136
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,260
stories that we I was not stealing the

137
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:49,740
Wi-Fi from the neighbor I just created a

138
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:54,060
point of access so what I mean with this

139
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,550
story is that besides our cyber secure

140
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,250
our security cyber security colleagues

141
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,880
that know about this stuff for the rest

142
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:05,010
of people this is these are some things

143
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,110
that they do not understand they just

144
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,909
think that Wi-Fi is something that you

145
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,820
have at your place to connect to the

146
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,870
internet or something that neighbor has

147
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,190
so that you can connect to the internet

148
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:22,669
so regarding red teams and blue teams

149
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:30,000
well you know that to detect intrusions

150
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:33,500
in a Wi-Fi networks we use DBS and red

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,560
teams also have different programs that

152
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:44,430
they can use such as the pineapple my

153
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:50,640
fight I don't know if you've heard of

154
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:55,410
this but it's quite cool and you can get

155
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,599
the latest version with leads so if we

156
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,190
are blue team and we want to play a

157
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,200
little bit with Wi-Fi what what are we

158
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:11,010
going to find all the w ideas that I

159
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:13,320
found most of them you need to pay for

160
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:16,320
them there are open stores alternatives

161
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,280
but so far what I've seen is it's not

162
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:25,530
very well developed do Hassan had won

163
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:30,809
the ICC and had won that they had to pay

164
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:33,539
for and then also people can create a

165
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,000
small W IDs in order to detect if

166
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,208
someone else has created a point of

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,919
access or if they want to detect an

168
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,919
authentication of a network

169
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:51,580
then in my final project I learned the

170
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,149
different structures that were more

171
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,279
frequently used and for sure you need a

172
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,709
central panel in which you're going to

173
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,180
visualize everything also this central

174
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,550
panel is going to receive information

175
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,829
from everything around and this is going

176
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,339
to help you buy some type of probes

177
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:12,020
these probes may be different type of

178
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,540
probes and are going to send information

179
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:18,350
to the central panel also in the middle

180
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:21,050
of probes you can try to get waves of

181
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:24,350
the probes and alerts that are going to

182
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,240
send to the central panel and maybe

183
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,709
sometimes the central panel is in charge

184
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,660
of the logic of the application in

185
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:37,130
Canton area that type of others and then

186
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,469
regarding teams whenever I ask someone

187
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,709
what do you think if I tell you Wi-Fi

188
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,570
they are going to say the word pineapple

189
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:49,689
so here are the pineapples that I've

190
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:52,700
used the most the Tetra Wi-Fi pineapple

191
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,399
banana Wi-Fi pineapple and a Chinese

192
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:59,050
copy which is sold in ionised in

193
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:02,209
Aliexpress and then we have the last

194
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:07,660
type of device that in which you can

195
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:11,060
load the pineapple the Wi-Fi pineapple I

196
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:15,829
tried to contact hi-5 the ones that

197
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:18,770
created that device and I was going to

198
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:23,899
bring a pineapple but Warren had an

199
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:26,180
accident and well I just want to say to

200
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:37,220
send greetings to him and I hope

201
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:40,609
everything turns out fine well I'm going

202
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,290
to check the next computer in order to

203
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,290
show you where to buy each device

204
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:08,650
nice nice

205
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:13,510
Victor say well this is hell 5 so well

206
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:15,819
in a few search in Google hot 5 and find

207
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,400
out all your going to be addressed to

208
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,640
the website word in which you can buy it

209
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,770
the Chinese version can be found in

210
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,949
Aliexpress if you look in the search

211
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:28,390
engine of Aliexpress they work pineapple

212
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:30,130
the third option is going to be the one

213
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:32,640
that I've shown you in the previous

214
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,640
slide

215
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,650
ok great

216
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:49,780
this is for you to see these devices

217
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:52,660
well also now it's Black Friday so you

218
00:11:49,780 --> 00:12:00,250
are going to get some discounts if we go

219
00:11:52,660 --> 00:12:04,900
to the product area you can see here the

220
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:09,220
Tetra pineapple and it is also sold in

221
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,079
Apple and this is the Nano pineapple so

222
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,450
then I know it's very cool in order to

223
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,240
play with it but you can just have two

224
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,890
antennas what does it mean that there

225
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,380
are many attacks that may be done

226
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:23,100
through Wi-Fi that cannot be done done

227
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,330
through the Nano pineapple with a tetra

228
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,860
pineapple you are going to have more

229
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:32,020
chances to do more attacks so what the

230
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,150
nano does is that it used one of the

231
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,439
antennas to create a point of access and

232
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,390
through that point of access you're

233
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,390
going to have a panel through which

234
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,340
you're going to be able to launch your

235
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,330
attacks and from and from the other

236
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:55,030
antenna you are going to be able to

237
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:59,260
carry out the attacks I can show you

238
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:01,900
that nor Ameth own or Aliexpress are

239
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,189
paying me for doing these but well this

240
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,779
is the

241
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:09,100
copy the Chinese copy of the pineapple

242
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:25,470
well in this case you have several

243
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:25,470
options okay this is the one a are 150

244
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:33,449
so well this device that he can use if

245
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:40,269
you want to set up your own pineapple I

246
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:44,019
bought this one here so you can buy it

247
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:46,959
with internal antenna and afterwards

248
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:49,180
you're going to need the Alpha antenna

249
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:58,239
because the hardware of the pineapple

250
00:13:49,180 --> 00:14:05,229
has a cheap okay this is for you to see

251
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:07,300
the specifications of the product well

252
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:12,430
so the it yes

253
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:16,990
uses on a are n99 one cheap I think and

254
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:19,750
that's the cheap of alphas as for alphas

255
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,610
Eve if you want to have your own Suites

256
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,790
with all of the gadgets I would

257
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,440
recommend you to buy a suit case such as

258
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,750
this one in order to have everything

259
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,720
more organized so this is the Alpha that

260
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:35,889
I bought the black one it is sold in

261
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:39,370
Amazon but I think it was 23 euros in

262
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:44,190
Amazon and it is not a real one or the

263
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:47,920
best one so I think the cheap ends by L

264
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:51,250
which helps you save more battery but is

265
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,019
less powerful however I bought it in

266
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,829
order to try out and it's working for me

267
00:14:53,019 --> 00:15:00,339
I tried to take the software of the

268
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:04,089
pineapple I loaded it in my glean it and

269
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:07,810
I could work with that if you want to

270
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:12,550
assemble your own sweet the memory of

271
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:14,979
the glean it is 16 by the way and the

272
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,430
new versions for the pineapple regarding

273
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,430
software

274
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:27,410
exceed the capacity of the I air 150

275
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,809
model but when you get what you can do

276
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:35,089
is removing some packages and try to get

277
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:37,790
less than 16 you load it in the glee net

278
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:54,679
and you build your own pineapple in this

279
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:55,939
device thank you but I get bored I'm

280
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:59,240
single opera Pina

281
00:15:55,939 --> 00:16:02,719
well I'm going to show you the version

282
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,809
with the pineapple well I can see that

283
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,579
somebody's creating points of access you

284
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:17,059
cannot see it on the big screen but I

285
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:36,799
can see it from here okay can I go back

286
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:40,509
to the Mac okay so I'm already connected

287
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,509
through the pineapple

288
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:36,770
[Music]

289
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:38,450
with three okay so I'm already connected

290
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,889
to the point of access created by the

291
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:49,270
pineapple in this case the I P of the

292
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:55,910
rotor is 172 sixteen point forty two

293
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:58,940
thirty two point one and the port is one

294
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:04,190
four seven one and this is the panel of

295
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:07,780
the pineapple with the latest software

296
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:12,170
version I didn't find any post in Google

297
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:15,410
about it but you can try out if you want

298
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,880
my notes about failures that I found etc

299
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:19,400
please ask me and I will send the

300
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,200
information that I have on the internet

301
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,790
you can find information about 2.2 or

302
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,760
two point three but this is two point

303
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:29,470
six there are a lot of changes that is

304
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,470
for example a PHP version and it is also

305
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,470
faster

306
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,220
so that's it worth it I mean what's the

307
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,930
difference between nano and tetra or is

308
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,000
it worth it to buy the Nano or the tetra

309
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:58,940
or creating your own pineapple because

310
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,910
everything is done in the pineapple as

311
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,030
for they clean it it took me a whole

312
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:07,040
weekend to assemble it I remember that I

313
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:11,680
was struggling with it for a whole week

314
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:14,540
and I had many failures when compiling

315
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:19,780
etc so it took me one weekend in order

316
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,780
to load the pineapple on the Glee net

317
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,679
and what operating systems may we find

318
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:29,659
when doing audits or working with Wi-Fi

319
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,800
well first time I started working with

320
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:37,370
Wi-Fi I used Y faced like it's like so I

321
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,710
was a kid and I looked on the internet

322
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:43,669
how to hack a Wi-Fi and they recommended

323
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:46,160
Wi-Fi it's like it's quiet updated and I

324
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:48,770
was testing I was playing with it a few

325
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,130
days ago and it works then Kali is the

326
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:55,040
one that we all know and parrot parrot

327
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,750
secure I love a parrot and it is the one

328
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,780
I would recommend there are switched

329
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,580
that do not come by default but you can

330
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,920
download them from the repositories

331
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:08,060
right now in this computer

332
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:13,070
I've brought Kali because I prefer to be

333
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:15,470
safe in this presentation and what I

334
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,850
like the most about kalium I'm going to

335
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:25,880
use the other computer in order to show

336
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:30,740
you can i connect to the other computer

337
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,230
I don't know if you've seen this option

338
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:37,810
from Kali

339
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:43,340
but I love it so Kelly undercover

340
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:48,260
converts a Linux computer into Windows I

341
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:52,300
mean they are you see windows screen and

342
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,300
you can start working with that

343
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:59,500
well I'm going to go back to the

344
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:05,110
previews Carly interface wet well going

345
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:06,850
back to the Mac and talking about

346
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,669
deploying our scenario what are we going

347
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:15,129
to need in order to start playing with

348
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:16,660
Wi-Fi so what did I what when I was

349
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,540
doing my final project what did I need

350
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,980
first of all antennas you have different

351
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,530
type of antennas different brands

352
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:27,310
different sizes the most comfortable or

353
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:29,230
the most convenient point one is this

354
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:32,190
one here which is quite small I don't

355
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,190
know if you can see it properly

356
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:52,830
okay can you see it properly now okay

357
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:54,960
this is like the most popular one a one

358
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:57,419
year in Aliexpress and it works for

359
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,410
Wi-Fi connections it is true that either

360
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:03,870
it's not very powerful a it only I can

361
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,880
only I am only using it in order to

362
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:10,229
connect to the internet then the next

363
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:13,950
size is a little bit bigger and the

364
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:16,049
price is the same and this is the one

365
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,540
here it's also one euro it's more

366
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:20,820
powerful the thing is that people find

367
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,409
more convenient to have these I don't

368
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,360
care about the size I don't care about

369
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,640
people watching the antenna so I've

370
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,409
studied I've started buying these ones

371
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,030
it's true that when you buy an antenna

372
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:33,660
in media mark or someone else somewhere

373
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:38,428
else normally they offer you this type

374
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:42,270
of B devices with an antenna it is a

375
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:43,830
little bit bigger but I think that with

376
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:48,150
this one here that's a little bit

377
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:53,659
smaller I have more power this is the

378
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:53,660
first one that I bought in maybea mark

379
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,179
and I will always remember this moment

380
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,879
because I was a child when I started

381
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:07,110
playing with Wi-Fi I was just a child

382
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:12,990
I went to the media mark to buy this

383
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:16,260
antenna and it it should be useful in

384
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,510
order to use the monitor mode I am or at

385
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,440
least this is what I wanted the antenna

386
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:25,730
for I asked in the store do you know if

387
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:31,500
this antenna can be used to work in

388
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:33,990
monitor mode and I was scared because I

389
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,490
thought that there that they were going

390
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:40,919
to think that I was going to use it to

391
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:43,860
to spy on the neighbor and he asked me

392
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,200
is this is for you to audit right and I

393
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:52,290
said easiest course it's I'm going to

394
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:56,190
use it to audit and also the alphas are

395
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:59,399
very affordable I was even one

396
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,080
I tried it out it worked better that

397
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,020
than these small devices and now I have

398
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,889
to two of them this is the Alpha model

399
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:16,860
with the antenna

400
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:22,080
I bought the tip AR 271 and for me this

401
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:25,379
is the one that has worked the best for

402
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:32,220
me and you can buy it in Amazon for 20

403
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:34,410
euros nine two seven one and when doing

404
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,880
audits I I can tell the difference

405
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:41,250
between these different devices and then

406
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:45,540
you can have a bigger antenna and this

407
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:48,090
one I bought it because one of my

408
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:52,020
colleagues had it I mean I was quite

409
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:55,439
happy with my alpha antenna but my

410
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:58,950
colleague told me what this is too small

411
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,790
and he pulled out this big antenna from

412
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,980
his backpack so I was very happy with my

413
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:09,720
previous antenna and he showed me his

414
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:13,710
and I ended up buying it and it's true

415
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:16,560
that this is way more powerful you can

416
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:21,120
reach way more networks with this big

417
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:25,500
antenna I think it was 12 euros and they

418
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:29,189
all Fontana is 20 euros so for 30 years

419
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:33,840
you can build this small device here the

420
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:36,540
antenna is big I know you need to do

421
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:42,270
audits and you need to move around a

422
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:43,830
building I think it may be to to be but

423
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:46,820
if you are going to be sitting somewhere

424
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:51,199
it's fine

425
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:54,950
so we've talked about the antennas and

426
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:59,490
now I want to talk to you about probes

427
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:02,940
so I always try to automatize everything

428
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:05,130
as my computer is not working very very

429
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,800
well I try to load all the information

430
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,030
on all the devices such as this mini

431
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,490
computer

432
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:17,410
these are the many computers that I've

433
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:21,780
found and that are quite useful russ

434
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:26,170
berrie is the most popular one I think

435
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:29,680
so this is the first raspberry that was

436
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:46,900
in the market the problem is that it

437
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:49,270
only has two USB entries this is the

438
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,080
raspberry number one and the problem is

439
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:54,760
that it only has two ports so if you're

440
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:01,090
going to use two antennas like these

441
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:03,790
ones you can connect the first one and

442
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,500
for the second one you have a very small

443
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:08,290
space and sometimes you cannot even

444
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:11,040
connect it you can connect this small

445
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:13,960
device that I have shown you before but

446
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:17,050
it's not the most convenient thing

447
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,640
actually the next version that I mean

448
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:21,430
the next one that I've bought that I

449
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:27,250
bought was the second version raspberry

450
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:31,900
- raspberry - has more USB ports so now

451
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:34,270
you can connect two of these devices in

452
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:38,230
the USB ports and with this you can

453
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:39,220
create your own probe and it looks quite

454
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,820
cool actually

455
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:45,340
so I usually use two antennas with one

456
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:49,330
of them I use a point of entry and with

457
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:52,689
the other one I start launching the

458
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:56,050
attacks and then we have another device

459
00:27:52,690 --> 00:28:01,810
which is the Hugh box which is very cool

460
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:04,000
these are cube literally we have the

461
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:10,629
same problem as with raspberry one the

462
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,790
USB ports are very closed and either you

463
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,870
use very simple antennas or you cannot

464
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,870
connect more than one

465
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:22,779
also another problem is that in the

466
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,529
raspberry you can have different

467
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:30,399
operating systems but here I try to load

468
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:33,489
the VN version but it is it's not

469
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:38,979
updated these are about 120 euros I

470
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:43,600
think but it is very powerful in I think

471
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:47,019
the manufacturers are an Israeli company

472
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:50,408
you have to order them order these

473
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:53,200
devices and they send these devices to

474
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:56,100
Spain and the other devices you can buy

475
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,100
them on Amazon

476
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:21,190
so this is the key box that I was saying

477
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:23,380
before that it was quite cool well I

478
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:26,230
cannot show it to you but if you look

479
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:30,340
for cube box I that that's the first

480
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:34,299
result you're going to get on Google so

481
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:37,600
what I'm going to do later now I'm going

482
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:39,009
to talk about rotor later I will tell

483
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,320
you the code you know there for you to

484
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:45,789
see what I'm going to do now I'm going

485
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,029
to move to the second part of the

486
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:59,200
presentation which is about Wi-Fi

487
00:29:49,029 --> 00:30:01,870
networks access so the first thing is

488
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,919
doing an evil twin which is creating a

489
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:07,389
point of access which is a similar often

490
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:13,269
PolitiFact access that already exists

491
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:19,658
you know that you see the points of

492
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:24,340
access I can connect to okay I'm going

493
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:26,710
to open up here a terminal so well this

494
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:30,149
is the horse tool I don't know if it

495
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:34,240
rings a bell I'm going to check the

496
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:37,709
active networks here well I'm going to

497
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,710
connect this device here

498
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:49,519
and the tool that I can use that I

499
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:51,139
usually use in order to see what's

500
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,159
happening what's going on is the horse

501
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:59,109
tool this tool is going to help you

502
00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:03,229
monitor all of the packages around you

503
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:05,059
so it's and you know it's monitoring all

504
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:07,549
the parties around us that are being

505
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:12,249
sent and what I really like is that you

506
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:12,249
can filter packages

507
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,629
Oh give me a second please

508
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:50,399
Sepideh

509
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:53,639
okay let's see if I can do it here yes

510
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:56,139
you know giving this as a field throw

511
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:59,379
yeah it's gonna probably take laughing I

512
00:31:56,139 --> 00:32:04,718
miss them but it's you know AI played a

513
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:09,549
filter on post Kiev when you push f you

514
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:12,249
have a mini paddle let's wait for a

515
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:14,469
second to see if it appears I don't know

516
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:17,619
why I can get it you know so you said

517
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:22,499
there should be a mini platter where you

518
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:30,549
can filter there kind of by kind of

519
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:34,629
package one of the most one is Alf here

520
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:37,179
you have the access points okay I'll try

521
00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:39,698
to post it when it appears because I

522
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:44,829
have seen it at this point

523
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:49,059
no jury's response but not request I'm

524
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:51,879
sure you have worked on Skynet so the

525
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:54,009
idea would be identify access points

526
00:32:51,879 --> 00:32:56,678
that we want to replicate and replicate

527
00:32:54,009 --> 00:33:01,949
it with our own device you know that you

528
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:14,399
create an access point the most

529
00:33:01,949 --> 00:33:18,609
comfortable way to do it I will try to

530
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:21,248
make that another user connects to our

531
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:24,819
access point and we'll see what we can

532
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:30,519
do if we have enough time okay I go back

533
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:35,049
to muck then after every tween boy

534
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:39,009
wouldn't try to connect to corporate

535
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:45,789
networks to enterprise networks my

536
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:48,559
colleague was great at it and in the

537
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:51,799
beginning I had the option to

538
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,320
we use free radius for the

539
00:33:51,799 --> 00:34:01,220
authentication part in Khalid you have

540
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:04,639
some repositories which offer free

541
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:07,909
radius in within the same package in

542
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:17,210
order to do this attack I'm going to go

543
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:23,270
back to Kali it will be the host abd I

544
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:30,740
don't know where I had it so host

545
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:40,639
Appetit WP there was letter missing

546
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:44,118
there because I had it over here before

547
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:48,290
testing it okay here so we have a host a

548
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:51,800
PDW PE and then the user and the

549
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:55,639
password will appear if you don't is the

550
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:59,420
bag this is d setting up the

551
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:03,619
configuration because later we're going

552
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:09,079
to set the host APD I'll tell you how

553
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:11,770
the most known enterprise network is the

554
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:18,260
University one which would be a Durham

555
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:23,450
this access point is going to create the

556
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:28,760
a the access point called Elohim I don't

557
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:31,730
know if I have it here so we will create

558
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,390
the access point at the ROM and anyone

559
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:39,140
who has a doodle in their mobile phone

560
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:41,810
track record then they will try to

561
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:47,690
connect to this point to this access

562
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:56,950
point what I'm going to do is to work on

563
00:35:47,690 --> 00:36:07,470
hosts in this computer yes I

564
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:09,939
did the configuration file and us

565
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:27,549
interface I'm going to use the allele

566
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:30,960
and - okay it's done why is what I can

567
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:38,710
do is to reset to restart the network

568
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:43,270
manager I don't know why it doesn't

569
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:45,310
allow me to start there w land here it

570
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:59,470
should work but I don't know why it

571
00:36:45,310 --> 00:37:02,859
doesn't otherwise that go back to it

572
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:04,750
later and we can make some progress now

573
00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:07,000
I think that's a good call

574
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:10,210
so I go back to mark you know the to

575
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,890
continue the presentation can you go

576
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,890
back to mark on the screen

577
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:26,019
Molly our finale

578
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:28,420
Karen poon talks so in the end the most

579
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:31,288
useful thing to create an access point

580
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:35,980
apart from making the user to connect

581
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:38,289
them to our network is to trick them so

582
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,269
that they give us as much information as

583
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:43,599
possible so the most common thing is to

584
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:47,558
replicate known portals if my company's

585
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:50,289
name is McDonald's so the login portal

586
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:53,680
should be Suckley the same as the

587
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:57,220
McDonald's one in the captive portal

588
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:01,538
here we have another option we can recur

589
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:04,419
to browser hooks there is an quite

590
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:07,990
interesting app deviis I think it's a

591
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:12,009
bit it's not quite updated and you can

592
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:15,549
do it with web hook the idea would be to

593
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:19,660
have in the active portal a scraped

594
00:38:15,549 --> 00:38:23,319
which would upload a JavaScript file in

595
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:25,269
order to lift the web hook and on the

596
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:29,890
other side it would contain several

597
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:33,129
instructions and depending on these

598
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:37,629
structures receive it would perform one

599
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:43,539
activity when a task or another okay so

600
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:47,740
in the end this is sending code to the

601
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:53,140
user or trying to activate the webcam or

602
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:57,640
the microphone or any other thing so as

603
00:38:53,140 --> 00:39:01,450
for follow-up or a triangulation the

604
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:06,220
most comfortable thing is to when you go

605
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:09,460
to a company is to see the heat map in

606
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:14,140
order to see from what part of the

607
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:16,980
company you will have easier ways to

608
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:21,150
make people connect to your network

609
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:23,859
another option is to triangulate people

610
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:27,180
there are several ways to do so in my

611
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:28,819
final project I used several raspberries

612
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:33,290
so

613
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:37,190
I placed those raspberries at certain

614
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:39,830
points and I knew all the traffic around

615
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:43,100
me and or the excess bones around me so

616
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:48,680
you can more or less see how they figure

617
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:52,910
out how they are working you need to

618
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:55,640
know the power in a certain point when a

619
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:58,879
package is being sent another option is

620
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:02,299
what was done in London the header is

621
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:07,850
quite controversial and what they did

622
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:14,180
was to create access points in bins bins

623
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:16,819
were registering MAC addresses from

624
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,549
those devices which were trying to

625
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,800
connect through these access points

626
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:25,670
these beams were placed at strategic

627
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,620
points and could track MAC addresses and

628
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,850
they could track their movements

629
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:35,330
afterwards another thing was quite

630
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:40,089
controversial hackers use Wi-Fi signals

631
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:44,180
in order to monitor the victims so a guy

632
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:48,760
took a probe and placed it in front of

633
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,759
the house of another person and can see

634
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:57,950
the power of the packages to see if it

635
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:01,190
is normal standard or if it changes us

636
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:05,629
for intensity okay

637
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:08,000
physical access I told you before this

638
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,880
is my favorite part and I was willing to

639
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,420
get to this point later we will see the

640
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,330
web and the probes and the code I called

641
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:21,800
these for physical access you know that

642
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:26,090
you mean to refer to hard words to play

643
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:31,820
with them the most popular one or at

644
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:35,960
least the most but one is dozer this the

645
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:38,590
author I'm gonna change your computer

646
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,590
okay thank you

647
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,450
it's alright

648
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:54,180
and time so nice Chris I'm gonna enter

649
00:41:51,810 --> 00:42:05,070
Aliexpress for a second in order for you

650
00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:08,390
to show the gadget so much advertising

651
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,390
on this website

652
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:18,839
actually this is the one that people

653
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:21,870
usually buy so what does this gadget do

654
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:24,120
it costs 11 euros but I think you can

655
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:28,049
find it for nine okay so this gadget

656
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:31,440
allows you to authenticate any user from

657
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:37,980
any network that you select and what is

658
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:42,480
it for coding attacks on many occasions

659
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:46,320
you need to listen to users in that same

660
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,200
network the easiest way to do it is to

661
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,960
have a computer and an antenna or you

662
00:42:49,200 --> 00:43:08,279
can use some of these gadgets they want

663
00:42:51,960 --> 00:43:12,570
that I borrowed the one that I borrowed

664
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,550
is a version that guy called Pedro from

665
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:25,200
the university Complutense a of Madrid

666
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:32,310
built is this thing what the guy did was

667
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:38,580
to build his own printed circuit can you

668
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:42,020
see it he bought in Aliexpress the

669
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:45,990
buttons the screen and the Wi-Fi model

670
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:49,470
the code is free open source so you can

671
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:53,310
find it indeed hub and is what you see

672
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:54,450
here and what does it allow us to do on

673
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,480
the one hand

674
00:43:54,450 --> 00:44:02,430
we can see everything that is going

675
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:05,160
around us a now it only shows the

676
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:07,740
packages with our beam sent it doesn't

677
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,339
indicate the power and it is on channel

678
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:13,709
11 okay I go backwards and what I'm

679
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:20,279
going to do is to scan networks around

680
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:27,410
us a piece and then it will scan all the

681
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:31,579
networks it was fast as you saw and then

682
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,578
once I've got the network

683
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:44,420
30 networks so I'm going to select one

684
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,420
of them this one for example

685
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:05,970
okay this one and you could perform the

686
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:07,890
attack on the network that you have

687
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:15,779
selected in this case it is going to be

688
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:24,029
to authenticate I know you're seeing the

689
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:33,750
screen in Reverse I'm sorry and in this

690
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:38,250
case we press Start so to get did is

691
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:40,859
going to send the elf to all the clients

692
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:44,099
or users which were connected to that

693
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:46,200
network in order to make them disconnect

694
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,869
this is quite comfortable in my

695
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,390
university we had a problem with was

696
00:45:48,869 --> 00:45:54,510
that in order to connect to the network

697
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:59,339
the range of ips was quite limited so

698
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:03,000
when a number of users the maximum

699
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:06,360
number of users had been reached

700
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,510
you were disconnected from the network

701
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:12,330
so the alternative was to disconnect and

702
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:15,330
try to connect again in order to

703
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:19,880
disconnect on all the user but what does

704
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:23,730
this gadget do we could authenticate

705
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:26,940
that user so that they could keep on

706
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:31,520
studying another of the gadgets that I

707
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:35,130
love is Wi-Fi key logger key logger

708
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:40,050
collects characters that were typing on

709
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:45,050
our keyboard from all the options that I

710
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:45,050
have seen the coolest one is this one

711
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:59,040
can you see it our drave k-loader I'm

712
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:17,820
going to go to Cali to the other

713
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:18,300
computer please okay this is the the

714
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,990
author

715
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:25,950
this is diversión de the size that

716
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:28,350
everyone buys but the code is free so

717
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:30,689
you can build whatever you want as my

718
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:36,330
colleague did there are some people who

719
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:38,010
buy the the author in clock size so

720
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:40,650
every time they want to authenticate

721
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:44,670
somebody they sell they scan the network

722
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:46,470
select a network and disconnect all the

723
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:49,740
other users you know that you are

724
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:53,220
authentic eight others an Amazon some

725
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:57,439
current I would I think it costs 40

726
00:47:53,220 --> 00:48:04,560
euros in Amazon I do not quite remember

727
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:07,550
but in Alex Press is 23 euros this is

728
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:11,400
not a premium option but you can also

729
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:16,710
send it through premium option and it

730
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:21,530
works as follows as you can see is super

731
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:21,530
tiny let's see if you can

732
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:29,790
it's tiny tiny there are even smaller

733
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,640
versions and all the bigger versions

734
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:35,220
this is you cannot connect that to a

735
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,839
laptop because it catches your attention

736
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:45,118
but if you do it on a desktop computer

737
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:47,430
it doesn't attract your attention when

738
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:51,150
the gadget is connected to the network

739
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:54,379
it opens an Access Point and then you

740
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:56,850
can see the logs of what it's right in

741
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:00,600
there are several versions of this

742
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:03,710
gadget this is let's say the most

743
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:07,200
standard one because the gadget creates

744
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:11,310
an access point and when you connect to

745
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:13,950
it you can see the registry and there is

746
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:16,650
another version I think it is the pro

747
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:19,379
version that makes you connect to the

748
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:21,810
network and you don't need to access it

749
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:31,410
you receive all the information in your

750
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:36,060
email account ok so in this case in this

751
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:38,270
case this is my gadget I connect the

752
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:47,009
keyboard I'm gonna try it with Bluetooth

753
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:52,070
let's see let's try with the Bluetooth

754
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:52,070
one I'm going to go to Cali here it is

755
00:49:54,109 --> 00:50:02,759
ok let's see if I have an USB entry and

756
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:07,819
connected so the access point which is

757
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,820
going to be created just give me a sec

758
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:15,060
I'm gonna have the Mac on the one side

759
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:20,720
we this is already connected I go to the

760
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:27,710
map and I'm going to connect my mark to

761
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,709
the access point created by the gadget

762
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:40,760
it is conducting connected these opens a

763
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:44,940
portal which shows the blow the logs

764
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:48,510
performed as the user types let's try

765
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:53,340
with Bluetooth keyboard I'm gonna

766
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:57,600
refresh it and it should appear and this

767
00:50:53,340 --> 00:51:04,770
is what didn't work this morning because

768
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:06,660
I managed to figure out that it was

769
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:09,530
collecting information written in

770
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:12,930
English so if you type in a Spanish type

771
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:16,290
keyboard maybe it doesn't collect all

772
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:19,109
the information this morning I tried

773
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:21,900
with manual keyboard instead of a

774
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:24,480
Bluetooth one and it could register

775
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:28,230
everything that was being typed then you

776
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:31,370
can also set the gadget up in order to

777
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:37,470
change the name of the access point or

778
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:40,230
even to enter a password the if you're

779
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:43,529
doing it in a company you can name it as

780
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:50,480
the name of the company or as the name

781
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:53,270
of the network used by the company as

782
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:56,010
usually you can see this is quite easy

783
00:51:53,270 --> 00:52:11,470
here the version sends you this

784
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:13,720
information to your email account it

785
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:17,350
right

786
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:21,520
no they said yeah okay and then after

787
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:23,140
these keylogger this Wi-Fi key logger

788
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:27,580
and there is another thing which is

789
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:30,220
quite cool this is a version of rubber

790
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:35,860
ducky but it doesn't have the same

791
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:39,069
design this one here these catches more

792
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:45,070
attention because it is bigger you can

793
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:47,380
see the difference right what is this

794
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:50,020
one going to do the good thing is that

795
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:54,580
it creates an access point you connect

796
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:58,150
the gadget to the laptops users you

797
00:52:54,580 --> 00:53:04,390
connect to the panel via web and you

798
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:07,180
type what that computer should type it

799
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:09,310
is a version of rubber ducky with an

800
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:12,759
external access point so you don't need

801
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:16,930
to save the instructions here you can

802
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:21,150
send the instructions through typing I'm

803
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:32,350
gonna show you it takes a little bit to

804
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:37,330
create the access point okay yes and

805
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:40,210
here it is in this case the password it

806
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:42,580
is a default password but since I'm

807
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:45,730
going to connect to my own computer I'm

808
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:48,610
not going to share my password in order

809
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:54,340
to prevent somebody from sending data to

810
00:53:48,610 --> 00:53:58,480
my computer okay this is my IP this is

811
00:53:54,340 --> 00:54:03,910
the password and this is the IP to send

812
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:07,450
information as I was saying there are

813
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:09,930
cooler panels in your mobile phone if

814
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:15,220
you connect to the access point

815
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:19,620
the reason up I mean this is all free

816
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:19,620
this is this up

817
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:29,040
you can select the computer I am using

818
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:37,170
Linux can you see it I don't know if you

819
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:44,370
can if I can adjust the zoom okay so

820
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:46,980
from here you a tf2 ATL f2 and then once

821
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:50,130
you have your terminal in the other

822
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:51,930
users laptop from this application you

823
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:54,300
can type whatever you want on set into

824
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:57,029
the laptop in this case I'm going to use

825
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,460
the desktop that it has it is not as

826
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:02,480
cool as the application itself

827
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:07,470
can you see it right okay in this case

828
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:08,550
I'm going as sick to Cali to the other

829
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:15,180
computer okay

830
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:18,290
so clear done and I always wrote it as

831
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:21,419
Who am I I already have to tell me now

832
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:24,029
the distribution of the keyboard in

833
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:27,560
Spanish is not well recognized but it is

834
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:34,620
in English but if I go back to my mark

835
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:39,930
can you show Mac yes thank you so Who am

836
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:42,600
I and I send the text so from Cali from

837
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:46,230
the other computer it wrote Who am I

838
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:50,880
so I go back to the Mac and you can do

839
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:55,710
whatever you want it has options for the

840
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:59,160
mouse you can press enter so the command

841
00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:02,580
should be executed you have special case

842
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:06,240
or shortcuts in order to reach the

843
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:09,930
terminal or for other options the

844
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:14,279
easiest way to do it is well here there

845
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:17,940
is none is payloads you can have a miny

846
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:20,280
scraped in order for it to be connected

847
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,910
to the laptop I want to execute this

848
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:28,160
script and the computer will execute it

849
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:30,950
in this case the best the best is alt f2

850
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,210
with Linux

851
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:41,970
terminal and then you type whatever you

852
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:46,980
want the script literally is print two

853
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:49,350
points or print time two points and the

854
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:52,490
only thing to take a look at is key

855
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:58,490
species but is this quite easy to use

856
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:58,490
the you can find these on al Express

857
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:20,270
let's see if it loads I don't know if I

858
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:20,270
typed it correctly

859
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:28,080
[Music]

860
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:41,730
let's see if I find the other one I

861
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:41,730
brought so close this window

862
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,760
$1 connector which answer

863
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:20,210
Estes awesome so here they are what I

864
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:23,090
recommend is I'll Express if you just

865
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:26,390
want to play with them on I think there

866
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:30,140
are Black Friday offers because I found

867
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:33,560
it on Amazon but it cost 30 euros and

868
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:36,770
you can find it for 13 euros in

869
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:39,590
Aliexpress quite different my

870
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:42,830
recommendation is that the version that

871
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:44,840
used so before is not very updated but

872
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:48,190
it is quite as stable if you just want

873
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:54,860
to play with it take the stable version

874
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:58,390
2.3 I'll Express as always offers in the

875
00:58:54,860 --> 00:59:01,040
description the different code

876
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:06,040
repositories that can be deployed within

877
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:12,080
the device and every one has its own

878
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:16,340
features the one I recommend to ya is

879
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:18,860
this one here this is the one that the

880
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:22,460
owner the application itself has and

881
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:26,570
it's the easiest to use with injector

882
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:29,330
Wi-Fi injector and here you have the

883
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:32,450
application that I showed you earlier if

884
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:36,380
you connect this to a computer from your

885
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:38,149
phone you can access the access point

886
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,870
and from the application you can play

887
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:44,480
with the other users laptop

888
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:47,000
the thing about loading the code for

889
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,760
example this one specifically the weekly

890
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:54,200
comes from Windows and Mac in order to

891
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,950
configure it then what is the other

892
00:59:54,200 --> 01:00:02,089
option

893
00:59:54,950 --> 01:00:08,810
the alternative is DDS packs which cost

894
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:10,820
one gyro for the

895
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:16,970
who don't know what this is I'm gonna

896
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:20,960
show you these things over here the good

897
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:23,450
thing about these is that you can enter

898
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:26,000
instructions on its memory and those

899
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:28,700
instructions are going to be executed it

900
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,660
doesn't have a huge memory because the

901
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:36,859
rubber one had a small card memory card

902
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:42,620
however you can do basic things look at

903
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:45,260
it it's quite small this one is the size

904
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:48,470
of the width more or less and this is

905
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:50,270
adidas part these one creates an access

906
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:53,450
point and executions instructions you

907
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:56,000
type in these once connected is going to

908
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:59,990
execute immediately the instructions it

909
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:05,270
has in its own memory so what do people

910
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:08,140
do so they have bought a chip they have

911
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:13,370
bought it and they stick them together

912
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:17,900
this one comes already set up it is true

913
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:22,549
that for example if you do a video on

914
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:27,620
boy called Pedro who explains step by

915
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:33,770
step to assemble this digispark this one

916
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:38,779
here I don't know if you can see it and

917
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:42,100
these are quite easy to use the problem

918
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:44,660
is that the rubber and the keylogger

919
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:47,900
catches your attention if you connected

920
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:50,390
to an users laptop you can use social

921
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:54,200
engineering like I need a file that it's

922
01:01:50,390 --> 01:02:00,170
here and then when he is not looking you

923
01:01:54,200 --> 01:02:05,839
can load the instructions and and

924
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:08,420
execute your orders your commands the

925
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,850
another problem that I found is that it

926
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:13,280
is quite slow if you try to send

927
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:13,880
instructions it can block and can do

928
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,670
anything

929
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:19,550
sometimes it takes 13 seconds and you

930
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:20,590
need parade to type it in the computer

931
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:23,590
so even if

932
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:27,850
say to the user this is a normal USB

933
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:31,270
stick you are if you're lucky it's fast

934
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:34,029
and then nobody realizes it but if it's

935
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:37,450
slow it can take 1 minute 1 minute 20

936
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:41,110
and then you are in trouble I try to do

937
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:49,270
it once but destruction is not my best

938
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:51,550
weapon this part without why fight in

939
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:56,500
which you can implement a Wi-Fi module

940
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:59,500
as the this boy did with these deals and

941
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:02,740
then you have these this module you see

942
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:06,610
you can stick them together to the digi

943
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:08,799
spar board in order to simulate what is

944
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:12,270
in here and you can deploy the code in

945
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:15,790
the same way this D alpha has a code

946
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:19,300
with already existed but they built this

947
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:34,180
circuit and this one has its own free

948
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:37,540
code so this is one of the add-ons which

949
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:39,100
is quite cool when starting working in

950
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:41,200
an organization there are companies that

951
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:45,430
do not have theater so you can create an

952
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,569
F if ATP and with the white device that

953
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:50,040
I've shown you before the most

954
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:53,890
convenient thing to do is to write

955
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:56,460
Python - an HTTP server and you can

956
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:59,259
navigate with all throughout all the

957
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:02,350
directories you can also connect it you

958
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:03,700
can explore the SH H key and you have

959
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:08,140
already access and this is the way of

960
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:15,370
doing past audit and also regarding the

961
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:18,580
information is if they may label it's

962
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:19,650
filtering for mithoon so well about

963
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:22,630
information I'm going to talk about

964
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:25,930
leaking information so if there is a

965
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:27,820
package who is blocked and that has HTTP

966
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:32,049
service there they don't have internet

967
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:34,090
service sir access you can feel the

968
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:35,980
early information through Wi-Fi

969
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:37,870
so the most convenient thing is to have

970
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,400
a Wi-Fi channel so every time you're

971
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:42,190
sending a package you know that you are

972
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:45,760
saying the destination IP they're eating

973
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:48,910
IP their MAC address and set of data

974
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,460
that can be modified since from name up

975
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:53,950
one of the options to avoid firewalls is

976
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:59,050
to modify the headlines and to put

977
01:04:53,950 --> 01:05:04,089
random IPS in this case what's more

978
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:07,480
simple here is to take the last value of

979
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:09,640
an IP value that represents on a string

980
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:12,850
value so you say every package with that

981
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:14,560
MAC address this is the IP and I'm going

982
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,410
to read the last value value and that

983
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,029
value is going to be represented by a

984
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:20,799
character I do a simple script with that

985
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:24,940
value and this is going to create our

986
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:30,160
text attacks and this in another option

987
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:33,550
that we have is to create our Wi-Fi

988
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,990
covert channel and what's good about

989
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:38,890
this one is that you're not going to

990
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:40,509
this packages because it is going to

991
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:43,330
recover all the packages that you may

992
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:44,680
have lost so because sometimes when

993
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:47,290
you're monitoring the traffic you may

994
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:49,210
lost these packages but the one that you

995
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:51,910
can see here on the screen that was

996
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:55,440
created by Yago avoids losing this

997
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:58,120
information you create here one single

998
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,040
point of access and with your I mean

999
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:02,290
with your own network card you can

1000
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,420
connect and you can send random packages

1001
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:07,330
through the network and that's it

1002
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:10,570
you get three three scenes an nmap or

1003
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:13,120
through s copy you can edit your parties

1004
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:16,030
and do a script with those tools also

1005
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:19,000
something else would be using a drone

1006
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:22,120
which is more high-tech what do I mean

1007
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:25,570
with that many drones work with Wi-Fi

1008
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:29,109
function with Wi-Fi these drones have an

1009
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:31,540
IP and you can even see how the Android

1010
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:33,760
app works in order to try to manipulate

1011
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:35,620
it or create your own version if you

1012
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,910
want to play with that I bought recently

1013
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:42,810
and a our drone from parrot I'm going to

1014
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,810
use the other computer

1015
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:58,440
I would say my cuenta it s so well this

1016
01:06:55,530 --> 01:07:00,600
is quite useful because the IP is free

1017
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:03,090
you can play with that it has an Android

1018
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,370
application and you can manipulate the

1019
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:08,490
drone in this case

1020
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:10,710
well it's 89 us in media markt but I

1021
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:13,410
bought it in water pop so I got it

1022
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:15,930
cheaper and I was playing with it and

1023
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:18,359
these can create a point of access the

1024
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:20,100
AR Drone you can exit that point of

1025
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,720
access and you can send all the

1026
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,900
information in this specific model

1027
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:27,270
besides the API from parrot you also

1028
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:29,790
have different libraries even in Python

1029
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:34,620
that are ready so that is we can one

1030
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:41,210
command you can give orders and tell the

1031
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:41,210
drone okay move backwards upwards etc

1032
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:48,110
but well this is just for fun and an

1033
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:57,270
oddity it's not going to use drone ever

1034
01:07:48,110 --> 01:08:00,750
another option is for example if you are

1035
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:03,660
connected to a network that the ICMP

1036
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:05,940
packages can be modified you can get

1037
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:08,220
that modification and by intercepting

1038
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:12,740
the traffic from another device you

1039
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,740
can't you can see what you've been doing

1040
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:28,769
and these are the type of encryptions

1041
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:31,349
that there are so this is the most

1042
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:34,170
simple one and almost nobody uses this

1043
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:37,350
there is some public places that have

1044
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:39,660
this type of encryption but almost

1045
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:42,660
nobody is connected if there is this one

1046
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:47,160
client you can force traffic in order to

1047
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:50,970
achieve the password so years ago a long

1048
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:55,349
time ago this was widely used and people

1049
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:57,330
have their own applications that allow

1050
01:08:55,350 --> 01:09:01,319
them to access different routers for

1051
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:06,839
example I don't know but six years ago I

1052
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:09,330
think I was kind of paranoid so I I was

1053
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:12,660
trying to find out what was going on in

1054
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:14,580
my network and at one point I was

1055
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:17,189
analyzing my network it was where it was

1056
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:20,640
working very slowly I watched that it

1057
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:23,849
was a device connected and I realized

1058
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,800
that a neighbor of mine could access my

1059
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:29,839
own network and there was no encryption

1060
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:34,339
with HTTPS back then so in the end I

1061
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:34,339
could see everything that was going on

1062
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:46,680
wpa wpa2 is are the most used

1063
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:49,020
encryptions right now and well with that

1064
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:51,000
you are going to need as many parties as

1065
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:54,089
possible and with the higher number of

1066
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,770
clients the best so their idea is to

1067
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:59,400
connect different packages and to try to

1068
01:09:55,770 --> 01:10:04,130
break that network in order to obtain

1069
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:17,490
the password so I am going to turn on my

1070
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:22,190
own router here you want a minute all

1071
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:26,550
right and also there is the WPS through

1072
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:28,200
pin3 pin this is quite cool because see

1073
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:30,900
this reader is quite cool because you

1074
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:36,410
can modify it and write any type of

1075
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:36,410
encryption even though even WEP

1076
01:10:39,659 --> 01:10:44,549
whatever so funny

1077
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:27,400
next time buddy esta casa y Anthony our

1078
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:30,010
club okay I it's connected well now

1079
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:32,559
you're not watching my computer because

1080
01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:36,130
I don't want to show you the

1081
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:40,530
configuration of my own water I've seen

1082
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:40,530
two web web encryption

1083
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:31,179
but Molly is a chameleon sorry August

1084
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:38,050
I'll Cisco so here you can see the

1085
01:12:31,179 --> 01:12:44,650
encryption I'm going to try to do this

1086
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:47,909
from Callie I'm going to move the

1087
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:47,909
terminal over here

1088
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:14,650
este caso got a horse to run say well

1089
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:18,630
I've chosen as host you all to so I'm

1090
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:18,629
going to take here to a one

1091
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:42,460
but now gonna in mono monitor so this is

1092
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:46,040
my monitor mode some area here would be

1093
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:48,850
to capture the market is from the rotor

1094
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,850
I've just created

1095
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:23,860
there's a mystery bin Hasaan yeah so

1096
01:14:21,219 --> 01:14:28,210
what's going on this is almost the same

1097
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:29,980
as the headline of their host in host

1098
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:43,239
you can see what's happening regarding

1099
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:44,250
parties and that stuff let's see if I

1100
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:48,489
can make it bigger

1101
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:53,770
okay here it is so this is the one

1102
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:57,299
that's interesting to us Fisk oh I think

1103
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:57,300
this is the one that we're going to use

1104
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:07,500
so okay I'm going to keep this one

1105
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:15,810
journalist number one can you see the

1106
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,809
terminal

1107
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:04,889
my lady asked aqui para seasons so the

1108
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:08,080
idea is to see the packages that are

1109
01:16:04,889 --> 01:16:10,420
city in the ruler and the clients there

1110
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,650
are no clients here right now but I'm

1111
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:15,760
going to try to generate some traffic

1112
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:25,900
with the raspberry and you will see

1113
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:34,590
these now on the screen ok I'm

1114
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:34,589
connecting I'm going to use the keyboard

1115
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:41,909
now I'm going to try to connect to the

1116
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,909
router

1117
01:16:47,619 --> 01:16:52,380
okay let's see if I can see the network

1118
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:10,809
okay I'm going to try again it didn't

1119
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:10,809
connect

1120
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:24,070
okay it's not working but well the idea

1121
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:30,220
is to generate some traffic in order to

1122
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:33,420
try to put more packages on the web

1123
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:35,830
network with all of these packages I

1124
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:40,410
mean if we don't have enough packages we

1125
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:44,200
can try to force a false authentication

1126
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:47,370
but the main idea once we have the I

1127
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:52,540
craft sweet sweet sweet and enough

1128
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:57,730
pocket is about 550 thousand beacons we

1129
01:17:52,540 --> 01:18:01,300
would obtain the key now we would need

1130
01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:04,719
to reach to 50,000 beacons but we are

1131
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:06,400
about we're having just about 1,000 and

1132
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:12,730
it's taking a while let's see if I can

1133
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:15,969
connect one more time the key is quite

1134
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:19,410
simple actually but let's see if I can

1135
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:19,410
connect it raspberry

1136
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:34,190
okay somebody a good access I don't know

1137
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:42,050
who who is it please try to generate

1138
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:46,119
traffic so the key is facing police one

1139
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:46,119
two three four five six seven eight nine

1140
01:18:50,619 --> 01:19:02,299
if we in order to try to accelerate

1141
01:18:54,229 --> 01:19:04,999
these I do you have a shell they're open

1142
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:08,179
did you do it from your mobile phone

1143
01:19:04,999 --> 01:19:18,199
okay with an application well if we want

1144
01:19:08,179 --> 01:19:20,920
the traffic to increase faster let's see

1145
01:19:18,199 --> 01:19:20,919
if I can show you

1146
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:42,590
like a sauna Cisco it won't you know

1147
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:43,940
engine that was my dear a just came

1148
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:47,000
gentle Swati

1149
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:48,620
well later we will try to introduce the

1150
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:51,590
credentials of the client on the user

1151
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:54,290
and we would force the rotor to look

1152
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:56,750
more packages in order to reach 50,000

1153
01:19:54,290 --> 01:20:10,269
beacons with that figure we could get

1154
01:19:56,750 --> 01:20:11,870
the password the key so the other option

1155
01:20:10,270 --> 01:20:14,120
wpa2

1156
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:22,780
I'm going to change the properties of

1157
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:22,780
the rotor let's see if I can connect

1158
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:40,460
so if you change the configuration in

1159
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:44,570
some devices I mean there are two type

1160
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:55,490
of attacks and one in order to force our

1161
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:58,400
PA packages ARP packages well it's and

1162
01:20:55,490 --> 01:21:02,809
the other type of attack is generating

1163
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:07,700
traffic to and and because when there

1164
01:21:02,810 --> 01:21:11,660
are more packages we can try to force in

1165
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:20,900
order to get the password okay I'm going

1166
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:23,990
to use this computer now okay let's

1167
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:27,589
leave this here and let the let's do

1168
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:29,570
something else while the ones that could

1169
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:32,330
connect try to generate more traffic

1170
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:56,090
let's see if we can reach five 50,000

1171
01:21:32,330 --> 01:22:02,269
beacons okay okay this is for you to see

1172
01:21:56,090 --> 01:22:05,290
the code I'm going to show it to you now

1173
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:05,290
in the big screen

1174
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:29,150
okay I want this one here

1175
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:48,579
when I staccato well please let me see

1176
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:49,269
the Mac screen again okay well later

1177
01:22:48,579 --> 01:22:52,630
later

1178
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:55,540
I will share with you this coat here so

1179
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:57,610
the idea is that this is going to

1180
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:59,260
calculate the traffic it's going to feel

1181
01:22:57,610 --> 01:23:00,098
we're going to filter taking into

1182
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:03,880
account the packages that are

1183
01:23:00,099 --> 01:23:09,060
interesting to us here have some of the

1184
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:12,400
packages we can use reese's reading in

1185
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:14,920
no I mean the final project is read any

1186
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:18,098
note and when we have the packages I'm

1187
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:20,800
going to send them through sockets so I

1188
01:23:18,099 --> 01:23:22,449
have the portal of the kind open all the

1189
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:32,679
time and this allows me to know what's

1190
01:23:22,449 --> 01:23:33,219
going on and I'm going to establish some

1191
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:37,389
rules

1192
01:23:33,219 --> 01:23:42,340
if this request I can launch warning if

1193
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:46,179
I see that data or there is a point of

1194
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:51,780
access that is sending strings that are

1195
01:23:46,179 --> 01:23:55,300
named as my database I can launch danger

1196
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:59,019
so this is regarding probes and coding

1197
01:23:55,300 --> 01:24:03,010
of probes and in order for you to see

1198
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:07,449
what usually works better regarding

1199
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:10,860
Wi-Fi right teams we can create another

1200
01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:14,949
point of access with a panel or

1201
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:26,699
duplicating a panel so I was on the

1202
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:26,699
train recently sorry I'm going to type

1203
01:24:28,139 --> 01:24:31,590
active portal

1204
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:01,880
by other Internet

1205
01:25:02,220 --> 01:25:06,230
okay I don't have internet access here

1206
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:12,809
give me a second please

1207
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:17,459
I'm going to try to connect in interface

1208
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:19,410
there they have a point of access this

1209
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:21,750
point of access redirects you to our

1210
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:28,790
website that they have created through

1211
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:32,660
which you need to feel a template or

1212
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:32,660
request with several data

1213
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:05,700
so this is the portal that I was

1214
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:09,210
explaining and that I was mentioning

1215
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:12,929
that if a portal portal they request

1216
01:26:09,210 --> 01:26:19,700
many information here many pieces of

1217
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:34,500
information such as details such as name

1218
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:37,710
surname email address ID number this

1219
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:42,590
point of access was not even certified

1220
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:45,900
so anything that you could send was okay

1221
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:48,200
they you can anyone can replicate that

1222
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:53,429
website can create a point of access

1223
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:55,590
with this website and it would work what

1224
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:57,510
I mean is that anyone can replicate that

1225
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:59,460
point of access anyone can launch that

1226
01:26:57,510 --> 01:27:02,550
point of accents and anyone can steal

1227
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:11,070
that data so you have to be careful with

1228
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:13,290
that so we probably the rotor has

1229
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:18,110
changed password so we would have to

1230
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:18,110
reset it I'm going to stop using it and

1231
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:34,790
well as we'll have much time I'm going

1232
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:40,500
to leave it here and this is our chaos

1233
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:42,450
these is the doom presentation but well

1234
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:44,489
I hope that at least you've learned

1235
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:46,980
things from the Gotcha startup that I've

1236
01:27:44,489 --> 01:27:48,870
shown you and that you may probably need

1237
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:53,989
regarding Wi-Fi you can do many things

1238
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:57,390
regarding heat maps or triangulation or

1239
01:27:53,989 --> 01:27:58,860
regarding also sending off information

1240
01:27:57,390 --> 01:28:01,560
so I would recommend you to play with

1241
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:05,219
all these things I finally I'd like to

1242
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:07,500
thank in Steven for letting me doing

1243
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:09,949
this presentation in spite of their

1244
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,600
technical problems that I've had

1245
01:28:09,949 --> 01:28:13,309
also I would like to thank Adriano a

1246
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,920
colleague of mine a friend of mine I

1247
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:17,690
guess gave me the mat material through

1248
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,580
which I was able to start my final

1249
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:22,699
university project so I would like to

1250
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:25,670
thank my s2 group and colleagues because

1251
01:28:22,699 --> 01:28:27,980
they were encouraging me to give this

1252
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:30,980
presentation I could show the station to

1253
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:32,949
them in advance so well in this case I'm

1254
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:36,259
going to finish my presentation here

1255
01:28:32,949 --> 01:28:38,080
because reconfiguring the rotary takes a

1256
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:42,580
long time and I don't have a lot of time

1257
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:45,969
but of course if you have any questions

1258
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:45,969
please ask

1259
01:28:53,350 --> 01:29:02,810
LeBron that ok I have a question do you

1260
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:05,710
know how Noguchi the tamagochi of I feed

1261
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:08,540
on is it yeah I don't know the name but

1262
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:10,100
it would have been cool to see that -

1263
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:12,650
yeah I have a colleague of mine that is

1264
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:16,730
working with that but I've never done it

1265
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:18,589
so I prefer to show things that I was

1266
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:21,620
familiar with but yes of course I want

1267
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:25,310
to try that it it's quite cool the only

1268
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:28,449
thing is that there are data published

1269
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:30,140
regarding host use in the polarity etc

1270
01:29:28,449 --> 01:29:33,110
okay thank you

1271
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:35,420
good to know so can you watch there can

1272
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:45,679
you what's the code yes you can okay

1273
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:47,210
thank you it's good to know that the

1274
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,280
ones that I've tried or the ones that

1275
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:51,500
I've shown you there are many much more

1276
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:54,400
gadgets but it depends on what you want

1277
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:54,400
to use of course

1278
01:30:03,670 --> 01:30:11,840
well again once again you've seen my

1279
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:18,639
contact details up here so please feel

1280
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:18,639
free to contact me so well my idea is to

1281
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:23,540
publish the information that I shown you

1282
01:30:22,099 --> 01:30:25,130
about the pineapple but if you want to

1283
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:26,750
start playing with the pineapple please

1284
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:29,090
ask me questions I can send you the

1285
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:31,460
information that I have you have to

1286
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:34,159
compile with the CCC and you have to see

1287
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:36,800
the latest updates of the SAP software

1288
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:39,799
of the pineapple and change that

1289
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:46,820
information so that you can work with

1290
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:48,770
that so well this is it

1291
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:51,230
I hope you enjoyed my presentation and

1292
01:30:48,770 --> 01:30:53,150
that you've learned things so thank you

1293
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:56,079
for coming please a big round of

1294
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:56,079
applause for the nyan

1295
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,700
[Applause]

1296
