2
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:20,880
good morning to you I would like to

3
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:24,509
thank in TV and cyber can and all the

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,039
entities that are supporting initiatives

5
00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:34,620
of this kind it's very very important in

6
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,030
the field of cybersecurity in just a

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,459
moment we will begin with the

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:44,929
presentation and as our colleague was

9
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,300
saying my name is Yvette Oliver I'm

10
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:52,399
founder of a community called Attica

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,959
hacker hacking ethics and female hackers

12
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,219
and I'd like to talk a little bit about

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,969
him Horton's

14
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:06,060
data and the issues that exist in terms

15
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:11,490
of cybercrime specifically in Spain in a

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,850
short period of time in seven years 2011

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,520
to 2018

18
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:22,009
we've gone from thirty six thousand two

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,310
hundred and ten thousand cyber crimes

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:28,140
increase has been absolutely huge and

21
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:34,020
it's clear that there is an issue that

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:36,750
we have to deal with right away and

23
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,100
talking about this data I would like

24
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:45,650
also to talk about my project and how it

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:50,759
started out I was a victim of

26
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:53,560
cyberbullying myself and this led to me

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:59,710
looking into creative solution

28
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:02,650
in order to try and simply resolve this

29
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,839
and stop other people having to go

30
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,640
through the same situation that I went

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,209
through

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:13,900
Atika hacker was my thesis project for

33
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:18,000
my degree and I've tried to use the

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:22,030
project to do a bit of a mixture to mix

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,600
concepts and alternatives and above all

36
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:31,350
in order to focus on solutions creative

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:36,790
solutions that are also constructive I'm

38
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:42,880
lucky enough to have had a an excellent

39
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:47,250
result for my project and in every event

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,440
that I go to it's really a real

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:54,510
satisfaction and to know that time

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:59,019
giving something back and preventing

43
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:02,920
through knowledge and education the

44
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:09,549
trajectory of this project has been

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:12,880
since 2017 and it has been a great hunt

46
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:16,980
of resilience for me attempting to try

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,200
and get something positive and nice

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:27,250
something gratifying out of a situation

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:31,540
that really marked me at the time I also

50
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,820
want to promote positive thoughts for

51
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:38,548
people who may go through such a

52
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:43,120
difficult situation as is cybercrime or

53
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:51,660
cyberbullying we can all be victims of

54
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:57,030
this and it's important in my opinion to

55
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,030
transmit what I lived in first person

56
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:06,488
and above all in terms of managing my

57
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:10,129
devices and as a result etiquette hacker

58
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:13,430
focuses on education but not educating

59
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:16,668
just in anyway the idea of the concepts

60
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:20,478
in this project is to transform the

61
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:23,630
information take to take difficult

62
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,719
concepts and transform them into

63
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:30,350
information for a basic user and give

64
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,470
them a visual aspect it needs to be

65
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:37,699
something that's easy to understand and

66
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:41,620
even fun and can be distributed across

67
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:46,130
all social networks and all digital

68
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:48,740
platforms in a free and open manner I

69
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:51,800
think this is incredibly important for

70
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,530
the project because my ambition for this

71
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,060
project is that all the content should

72
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:03,260
reach all audiences mothers fathers

73
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:06,740
children adolescents older people we all

74
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,950
manage a number of devices and through

75
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:19,900
education we can prevent many many

76
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:23,719
issues here we have the presentation and

77
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:26,900
we have some important data here and we

78
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:31,419
can get an idea of how cybercrime has

79
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,419
evolved here over the last few years

80
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,210
put up some recent headlines here

81
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:45,260
regarding this issue

82
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:49,419
cyber crime there are issues happening

83
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:52,310
in other companies in the in the country

84
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:56,030
cybercrime in Spain only three percent

85
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,699
of cyber crimes are resolved in fact a

86
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,159
number of cyber crimes are not even

87
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,080
reported because there are a lack of

88
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,970
information because people are

89
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:10,800
embarrassed and for many different

90
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:14,849
reasons at least two students in

91
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,199
each class undergo cyberbullying they

92
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:21,150
suffer cyber bullying here in Spain

93
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:24,030
cyber bullying is a big issue currently

94
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,568
and this can have a huge impact on

95
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:32,489
people because it's 24 hours a day 365

96
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:34,460
days a year there is no rest there's no

97
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:39,389
way of getting away from one cyber

98
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:41,878
bullying and this is why I'm so

99
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:48,330
committed to this project to try and

100
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:50,810
cover the needs of people and for this

101
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:55,080
issue that needs to be resolved quickly

102
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:58,370
and also dissemination of photos

103
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,680
intimate photos is being investigated

104
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,440
and this is an important issue because

105
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,949
there is a lack of education in order to

106
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,740
prevent issues of this kind we need to

107
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:15,620
talk about values as well so the base

108
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:18,889
basis of this project is ethical values

109
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:22,529
transparency being clear Liberty

110
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:25,830
creativity passion and access to

111
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:28,710
information these are the initiatives

112
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:36,770
that we are taking with our project and

113
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:39,539
everything is based on these values I

114
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,750
spoke a little bit about the origin of

115
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:45,750
the project and the initiative so the

116
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,330
inspiration I was talking about the

117
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:52,590
ethical values amongst the hacker

118
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:59,789
community and during the course of this

119
00:07:52,590 --> 00:08:03,000
project since 27 15 I've seen that it's

120
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:07,680
very important to promote the hacker

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,710
culture and hackers themselves in my

122
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,770
particular case in the situation that I

123
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:16,440
underwent at the time the only response

124
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:21,198
the only piece of support that I was

125
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:24,080
given and that came from hackers

126
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,180
they were a wonderful community and it

127
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,409
was great that they could give something

128
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,930
positive to society when I met the

129
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:36,578
hacker community I realized there was a

130
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:40,069
kind of a stigma behind the word hacker

131
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:43,880
but my experience told me that this was

132
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:50,680
very unjust so there's a section of the

133
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:53,060
project that's called hacking we aim to

134
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,069
disseminate information about all these

135
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,069
profiles and the community of hackers

136
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,970
all of the people have excellent

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,430
backgrounds excellent experiences and

138
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:10,880
they make a very positive contribution

139
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:14,060
to our society that's the experience I

140
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,860
have had as a basic user and this is

141
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,989
what I would like to transmit through my

142
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:27,040
project resilience is also important to

143
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:29,779
me this project is resilience itself

144
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,880
it's very important to get something

145
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:38,990
positive out of everything and to me

146
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,640
this project is amazing it gives me life

147
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,930
I feel like that I'm helping but I'm

148
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,630
doing something positive and I did have

149
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:50,420
a an awful situation and I'm very aware

150
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:55,579
of everything that can happen in the

151
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:57,979
world of cybersecurity do research every

152
00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:02,589
day I study a lot every day and I try to

153
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,589
project this in a free and open manner

154
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:14,300
so what's the vision in this project

155
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:18,589
it's educate protect help and there are

156
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:21,579
very specific objectives so educate and

157
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:24,589
protect in order to prevent cybercrime

158
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:29,870
to be a channel of support for affected

159
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:32,720
users when this happened to me I wasn't

160
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,360
able to reach out to precipitate

161
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,569
who could give me support and helped me

162
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,180
to resolve the situation I couldn't find

163
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:44,060
anybody specialized in cybersecurity I

164
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,920
would come across her buta scientist but

165
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:50,649
he or she would not know anything about

166
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:53,930
cybersecurity and even when I wanted to

167
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:56,389
report the situation the person that I

168
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:59,000
came across to me did not seem to have

169
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:01,279
appropriate training in this field so

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,920
all of these situations that I went

171
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,699
through is what I'm trying to deal with

172
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,819
through this project this is the idea to

173
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:16,128
cover those gaps that I came across

174
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:18,050
during my journey and I want to people

175
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:24,430
to understand more about the hacker

176
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:28,219
community and their values it's a

177
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:31,279
positive community and it's an

178
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,500
opportunity to give something back in

179
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:38,180
the issues that we have day and day it's

180
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:40,879
protecting privacy protecting data we

181
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,279
have to empower basic use users so that

182
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:49,040
they can take decisions regarding their

183
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:51,740
life online it's probably something that

184
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,240
we don't see today but probably we will

185
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,089
see in the future

186
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,889
that's the there are certain profiles of

187
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:00,379
certain people that could cause issues

188
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:03,829
in the future we can see this through

189
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:06,970
stories we can see this in day to day it

190
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:09,079
is highlighted in the press some of the

191
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,600
stories of the truths that have come out

192
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:14,059
recently and these are things that we

193
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:24,470
need to empower or through information

194
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:26,990
and through education if I can

195
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:30,199
understand this as a basic user anybody

196
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:34,819
can understand it I'm a graphic designer

197
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:37,420
and multimedia designer and I want

198
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:41,209
people like me to be the filter for the

199
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:43,370
for the content of this project it's

200
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:46,400
very important that it should be

201
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:48,860
basic and easy to understand easy to

202
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:53,930
read and easy to distribute through all

203
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:56,630
the platforms that we can all use we

204
00:12:53,930 --> 00:13:02,060
will have classroom based workshops with

205
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:06,189
all of this content protecting this is

206
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:09,530
also very important and I'd like to

207
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:15,470
disseminate all the tools and platforms

208
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:17,750
that we have in open software free

209
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,570
software this allows us to have greater

210
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:23,000
transparency about the information that

211
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,430
is contained within them we need to have

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,910
more control over our data so it's very

213
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:32,050
important that basic users know the

214
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:36,260
options that are available to them in

215
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:39,430
free software it's also about giving out

216
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:43,250
manuals giving information in order to

217
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:47,180
prevent and protect support

218
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:50,300
it's about guiding people who have been

219
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,069
affected giving them support through

220
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,270
professionals institutions and

221
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:59,210
specialist associations little by little

222
00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:02,480
I have seen that associations and

223
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:05,900
entities come together and they're

224
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:10,310
coming together to give this support I'd

225
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:13,970
like to mention stop haters these

226
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:17,479
colleagues do an excellent job and what

227
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:20,480
they try to do is mitigate hate on the

228
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,370
Internet these projects and these

229
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,050
institutions exist because it's an issue

230
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,890
that we need to deal with as soon as

231
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:31,099
possible in all ways possible we need to

232
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:33,439
have channels links and references of

233
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,500
contact people so that people who have

234
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,440
been affected we can be given guidance

235
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:44,330
and a way of dealing with their problem

236
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,190
I suffered over time because I didn't

237
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,140
find the appropriate hell that I needed

238
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:52,100
so this is why this section of the

239
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:54,250
project is so important to me and over

240
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,130
time I've been in contact with different

241
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:59,820
entities in order to achieve this

242
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,820
collaboration

243
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:08,530
hacking this is one of my favorite

244
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:13,720
sections because I've truly loved the

245
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:17,709
hacking community these have been open

246
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,540
people to me they are passionate about

247
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,260
their field and they want to share their

248
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:26,890
knowledge they truly want to create

249
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:29,560
something that helps Society and this is

250
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,330
something that I truly love and I love

251
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,400
being in contact with the hacker

252
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:37,900
communities getting to know different

253
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:42,540
profiles it's so wide the field of

254
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,540
cybersecurity and I absolutely love it

255
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:52,180
I want hackers to be able to experience

256
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,690
--is give advice talk about their

257
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,540
projects so that they can invite other

258
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:05,040
future generations to study the degrees

259
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:07,410
that our digital society needs police

260
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,630
departments our entities need

261
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,189
professionals who can give the responses

262
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:17,470
that I needed and they can give

263
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:20,020
solutions to these issues I wanted there

264
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,970
to be a space where young people can get

265
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,790
interested in hacking they can find

266
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,100
information inspiration valuable

267
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:31,599
information and important events in the

268
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:35,230
sector even hacking challenges all based

269
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:39,190
on safety so that they can channel their

270
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:45,940
curiosity in a positive way this is all

271
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:50,010
I insist aimed at basic users some times

272
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:52,510
people are afraid of facing a CTF

273
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:54,220
because they are afraid they run away

274
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:59,550
and but in fact the reality is quite

275
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:02,320
different so this is prepared from the

276
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:06,190
from the point of humility and

277
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,110
from a basic uses we want to say look

278
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:11,260
this isn't quite as difficult as you

279
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:15,520
think the CTF exists and go ahead go and

280
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:19,810
try it and now I'd like to hand over the

281
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,190
floor to my colleague who was talk a

282
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:25,389
little bit more about this section of

283
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:28,120
the project thanks a lot Evette well I

284
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,890
had to come in when we were talking

285
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,020
about hacking this is what I did this is

286
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,730
why I love I've been working in this

287
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,580
profession for a really long time and

288
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:42,130
obviously I love hacking I am a hacker

289
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:45,399
I've always been so we would like to get

290
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,920
rid of the ethical ethical hacking

291
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,620
because we always have to write ethical

292
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,660
hacker on our TV but it's only not to

293
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,159
get people scared because there are

294
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,100
people who still get scared so we write

295
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,230
like I am a good hacker I am an ethical

296
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,459
hacker and fortunately this is not the

297
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,760
way it should be

298
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,850
we shouldn't have to use ethical with

299
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,560
hacker is like saying I'm a good

300
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:12,750
policeman or I'm a good carpenter

301
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:17,409
we'll know or in an ethical carpenter I

302
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:19,780
could be making Knights to kill people

303
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,700
it's not necessary but unfortunately in

304
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:26,680
the last few years we have had to link

305
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:29,260
or ethical part to hacking I know what

306
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:38,890
event has been doing since the very

307
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:42,520
beginning you typical activist hacker

308
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:48,760
sorry about the music well as I was

309
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:53,730
saying god the life is really cool we're

310
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,730
always in labs researching working what

311
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:02,220
we do much much more and one of the

312
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:09,280
things that almost all my hacking

313
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:11,890
colleagues do is help others this is an

314
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,500
example of what we do in our free time

315
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:18,309
in our last one we got you we are very

316
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,590
funny will with playing with little toys

317
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:25,330
we love the hacking things and this is

318
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:27,250
how we spend our free time well as I was

319
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,980
saying I know the project since its

320
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,899
inception I have been supporting it

321
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:36,070
because it's very necessary I to support

322
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:39,340
many other projects as well which are

323
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:43,059
not the profit of course and of course I

324
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:44,799
am supporting event on this one because

325
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:46,720
we've been looking for is something

326
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:55,450
really beautiful it's not for profit and

327
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:58,409
I feel not concerning much more than we

328
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:00,340
used to hearing it is not only and

329
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:03,610
computer guy who knows about

330
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:06,189
cybersecurity and researchers analyzes

331
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,168
and exploits vulnerabilities

332
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:12,490
hacking or a hacker can be almost

333
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:14,919
anything find a different way of using

334
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:19,779
things of modifying things that's where

335
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:22,600
the content break the toys and from that

336
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:24,220
toy they get all the contents all the

337
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,100
engines lowlights and they make

338
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,110
something new or someone who changes the

339
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,719
way something functions there it changes

340
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:36,459
the way it functions so it is a very

341
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:38,950
much more complex concept than just some

342
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,409
computer guy and this is it I didn't

343
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,350
really want to steal event time because

344
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:46,990
she's really the protagonist of this

345
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:50,289
project and I'm really from the bottom

346
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,269
of my heart everyone will support

347
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:53,919
because it's a beautiful project that

348
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,250
she's doing you're not the Prophet very

349
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:03,250
important thank you thank you very much

350
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:07,990
a goal that's lovely thank you so so

351
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:10,899
much for your work as you know well Yago

352
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:14,500
is a very good professional he is a

353
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:17,860
great hacker and I really thank you for

354
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,860
taking part and for your works because I

355
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,510
this is really a picture of what ethical

356
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:28,120
hacker is and how they contribute

357
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:33,220
positively to society I confess that in

358
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:36,789
my business cards add them back sentence

359
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:40,480
that says hacker it's not a criminal

360
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:44,169
it's our digital world's superhero and

361
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,940
this is how I would like to pass on this

362
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:50,529
whole concept this is how I would like

363
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:52,480
people to understand this concept and

364
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:56,470
now we're going to talk about the

365
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:00,070
ethical hackers community we have around

366
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:03,279
70 people 70 wonderful people nowadays

367
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,840
who are supporting these projects and I

368
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,880
would like to thank them from here thank

369
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,789

370
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,070
support for your encouragement for your

371
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:14,620
love I'm sorry I'm getting a bit

372
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,289
emotional and for your love for

373
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:20,649
everything we have shared with me it's

374
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:23,559
amazing thank you so so much and we have

375
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:26,830
different professionals who specialize

376
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:30,428
in cybersecurity technicians hackers

377
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:34,840
trainers orientates psychologists

378
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:38,110
graphic designers video producers market

379
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:41,320
experts to name but a few of the

380
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,658
professions my idea is to have a

381
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,539
comedian of concept different

382
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:49,269
professions because everyone can really

383
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:53,260
add something to cyber security and to

384
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:55,389
the issues that come with without cyber

385
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:57,970
security I think the more point of even

386
00:22:55,389 --> 00:23:00,760
more - the more concepts we have the

387
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:03,279
better for everyone what is a hacker for

388
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,649
me it's someone who is passionate about

389
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:09,690
once they do regardless of their

390
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:13,018
profession it could be a Smith a

391
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:18,010
carpenter and this is I read from a book

392
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:21,800
PEEP @pk him Amman which is called

393
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:23,750
hacking ithaca ethics and this is

394
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:29,600
available on the internet and i really

395
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:34,460
really like the concept that it gives

396
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,260
the importance of mixing professions so

397
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,660
that we actually achieve the objectives

398
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:43,180
of our project now what do we expect

399
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:46,790
from this project in the near future

400
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:49,520
well from next year onwards we're going

401
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,250
to generate quality constants that are

402
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,430
easy to understand for basic users and

403
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,710
which will be distributed among among

404
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,540
all social networks and digital

405
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,780
platforms and this is key for me because

406
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:04,280
we all use the social networks and we

407
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,530
know the potential that they have and

408
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:13,120
why not use it for something that really

409
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:15,649
does educate and help we will also have

410
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,040
workshops and we have been doing

411
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:21,710
workshops in the last few years

412
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:25,010
usually on-site workshops and the idea

413
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:27,860
to take all these cool and fun content

414
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:31,870
that we're going to produce and use them

415
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:34,399
in workshops and at schools high schools

416
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,770
universities any sort of entities

417
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,960
because the idea is to take this at the

418
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:44,540
national level and to have the greatest

419
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:47,870
impact on society as possible we will

420
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:51,200
have materials skies easy-to-use

421
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:53,929
applications and we will have different

422
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,570
alternatives depending on the users

423
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:59,390
needs and amongst them this is very

424
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:02,179
important open source applications that

425
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:06,560
we seem to have forgotten and that are

426
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,650
very important to empower basic users we

427
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,690
will have specific channels with

428
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:16,770
collaborating entities to give effective

429
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:19,710
support to all those users affected by

430
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:21,810
shoes concerning cybersecurity and to be

431
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:25,140
honest in the last few years through our

432
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:27,210
website st Kanaka dot-com i have

433
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,790
received many different cases people who

434
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:32,940
have approached me to ask for help in

435
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:36,930
different occasions and the idea is that

436
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,460
this help is as broad as possible that

437
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:40,950
it reaches as many people as possible

438
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,990
and even to have follow-up to really

439
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:46,140
know that that person is getting an

440
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:49,440
effective answer to their situation

441
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:52,310
which is a very painful situation we

442
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,510
will have exposed video and written

443
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:57,510
interviews with hackers which have fun

444
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:59,250
which am very close to young people so

445
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,280
that they have positive references and

446
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:06,420
to encourage young people to access the

447
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:08,070
profession in the hockey sections there

448
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:11,160
is a very important area that I would

449
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:15,570
like to highlight where hackers woman

450
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,040
hacker hacker and wife I think it's

451
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,990
important because I think there should

452
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:24,629
be more women in cybersecurity my vision

453
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,910
with the start of the project is to give

454
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:29,400
visibility to women who really work in

455
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:31,650
this industry the many wonderful women

456
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,800
with really cool projects that I think

457
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:36,840
should be known and recognized for what

458
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:41,159
they do and also at the same time

459
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,970
encourage girls to study and to get into

460
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:47,840
these professions that are so needed in

461
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:50,910
our society and now here I would like to

462
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,419
introduce some of the wonderful 70

463
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:57,240
people that now part of our etiquette

464
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:00,000
hacker community was a different profile

465
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,670
since the more we are the merrier

466
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,270
because together we do more we can

467
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:10,860
achieve more and I really truly truly

468
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:12,870
would like to thank everyone it's all

469
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,270
these wonderful people who are not only

470
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,729
supporting and collaborating this

471
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,830
project but who are also encouraging me

472
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,410
in particular so much and I get very

473
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:26,260
emotional when I talk about this because

474
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:28,480
it is something that I really live

475
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:34,030
and that I enjoy and that is why I talk

476
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:36,340
about resilience and we would also like

477
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:41,649
to use this platform and the streaming

478
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,639
to call on two people like many or like

479
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,580
all these people who are already

480
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,240
collaborating to join our community to

481
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:52,210
add the little something and the

482
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,520
knowledge and to bring new ways of doing

483
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:57,570
things we need psychologists in this

484
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:01,629
hacking world because we're a bit crazy

485
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:04,600
we need to generate more educational

486
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,720
materials we need to teach from schools

487
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,310
this is key it's crucial because

488
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,240
everyone who works in cyber security

489
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:16,780
have seen dramatic situations around us

490
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:19,600
we have known cases which are very close

491
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:23,980
to us I personally have seen people very

492
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:27,760
close to me who have suffered harassment

493
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:31,360
cases who have ended up in suicide this

494
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,390
is tragic this is horrible and it is due

495
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,600
to a lack of education and a values from

496
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:42,460
the very bottom of society we need to do

497
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:45,550
this since we are children we need more

498
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:48,940
people to take part we all were very

499
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:53,139
complimentary and to infi babe because

500
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:56,590
in Phoebus work is runs really parallel

501
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:59,410
to we're doing and we are establishing

502
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:01,959
communication and collaboration channels

503
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:04,150
within spirit and we really need to

504
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,530
change things and the only thing that I

505
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:08,860
would like to ask is because this is a

506
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:11,590
very open community and very generous

507
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,320
community when it comes to the things

508
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:16,510
that we do we don't we're not only

509
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,030
interested in in money and with this I

510
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:21,820
include my friends and many of you who

511
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:25,300
are here all we want is to help society

512
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:28,870
as much as we can and we do believe that

513
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:31,090
we need changes and because we can seee

514
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:34,040
around us we can analyze what's going on

515
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:37,909
around us that is our work as hackers

516
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:40,040
that is our job as well and so all of

517
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,520
you who would like to work with us

518
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:46,520
you've got the website ethical hacker

519
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:49,940
calm we are completely open to any sort

520
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,850
of applications from everyone in every

521
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:58,280
sector and sorry if it and I'll give you

522
00:29:52,850 --> 00:30:00,320
the flu again well at the beginning we

523
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,970
had some technical problems with the

524
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,310
presentation but I would like to

525
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:08,750
highlight now that the Kazakh would like

526
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:11,300
to also be a link to between communities

527
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,640
since I started with this project I have

528
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:17,480
been going to events to collaborates

529
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,700
with communities with organizations I'm

530
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,080
getting really involved I'm learning a

531
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,360
lot I love moving tables plugging in

532
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,659
cables whatever we need to do we can all

533
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,120
share so we can all enjoy free access to

534
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:36,890
information which is what really

535
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:39,729
characterizes hackers well right now

536
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:43,970
Atika hacker has been in different

537
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:52,280
communities and organized events for

538
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:54,470
example hack Madrid which stop haters

539
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,090
the Association I mentioned hello

540
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:00,119
earlier we're also working hand-in-hand

541
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,119
[Music]

542
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,200
hacker is also getting a lot of support

543
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:09,920
from people who have taken part in cyber

544
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,590
world and also from modern year black

545
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,490
foundation in he horn riders an

546
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:19,879
internship and they are really really

547
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:24,170
concerned about the issues that this

548
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:28,190
project tries to tackle and they

549
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:32,330
actually lent me their facility so I

550
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:34,910
could leave cybersecurity workshop steps

551
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,770
and I thank them for that as well Libre

552
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:40,210
lab is another association I would like

553
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:44,810
to mention they are focused on reducing

554
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:46,240
people closer to open-source so where

555
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,460
has girls and

556
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,970
some Columbia bees like great girls

557
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:56,380
wonderful girls who give it all in their

558
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:59,200
country to go forward and to improve in

559
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:04,000
all these areas which I'm going to say

560
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,890
it again this is not an industry work

561
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,810
women are very prescient and I think we

562
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:13,390
need to change that in the benefit of I

563
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:14,770
would also like to stop and think and

564
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,590
make people who are finishing their

565
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:20,139
studies think about the importance of

566
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,360
getting all the knowledge that they have

567
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,640
acquired during their students and

568
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,260
applying them to have positive changes

569
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,440
in society I think this is really really

570
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,650
important

571
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,540
think about what you didn't like of the

572
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:37,120
things that you see around you how can

573
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:45,010
you solve it and usually the craziest

574
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:46,899
idea is going to be values and skills

575
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,620
that are linked to cybersecurity

576
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:52,560
professionals farther than technical

577
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:56,310
skills this is very important because

578
00:32:52,560 --> 00:33:01,750
clearly the issues behind cybersecurity

579
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:04,659
linked to society they have a very big

580
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:10,420
impact on society and this is why I

581
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:15,730
think this project really is fulfilling

582
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:17,080
needs but I know currently being met we

583
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,650
want to be surrounded by beautiful

584
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:23,860
people wonderfully beautiful people

585
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:26,560
every time you start a project yet

586
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,199
surrounded by people who give something

587
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:33,639
to you that encourage you you make you

588
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:36,430
move forward any sort of counter I'm

589
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:39,250
starting a project is a bit complicated

590
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:42,730
and I know it's a bit difficult but it's

591
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,740
not really like that you if you do

592
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:47,050
something from passion from love

593
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:49,310
something that you didn't get money from

594
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:51,620
but say you do anyway that you

595
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:53,780
didn't sleep one night and you invest

596
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,570
all the hours that you have on it

597
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:59,840
because you love it and finally I would

598
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:02,510
like to encourage all of those who would

599
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,639
like to take forward there there's no

600
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:08,570
projects please do not give up do not

601
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:12,130
give up fight for what you believe in

602
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,130
and for what you want

603
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:24,939
well I'm gang emotional again sorry and

604
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:28,279
we're going to open the question round

605
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:31,010
very soon but thank you really thank you

606
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,600
very much to all those who volunteer the

607
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,450
work and those of you who want to

608
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,770
volunteer the work with us our door is

609
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:39,319
always open

610
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:42,759
concerning communities we have seen for

611
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,440
many years from hacking community

612
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:49,370
different communities and there's always

613
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:53,260
some rough patches and issues that arise

614
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:55,940
amongst them that is natural it's

615
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,860
something that happens because we all

616
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,840
think in a different way but what is

617
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:06,350
really important is when we get together

618
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:09,080
to create solidary generous and educated

619
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:11,660
educative project because all

620
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:15,170
communities absolutely every single

621
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:18,500
community is invited to take part in in

622
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:20,950
projects such as this one exactly I

623
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,200
think it's very important to combine

624
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:27,109
forces because India and we all have

625
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,569
very similar objectives and I really do

626
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:32,540
hope that editor hacker can be a

627
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:37,430
wonderful link between community so we

628
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:39,680
can create more fun things and for

629
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:42,379
people's to get to know the hacking

630
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:50,120
culture so that we can all hacking this

631
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:51,980
culture we the question round you have

632
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,480
any questions about the community but

633
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,790
