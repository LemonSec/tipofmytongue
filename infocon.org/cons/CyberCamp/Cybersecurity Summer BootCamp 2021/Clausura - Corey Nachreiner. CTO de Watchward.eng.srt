00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,600
hello curry

3
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,199
good afternoon how are you hello welcome

4
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,440
yes good afternoon or morning for me i'm

5
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
fine thank you

6
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
and corey could you explain to us what

7
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,040
the

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,439
what's work experience is about

9
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,320
ransomware

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,279
and other cyber crime cyber crime models

11
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,000
yeah so my experience i'm currently the

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
chief security officer of watchguard

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,920
technologies and i previously was the

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
chief technology officer

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,600
and i've had 22 years in cyber security

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,079
and basically our company makes cyber

17
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,680
security products for mid-market

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,040
organizations

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
and doing that we see a lot of telemetry

20
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,799
from attacks happening

21
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,720
around the world and we sell through

22
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,560
partners who tell us the attacks that

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,479
they see against their customers

24
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,880
and as you see today i i today i'll be

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,119
talking about the four top concerns of

26
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,280
businesses in north america

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,119
uh largely based on the attacks we're

28
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,320
seeing in the wild

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,600
so uh please go ahead with your

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,439
speech cool so if i was going to go

31
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,240
ahead and start

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,079
of course today thank you for your time

33
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,600
today good afternoon

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
uh today i'll be talking about the four

35
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,520
the top four business cyber security

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
concerns we see in north america

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,680
as we just mentioned my name is corey

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,280
knockriner i'm the chief security

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,720
officer at watchguard

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
been at the company for many years and

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,879
also been in information security for

42
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,680
years you know

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,879
starting kind of as a small penetration

44
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,720
tester and hacker who went to all the

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
black hat and defcon

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,879
conferences and becoming eventually a

47
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,560
manager and director of security

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
strategy and research until i got the

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,680
c-level role

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,720
so really kind of your typical cyber

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,599
geek

52
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,680
and technology geek which got me really

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,760
interesting in protecting the technology

54
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,519
that we all use and love

55
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,040
and by the way thank you so much for

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,959
bearing with the english presentation i

57
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,000
wish i could speak this

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,440
spanish and portuguese and other

59
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
languages as well as you guys could

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,319
so for today's agenda i'm going to cover

61
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,200
the four

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,920
top threats that we are really fighting

63
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,599
here in north america at least from the

64
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,040
business level so these are more

65
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
business focused threats than say

66
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,519
state sponsored or government threats

67
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,200
and the four threats which i'll go into

68
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
a lot of detail on

69
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,000
one is evasive malware as you know when

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
attackers break into the system they

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,959
want to establish

72
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
persistence and they use malware to do

73
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,879
that malware has gotten

74
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,200
very evasive it uses different

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
techniques like living off the land or

76
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
fileless malware techniques which i'll

77
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
talk about to hide

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
the next problem is digital supply chain

79
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,680
attacks

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,440
you've probably heard of those lately

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,040
between solar winds

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
and the cassaya attack which i'm not

83
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,879
going to go into those two in detail

84
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,080
because i'm sure you've heard a lot

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,280
about them this week

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,599
but i will include them as some of the

87
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,680
many digital supply chain attacks that

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,000
have been

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
happening over the past four four to

90
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,519
three years these attacks are really

91
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,200
important because they're even

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
a strong company even a company that has

93
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,439
good security themselves

94
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,840
if a partner that they have privilege

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,799
with

96
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,959
has their own vulnerability that becomes

97
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,720
a weak link into these businesses

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,799
networks too as you will see

99
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,480
the next attack i'm going to talk about

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
and these are kind of an order of

101
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,599
importance with the final being the most

102
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,480
important

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,799
is credential theft and identity attacks

104
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,160
we'll talk about how

105
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,399
attackers are really going after our

106
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,440
identity

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,959
because if they can pretend to be us

108
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,960
they can get past our defenses

109
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,680
and finally i will talk about ransomware

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,680
i'll talk about it very quickly because

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,199
if you're like me

112
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,639
we're kind of sick of hearing about

113
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,520
ransomware but unfortunately it is the

114
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,759
number one concern of north american

115
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,720
businesses

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
because it's the money maker it's how

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
attackers are successfully monetizing

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,160
these attacks

119
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,040
and ransomware has actually gotten maybe

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,520
uh

121
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,479
less mass sent to everyone but much more

122
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,960
targeted with much higher expense as

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,520
i'll show you in this presentation

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,160
so with that let's start with living off

125
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
the land attacks

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,199
if you haven't heard of living off the

127
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
land attacks it's essentially a form of

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,320
attack

129
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,039
that uses legitimate tools on your

130
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,720
computer or system

131
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,960
to help their attack rather than trying

132
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,120
to install new malicious programs that

133
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,880
your security might detect

134
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,759
they use legitimate actual processes

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
that windows or linux or macs come with

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
and they use those processes which with

137
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,039
the right credentials are very powerful

138
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,720
they can allow a bad guy to do bad

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
things without installing any malware

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,520
so living off the land attacks i'll show

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,360
you an example of one in a second that

142
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,960
will maybe give a better technical

143
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,160
description

144
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
but really these type of fileless

145
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
attacks have been growing

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,639
for the past few years you can see some

147
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,759
of the that they grew 256 percent the

148
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,000
first half of 2019 according to trend

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,080
micro one of our partners

150
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
why are files or living off the land

151
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
attacks uh so beneficial to

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,560
attackers again it's because a lot of

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
our traditional security controls

154
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
are looking for the traditional signs of

155
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,360
malware malicious files malicious

156
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,919
registry entries things on your hard

157
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,360
drive that malware

158
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
leaves that can be detected living off

159
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,440
the land attacks

160
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,880
instead use processes that belong to

161
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,600
windows

162
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
and it makes it much harder to detect

163
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
which is good for the attacker

164
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,919
we also have data from poneman research

165
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,600
that shows this by the way shows i

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,000
believe

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,400
2018 20 or i'm sorry 2017 2018 and 2019

168
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,880
that also showed these fileless attacks

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,840
are growing

170
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,440
41 as of 2019 in their 2020 uh

171
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,319
report other security companies like

172
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,319
semantics see the same thing

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,319
i'll talk about some of the legitimate

174
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,919
tools bad guys use but

175
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,000
powershell powershell is a very

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
legitimate windows program a powerful

177
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,880
program that a lot of administrators use

178
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
powershell is one of the ways they

179
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
launch these attacks and as you can see

180
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,120
big increases in the amount of malicious

181
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
powershell we see

182
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
by the way if you want to learn more

183
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,120
about living off the land attacks i

184
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,919
would check out

185
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,360
law baz law bas is a site that records

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,759
all the legitimate windows programs and

187
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,759
binaries the ones that

188
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,840
are part of your operating rating system

189
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,560
often but also are leveraged by bad guys

190
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
to do bad things

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,280
and as you can see windows has many dual

192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,680
use

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
tools tools that are great for

194
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
administrators but are also great for

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
bad guys with credentials

196
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,919
and by the way our own data shows that

197
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,000
these attacks are blowing up

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,400
recently my company watchguard security

199
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,319
acquired a spanish company called panda

200
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:36,960
security

201
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,000
fantastic endpoint uh protection

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,599
products and endpoint detection and

203
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,039
response products

204
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,039
and in their data between 2019 and 2020

205
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,560
we saw a 888 percent increase

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,120
in malicious scripts and these are the

207
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
scripts that kind of start

208
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,120
these living off the land attacks to

209
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
give you a quick example of one

210
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,160
i'll mention cassaya's attack briefly

211
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,800
later

212
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,120
but you might have heard of the cassaya

213
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,080
attack

214
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
this is an attack against a managed

215
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,280
service provider or

216
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,479
msp or actually 30 managed service

217
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,440
providers

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,280
that provide service to literally

219
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,919
thousands of businesses in north america

220
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
and and other countries as well and in

221
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,360
this attack

222
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
once they gain access to one of the msps

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,639
remote monitoring and managing systems

224
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,039
they use that to send this windows

225
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:29,759
command

226
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,360
which i'm going to quickly outline to

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,039
you even if you're not technical i'll

228
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,679
describe

229
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,799
what this long command did so first this

230
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,320
command starts with something very

231
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,799
simple

232
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,919
a ping a ping with a time frame

233
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,240
so this is a ping it's it's designed

234
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,800
basically to slow down the attack and

235
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,200
wait

236
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
to a specific time period it actually

237
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,160
was 1630 utc

238
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,519
which i think would be right around now

239
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,680
to start the rest of the attack and the

240
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,279
reason they do these delays

241
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,519
is some behavioral software might look

242
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,320
for something bad to happen right away

243
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,880
that ping did two things one it waited

244
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,680
for a while

245
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,600
and two it made sure when this attack

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,279
happened it affected

247
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,080
all the victims all at the same time the

248
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,920
second part is where they really start

249
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,399
living off the land they launch a power

250
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,279
shell command

251
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
again if you're a windows administrator

252
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
you know powershell is a very great

253
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
administrative tool

254
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
but if i have a user of system

255
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
credentials

256
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
which these attackers had due to a

257
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,120
cassette vulnerability

258
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,959
they could launch that command and the

259
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,480
first thing they do in that command is

260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,399
disable a lot of protections

261
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,959
they disable windows defender they

262
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
disable some of the ips that comes with

263
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,760
windows

264
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,680
and more now once they've done that

265
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
they start using other living off the

266
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,360
landing techniques

267
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,440
the first thing they did is they copy a

268
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,160
file called certutil.exe

269
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,440
to another place certutil is another one

270
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,680
of those legitimate binaries

271
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,920
it's used in windows to do certificate

272
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,279
things and to decode

273
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,519
certain things it's a very legitimate

274
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,839
file but there's two things attackers

275
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,040
like about it

276
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,279
one it can download a file from another

277
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,399
url

278
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,160
and two it can decode base64 an encoded

279
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,959
file

280
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,360
so if an attacker were able to upload

281
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,959
some sort of encoded

282
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,279
file that it contains military stuff

283
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,600
they could use cert util to download it

284
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,560
and to decode it into the real thing

285
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,839
the next thing they do is they're

286
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,000
actually moving cert util to a different

287
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
file in a different directory

288
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,839
and when they do that they don't want

289
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,640
windows to detect that a windows file is

290
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,800
somewhere it shouldn't be so they add a

291
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
little random information to it to

292
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,519
change

293
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,680
the file's profile or for technical

294
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,760
folks to change its hash

295
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,920
and this makes it harder for windows to

296
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,680
detect that a legitimate file has been

297
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
moved somewhere else

298
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,720
then they use that cert util which has

299
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,680
been renamed

300
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,399
to actually decode a malicious binary a

301
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,160
malicious blob that they had put

302
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,920
somewhere else on the network

303
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,040
and to actually turn it into an exe file

304
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,279
in a specific directory of the victim

305
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,480
computer

306
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,560
and then finally they delete some of

307
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,240
this this uh some of the

308
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,560
resident the residue of this stuff they

309
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,880
delete unnecessary files

310
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,880
and then they start running agent.exe

311
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,839
which was the actual malicious malware

312
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,560
now agent.exe by the way

313
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
wasn't just malware though it actually

314
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,240
was a legitimate but

315
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
old windows defender process so it was

316
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,200
the windows security executable

317
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,399
but a very old version it was one they

318
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,320
picked specifically because it suffered

319
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,880
from something called dll hijacking

320
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,839
the file also contained a dll of the

321
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,720
ransomware

322
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
that they were able to directly inject

323
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,920
into memory

324
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,519
so they didn't have to keep the file

325
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,279
they put the ransomware directly into

326
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,000
memory

327
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
a common thing in living off the land

328
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
attacks one note

329
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,760
is there are tools online that pen

330
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,440
testers and researchers use but

331
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,399
attackers use

332
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,440
too like cobalt strike and power sploit

333
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,120
often in these living off the land

334
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
attacks we see them

335
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,360
take code from these well-known tools

336
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,959
and use them to do this sort of

337
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,920
dll injection to get their malware to go

338
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,240
right

339
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,560
right into memory so that's just a quick

340
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,639
example of how living off the land

341
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,839
attacks work

342
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,360
and the key thing here the thing you

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,680
need to know is signature based malware

344
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,800
detection

345
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,320
probably wouldn't have caught any of

346
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,720
this you really need more advanced

347
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
solutions to actually catch the

348
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,560
malicious processes

349
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
and and the legitimate tools that are

350
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
injecting malicious processes somewhere

351
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,760
else

352
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,839
so the practical takeaway for this first

353
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,519
north american issue

354
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,240
is endpoint detection and response

355
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,040
products

356
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
on your endpoint you all are probably

357
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,440
aware of antivirus which we call

358
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,920
now call endpoint protection there's all

359
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,120
kinds of different

360
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,279
versions of it of course we make panda

361
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,160
securities adaptive defense 360.

362
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,720
but traditional av and even next

363
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,920
generation

364
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,959
av tries to present prevent as much as

365
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,600
it can

366
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
but it can sometimes miss things as well

367
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,959
that's why you need

368
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,680
edr solutions they don't just pay

369
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,000
attention to files and register entries

370
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,639
they pay attention to active processes

371
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,920
what they're doing

372
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,079
for instance that powershell command we

373
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,000
would notice powershell running on the

374
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800
system

375
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,399
we would pay attention to what

376
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,560
powershell is doing does this have signs

377
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
of maliciousness we would use our

378
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,920
contextual engine

379
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,680
rules and we would actually have

380
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,920
detected that file list malware that

381
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,760
living off the land attack

382
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
so key takeaway here i could go into a

383
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,240
lot of detail if i had time about edr

384
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,680
but i'm going to move on to the next

385
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,160
thing but know that don't just use

386
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,760
traditional av

387
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,320
add edr you know some stuff is going to

388
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,800
get past your preventative protection

389
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,279
edr is able to find malware on your

390
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,000
network

391
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
and often get rid of it and help you

392
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,800
remediate it before it even starts

393
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,639
so the next big issue affecting the

394
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,519
united states and north america canada

395
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,079
is credential and identity abuse and

396
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,600
this is a big one because if you think

397
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
about it

398
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,959
authentication and identity is one of

399
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,480
the most important parts

400
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,199
of security all our security controls

401
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,279
are based on knowing who we are because

402
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,720
we trust some people

403
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,480
but in order to trust them we have to

404
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,079
know who they are

405
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,920
and unfortunately there's lots of ways

406
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,639
today to steal or masquerade as someone

407
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,079
else's identity

408
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,920
the most common one is spearfishing i

409
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
think you've all heard of spearfishing

410
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
before so i'm not going to spend a lot

411
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,240
of time defining it

412
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,320
but let's go through a few statistics

413
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
first in north america

414
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,959
88 of organizations have experienced

415
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,760
spearfishing

416
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,880
at least in 2019 maybe even more now in

417
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,800
2020

418
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
i do want to report since we all still

419
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,240
are unfortunately going through the

420
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,399
pandemic in the delta virus

421
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,240
53 of ige reported increased fishing

422
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,800
that uses covid in some way whether it's

423
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,160
subsidies

424
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,480
trying to get you to the who or the cdc

425
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,760
but they use covid

426
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
as a lure to get your employees to click

427
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,519
on things

428
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,560
also bad guys love fishing because in

429
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,399
spear fishing because it's usually the

430
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,120
most easy way to break into any network

431
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,000
65 percent of attack groups initiate

432
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
their attacks with spear phishing

433
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
because if they can get a credential

434
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,680
they may not need more sophisticated

435
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
attacks or zero day

436
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,240
and finally a no before a a north

437
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,079
american organization that kind of

438
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,920
trains against phishing and helps

439
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,279
organizations with it

440
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,240
they find that almost 38 of untrained

441
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,279
employees

442
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,079
will fall for regular sp fishing which

443
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,320
means even more will probably fall for

444
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,360
spear fishing and by the way even though

445
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,440
i didn't define spear fishing i think

446
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,040
you guys know the difference between

447
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,680
fishing is fishing is a way to try to

448
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,440
lure you but it's automated

449
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,920
it's sent to everyone it's kind of

450
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
generic

451
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,440
meaning everyone gets kind of the same

452
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
message so it's

453
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
easier to catch spear fishing is much

454
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
more nefarious as it

455
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,519
very highly will target either you

456
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,720
individually

457
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,279
or a group in your organization and to

458
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,040
do that the attacker had to learn

459
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,839
something about you or your organization

460
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,079
this is one example of a spear phishing

461
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,920
email where you can see

462
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
this is an example of an email that

463
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,040
could come to me

464
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,320
perhaps i put a job requisition on my

465
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,720
site

466
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
asking for a new security researcher so

467
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,160
if you go to watch guard you see there's

468
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,519
a job opening

469
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,759
this is someone that says hey i know

470
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,519
you're a chief financial officer who

471
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,279
used to be rich barber so he knows

472
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,519
someone at her company he says

473
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,199
i have a great i also notice you have an

474
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,959
opening i have a great candidate that

475
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,560
has all the skills you need

476
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,360
here's a word document that has his cv

477
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,680
or

478
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,959
resume that looks like a very normal

479
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,519
email

480
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,600
if you've ever been hiring before you

481
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,199
could get emails like that very

482
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,240
legitimately

483
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
so it's an example of how just by

484
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
looking at a little information

485
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,520
on my site or or on on social media to

486
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,640
learn about me

487
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
they can do a very targeted email that

488
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,679
would be very

489
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,400
easy for me to open meanwhile that word

490
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,720
document could actually be a booby trap

491
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,359
or a

492
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,599
malicious document designed to send

493
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,480
malware

494
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,799
or to download malware so spearfishing

495
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,319
very big issue

496
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,919
the next big issue though is they don't

497
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,600
even need a spearfish anymore because

498
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,000
there are so many credential attacks

499
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,679
you've seen all the breaches to all

500
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
kinds of companies you know linkedin had

501
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,720
a breach

502
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
in the past facebook yahoo's had

503
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
breaches

504
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,720
fitness pal app there's so many

505
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,720
different companies that their website

506
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,360
has a breach and the bad guys are able

507
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,600
to download the database that drives the

508
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,480
website

509
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,039
and if they do that in many cases that

510
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,760
includes

511
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
hashed passwords for all the users that

512
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,360
log in

513
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,200
now if you have a really strong password

514
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,400
you might be safe

515
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,320
but if i'm a bad guy and i have hash

516
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,880
passwords i can crack all the passwords

517
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,559
up to 12 characters

518
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,799
so in all of these breaches that happen

519
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,600
to someone else they don't happen to you

520
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,039
bad guys have acquired you know billions

521
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,120
of credentials that you can find on the

522
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,160
underground

523
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,559
watchguard even has a service where we

524
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,160
actually have stored a lot of these

525
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,600
credentials and emails

526
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
so that we can tell you if you've had

527
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,440
any sort of breaches with your email

528
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,559
address

529
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,760
and as you know password reuse

530
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,799
a user so what if linkedin gets breached

531
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,480
right it's not your company

532
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
if one of your employees is on linkedin

533
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,480
their password gets stolen

534
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,080
and they happen to be one of the types

535
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
of people that use the same password

536
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,720
everywhere

537
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,039
that same password may be used to log

538
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,480
into your

539
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,919
network as well and this is why you know

540
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,960
it's often said by security experts that

541
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,080
hackers don't break

542
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,200
in they log in i don't need to figure

543
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,320
out any fancy

544
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,880
zero day or any fancy attack to break

545
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,160
into your system

546
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,640
if i can get a user credential if i can

547
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,080
get a user credential

548
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,480
i can go in right through the front door

549
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,799
that gives me enough privilege to start

550
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,480
laterally moving in your network and

551
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
doing other bad things

552
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,200
so between phishing and all of this

553
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,160
billions and billions of credential

554
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,720
theft bad guys are often kind of

555
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
targeting our authentication systems

556
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,679
first

557
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,840
they do things like password spraying

558
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
which is if they can find a login on the

559
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,720
internet

560
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,880
and they know one of your users names

561
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,559
they will just try the most common

562
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,440
passwords

563
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,280
there's a more targeted version of that

564
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,520
called credential stuffing

565
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
this is where they are not just trying

566
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,280
common passwords

567
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,039
you have an employee and they've

568
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,400
identified that email

569
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,559
has all these other leaked passwords

570
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,000
that email has used these

571
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
passwords in other places and they tried

572
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,559
those passwords against your site

573
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,120
there's also malware tools like mimikatz

574
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,799
and windows credential editor that if

575
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,320
they get on your computer

576
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
they start stealing all your local

577
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,559
passwords monitoring your network

578
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,039
for hashes or kerberos tickets so that

579
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,880
they can steal those authentication

580
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,559
tokens as well

581
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,960
sms trojans that if you're using otp

582
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,280
one-time passwords like two-factor

583
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
authentication

584
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
they try to get that second factor

585
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,840
through some sort of sms

586
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,720
trojan or sim swapping as well long

587
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
story short i can go into a ton of

588
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,039
detail on credential attacks but no

589
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,840
credentials are the first place an

590
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,960
attacker starts

591
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
if they can get one of your credentials

592
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,640
they don't have to burn any really

593
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,080
advanced attacks to get into your

594
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,120
network

595
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,799
so what's the takeaway for this what

596
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,000
should you do well multi-factor

597
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,159
authentication mfa multi-factor

598
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,320
authentication is the best way to defend

599
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,280
yourself

600
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,120
there are all kinds of other defenses

601
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,880
like i recommend you use a password

602
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,760
manager

603
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,520
to help you make really different and

604
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
really long passwords everywhere

605
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,000
but ultimately passwords may be lost or

606
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,960
stolen

607
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,039
multi-factor authentication is going to

608
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,679
combine passwords usernames with

609
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,679
biometrics digital tokens mobile tokens

610
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,320
even hardware tokens and by combining

611
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,039
more than one

612
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,400
authentication method even if a pass

613
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,720
attacker steals a password the

614
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,960
authentication and your proof of that

615
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,720
employee's digital identity is

616
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,960
much stronger and is much harder for the

617
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,760
bad guy to

618
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,840
fake and steal the next big issue that's

619
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,360
probably gotten a lot of attention at

620
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,080
the conference

621
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,320
between solar winds and cassaya attacks

622
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,440
is digital

623
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,240
supply chain attacks and i want to point

624
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,200
out here

625
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
when i say digital supply chain a lot of

626
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,880
times when we think about supply chain

627
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
we think about physical hardware

628
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,000
manufacturing you know device vendors

629
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,440
might buy parts from all kinds of

630
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,280
vendors put them in one thing

631
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,679
get software from someone else and then

632
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,320
that

633
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,640
that device that hardware goes through

634
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
other partners before it's sent to the

635
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,280
consumer

636
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,440
that's obviously a supply chain too and

637
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
by the way there's weaknesses security

638
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
weakness isn't that

639
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,880
but in this case i'm talking about every

640
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,360
business's digital supply chain

641
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,080
no matter what type of business you are

642
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,960
if you use

643
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,679
any technology you have a digital supply

644
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,159
chain

645
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,159
you have software from other people you

646
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,080
use you might have cloud

647
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,840
vendors and cloud partners that you've

648
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,000
partnered with and shared your data with

649
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,440
but now they're part of your digital

650
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,120
supply chain because their protection

651
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
matters to you

652
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,600
you may even have services i.t services

653
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
and technology services that you partner

654
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,320
with

655
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,200
but you give them extra privilege more

656
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
more access to your network

657
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
all of them become digital part of your

658
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
digital supply chain

659
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,200
and because of that their security

660
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,320
affects you

661
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,600
even if you have great security you now

662
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,440
are part of that digital supply chain

663
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,120
security as well

664
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,679
and because of this over the past four

665
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,120
or so years

666
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,600
we've seen many big digital supply chain

667
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,799
attacks

668
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,280
one of the first was not petcha not

669
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,760
pecha was actually probably

670
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,200
allegedly a russian state-sponsored

671
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,440
wiper malware attack targeting the

672
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,640
ukraine

673
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
the reason it's a digital supply chain

674
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,080
attack is the entity

675
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,600
allegedly russia broke into a ukrainian

676
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,559
accounting and tax software company

677
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,640
and so they gain access to this tax and

678
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
accounting software

679
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,480
and they used its update mechanism to

680
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,200
push this

681
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,320
pretend ransomware to all their victims

682
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,799
now not petcha looked like ransomware

683
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,679
but it wasn't

684
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,159
it deleted your data and destroyed it

685
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,000
the other issue with not petch is even

686
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,840
though it was a state-sponsored targeted

687
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,480
attack

688
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,120
likely going after ukrainian companies

689
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,520
it also had a worm in it which caused

690
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,080
the spread

691
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,240
far beyond just its target all over the

692
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,120
world too

693
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,520
but it all started with legitimate

694
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,760
legitimate accounting software

695
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,400
which got infected and via that digital

696
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,600
supply chain

697
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,440
the infection came through the update

698
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,880
mechanism

699
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,679
same with ccleaner i suspect many of you

700
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,480
windows

701
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,400
folks in the audience that use windows

702
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,159
probably have heard of ccleaner

703
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,320
it's a useful utility for windows that

704
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,159
can help clean your registry into other

705
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,120
things

706
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,240
unfortunately perform the company that

707
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,000
previously made ccleaner

708
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,559
had a network breach themselves these

709
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,559
actors were able to gain access to the

710
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,880
full source code of ccleaner

711
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,520
and create a signed update that was a

712
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,360
legitimate ccleaner update

713
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,000
but also contained a trojan in it that

714
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,039
got downloaded to about 2.2 million

715
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,480
victims and it then looked for certain

716
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,600
victims to install more malware on asus

717
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,440
bios updater was another thing

718
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,799
the company asus makes a lot of laptops

719
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,679
their supply chain got infected and the

720
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,840
bios update their mechanism the the

721
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,760
mechanism they used to upd

722
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
update the actual firmware on the

723
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,360
motherboard the bios

724
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,600
was infected so that it was used to

725
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,840
deliver malware to many asus computer

726
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,960
users

727
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,480
and of course the one i don't need to go

728
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,159
into much detail because i'm sure you've

729
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,760
heard a lot about it is the recent

730
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
solarwinds attack

731
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,520
solarwinds is a very popular i-team

732
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,919
monitoring and management tool

733
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,120
as you know they had a big big breach

734
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
that their source code got infected as

735
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,840
well and an update to solarwinds orion

736
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,960
affected many many companies the issue

737
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,039
with supply chain breaches

738
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,080
is the breach just gets exponential of

739
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,480
the

740
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,559
100 plus companies affected by the

741
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,159
solarwinds breach

742
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,039
many were big name security companies

743
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,080
that means even

744
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,559
customers of those security products

745
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,840
were put at risk too

746
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,159
because the attackers went after

747
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,480
microsoft palo alto

748
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,799
fireeye luckily a lot of those companies

749
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,559
were good at catching and containing the

750
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,200
breach

751
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,720
but the whole point with this supply

752
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,960
chain breach is it trickles down

753
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,120
to the company's customers and then the

754
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
customers after that if those other

755
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,279
companies get affected too

756
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,799
and finally the one i want to talk about

757
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,320
in a little more detail because it

758
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
really affects north america

759
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,520
is targeted managed service providers

760
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,159
uh there's been many different digital

761
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:16,960
supply

762
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,799
chain attacks against them which i'll

763
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,159
talk about in a moment

764
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,799
but before i do i want to make sure you

765
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,400
guys know how important

766
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,880
managed service providers are to north

767
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,919
america

768
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
managed service providers are basically

769
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,400
just organizations that if i'm a company

770
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,720
and i want to outsource it i want to

771
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,480
focus on my business and i don't really

772
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,440
want to build i.t

773
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
myself i can go to a managed service

774
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,880
provider

775
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,440
or a managed security service provider

776
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,240
and let them

777
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,120
take over my it and security functions

778
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,440
and

779
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,919
and do that for me it's very convenient

780
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,080
for small to medium businesses to do

781
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
this because then they don't have to

782
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
really invest a lot directly

783
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,840
and they can get these services to help

784
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,080
them in north america

785
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,120
at least 30 percent of smbs

786
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,480
use msps to provide their i.t service

787
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,240
and that's going up quickly some people

788
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
say it's 50 percent now

789
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,200
but latest kaspersky survey said that's

790
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
due to go up to 69

791
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,880
in the next 12 months so i hear that in

792
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,520
europe

793
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,399
msp use is a little less but in north

794
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:23,120
america

795
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,080
canada even latin america we're seeing

796
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,640
lots of

797
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,279
msp usage that means the small to medium

798
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,039
businesses outsources i.t

799
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,240
to someone else well starting the end of

800
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,039
2018 and throughout 2019

801
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,760
we started seeing ransomware authors

802
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,840
attack this supply chain

803
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,720
first our organizations like cesa who

804
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,760
manages

805
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,919
you know u.s cert indeed and has some

806
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,039
associated wish

807
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,159
dhs and the fbi

808
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,200
warned american businesses

809
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,679
that bad guys will be targeting managed

810
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,200
service providers

811
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,520
shortly after that a couple managed

812
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,279
service providers that use a remote

813
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,000
managing

814
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,640
and monitoring tool called connect wise

815
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,919
were attacked if they

816
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,320
used a cassette plug-in if you were

817
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,159
using a cassette plug-in in connect wise

818
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,080
it had a vulnerability

819
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,399
these ransomware attackers used it to

820
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,520
break into a lot of

821
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,080
msps and why is this a big deal because

822
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,640
remember each of those msps could have

823
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,200
tens

824
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,279
if not hundreds of small to medium

825
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,120
businesses that they serve

826
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,720
so if i infect one msp i could infect up

827
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,320
to 500

828
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,440
businesses that that msp takes care of

829
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,320
so that happened in february of 2019.

830
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,880
again

831
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,320
june of 2019 three msps were targeted

832
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,640
with

833
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,520
credential-based attacks somehow these

834
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,279
bad guys these ransomware authors were

835
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,200
able to get stolen credentials

836
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,919
they used them to log into the msp's own

837
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,159
management systems including a popular

838
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,760
endpoint security product

839
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,520
and they literally with that

840
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,039
authenticated credential

841
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,039
they used that management product to

842
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,960
push ransomware and malware to all the

843
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,159
endpoints

844
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,720
another example was the lone star state

845
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
in the us which is texas

846
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,600
there's some msps there that catered to

847
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,159
sheriff

848
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,039
offices and government municipalities

849
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,240
the ransomware

850
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,200
author targeted them to break into 22

851
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,919
different government and sheriff offices

852
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,279
then in august and december other msps

853
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,080
that dealt with

854
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,679
healthcare whether it would be

855
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,600
healthcare and or dental care

856
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,960
they broke into those msps used their

857
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,039
tools to install ransomware

858
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,159
on 400 plus dental offices so you see

859
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:38,960
this theme

860
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,640
the casino attack i'm about to talk

861
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,320
about is big news right now

862
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,799
but these supply chain attacks targeting

863
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,440
msps have been happening for a year

864
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,200
and the big culmination of this is of

865
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,440
course the cassaya attack that happened

866
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,840
just a few weeks ago i won't go in this

867
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,760
into a ton of detail as i'm sure you've

868
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,279
heard about it during this

869
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,799
boot camp but as you know in july 2nd

870
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,399
you know that living off the land

871
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,320
example i showed you was used to

872
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,039
synchronize

873
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,720
ransomware they broke into 30-plus msps

874
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,200
using

875
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,520
zero-day unfixed cassette

876
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,880
vulnerabilities

877
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,399
uh cassia didn't know about them but

878
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,240
they hadn't fixed them yet making them

879
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,600
still zero-day

880
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,799
and because of breaking into these

881
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,919
30 msps it affected you know

882
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,279
1500 to 2000 different organizations

883
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,080
so what should you do here adopt zero

884
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,039
trust

885
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,880
you know you one do some vendor analysis

886
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,000
and two make sure you strongly validate

887
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,840
the identity of the users and even

888
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,600
monitor them when they're inside your

889
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,480
network

890
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,399
to finish off very quickly i do want to

891
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,000
say the biggest concern

892
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,559
in north america right now is ransomware

893
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,159
i don't want to waste your time talking

894
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,159
about it in too much detail

895
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,960
because you know all about it i will say

896
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,399
ransomware has gone

897
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,320
from just being 300 extortion to

898
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,039
everybody to very sophisticated and

899
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,600
targeted attacks like these msp attacks

900
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,760
that affect tens of thousands of

901
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,120
computers sometimes

902
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,600
thousands of businesses at once and ask

903
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,000
for huge ransoms in the range of five to

904
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,600
forty million dollars

905
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,320
and they often steal your data so that

906
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,919
they still have your data even though

907
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,360
they've encrypted it and they threaten

908
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,279
to double extort you

909
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,679
for ransomware it continues to become a

910
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,640
problem

911
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,440
make sure you have a business continuity

912
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,600
and disaster recovery program

913
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,919
make sure you've tested it that is the

914
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,760
main tip you should have

915
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,000
make sure you've done that and of course

916
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
make sure you have backups

917
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,480
of your backups for final tips i've

918
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,919
given you a lot of tips throughout this

919
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:44,960
like mfa

920
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,720
edr using disaster recovery

921
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
the truth is there's no one silver

922
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
bullet that's going to solve all these

923
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,039
problems

924
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,480
you need to have all these layers

925
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,320
working together to protect you against

926
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,039
these attacks

927
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,039
i'm sure these north american attacks

928
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,480
are affecting the global

929
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
world as well but with that thank you
