2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
is

3
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,520
hello jay good afternoon welcome

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,680
how are you i'm well thank you so much

5
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
uh well go ahead and tell us please

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,038
what happened at solar winds

7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
well thank you so much for asking i

8
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,160
believe we have some slides that we can

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,800
show that

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,440
walk through some of the items here that

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,479
may help

12
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,960
but um i'm going to be happy to go

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
through those

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,479
i'll start with some of the key

15
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,720
takeaways that we've learned as part of

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,560
our solarwinds and other

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,320
adversarial response specifically with

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,400
regard to this campaign

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
we are dealing with a patient and

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
resourceful adversary

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
they understand where we are weak

22
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,479
um and i want to be clear about where we

23
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,840
all are weak together um

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,040
first our architectures

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
are overtly trusting second

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
at least in the u.s federal government

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,040
and broadly

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,560
across the community we are seeing

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159
that cloud identity

30
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,119
is not where it needs to be yet and

31
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,799
there will be a number of years before

32
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,000
we get there

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
finally the amount of coordination uh

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,560
isn't there

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
uh second our adversaries understand

36
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,520
how our work posture has changed and how

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,239
to best

38
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,599
exploit it 15 years ago

39
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,640
and in many ways until a year ago most

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,000
of our connections

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,560
were from a work style workstation

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
inside the network

43
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
to a resource inside the same network

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,360
boy things have changed with covid

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
with millions and millions of people

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
now working from home this adversary

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
has exploited that change in work

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,040
posture

49
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,160
in a way that really cuts to the core

50
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,680
of how we secure systems

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
next the recon for this effort

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
would have started in 2019 if not

53
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
earlier uh in

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,159
the first known foothold uh back a slide

55
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,280
uh was was was was earlier

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,879
um and and so if we think that the first

57
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,360
known uh solarwind networks compromise

58
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,040
was in september 2019

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,000
when did they start looking at this um

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,720
second

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,040
the adversary's exploited weakness says

62
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,000
in both our supply

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,959
chain and our identity management this

64
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:21,680
campaign

65
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,560
had solarwinds involvement but really

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,280
non-supply

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,560
chain methods were used uh including

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,120
password spraying for example which

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,319
could be

70
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,400
really easily stopped with multi-factor

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,159
authentication

72
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,799
uh second note uh solarwinds was not

73
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:39,519
installed

74
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,200
at over 30 percent of the impacted

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,959
entities from this campaign so the the

76
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,640
campaign was broader

77
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
and in many instances we're still not

78
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,480
sure

79
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,599
what that initial uh initial intrusion

80
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,799
vector was

81
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,200
last note on this and this on this page

82
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
is that the

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,480
uh adversary actions towards their

84
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,319
ultimate goals are

85
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,959
very difficult for many organizations to

86
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,080
identify

87
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,200
and that's because the adversary used

88
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,080
[Music]

89
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,519
they used known good logins to

90
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,238
shield their traffic and to be remain

91
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,759
stealthy

92
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,798
and so we need to as a community have

93
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,720
better cloud telemetry

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
understand that even though a successful

95
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,600
a login may be successful

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,160
it may not be appropriate and that we

97
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,280
need to deploy

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
behavior analytics widely across our

99
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,800
infrastructure

100
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,759
final little note on this page is you

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,080
know when you're doing incident response

102
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,919
and the adversary is looking at your

103
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,360
every move that

104
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,800
complicates uh your your program and

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
complicates the work you must do as an

106
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
instant responder

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
so making sure that you have out of

108
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
bands communications

109
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
such as simple as signal or as post-it

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,880
notes

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
uh are really helpful now i'd like to go

112
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,320
to the next

113
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,120
slide and walk you through uh some of

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,080
the the

115
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,800
the timeline here and i really think

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,479
it's important for everybody to

117
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,280
understand

118
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
just how long this went um

119
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,919
so at no time uh

120
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,320
was this adversary detected on

121
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,400
solarwinds network

122
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,120
it wasn't until the fireeye report at

123
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,479
the very end

124
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
that somebody noticed so let's just

125
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,759
quickly walk through

126
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,400
what happened here and when so we saw

127
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,759
back in september

128
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,880
2019 the threat actor

129
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
initially accessed the solarwinds

130
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
network and injected

131
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,120
code into the build process for the

132
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
solarwinds product

133
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,080
they then waited patiently

134
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,880
until they could see it deployed out

135
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,520
into

136
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,240
target networks so we assume that that

137
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,199
happened

138
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,400
uh after the 11-4

139
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,639
2019 date uh back in

140
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,560
then you go forward till february

141
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,520
2020 and that's when the sun burst code

142
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,000
was

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,880
compiled and then deployed into

144
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,479
solarwinds product

145
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,639
the hotfix was then made available to

146
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,280
customers five weeks later

147
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,479
and then in that period of time that

148
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,039
lasts

149
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,319
from the end of june to the sorry the

150
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,360
end of march to the beginning of june

151
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,840
we saw thousands and thousands of

152
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,479
targets

153
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,479
that were impacted by this code this

154
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,319
malicious code

155
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,600
now um if you see

156
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,360
there was no detection from anybody who

157
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,160
had this this

158
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,440
activity until solarwinds was notified

159
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
of sunburst

160
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,960
by um fireeyes part of their compromise

161
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,360
i'd like to highlight to everybody here

162
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,120
how that happened

163
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
uh a help desk technician at

164
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,000
fireeye got a saw an error

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,639
where a user was trying to add a new

166
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,360
form of multi-factor authentication

167
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,599
so just the most basic basic of problems

168
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,319
which is an

169
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,759
mfa ad was noticed by help desk tech

170
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,199
and flagged for his management now

171
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,680
you know we as an industry spend

172
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,599
billions of dollars a year

173
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
on complex and useful powerful tools

174
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,720
but sometimes it's important to remember

175
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,880
having a well-trained help desk

176
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
incident response procedure and

177
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,639
multi-factor authentication

178
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,240
can really make your life a lot better

179
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,840
um the rest of this activity

180
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,960
happened in the news where we had daily

181
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
updates

182
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,199
from my team at sizza from the

183
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,319
team over at solarwinds and a variety of

184
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,280
both public and private sector partners

185
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,560
um you know this continued the

186
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,360
investigation

187
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,560
it says ongoing it is ongoing

188
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,840
we will probably be years before we have

189
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,240
full

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,319
ground truth as to everything that

191
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,560
happened as part of this campaign

192
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,440
suffice to say though we've definitely

193
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
learned some lessons

194
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,919
we have the next slide please

195
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,560
so first uh identity is everything

196
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,719
um with cloud hosted infrastructure

197
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,839
uh and remote work driving this forward

198
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
um identity is our new perimeter

199
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,159
and while the the the term is a little

200
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,120
loud

201
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,519
i i it's almost ready to say the

202
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,680
firewall is dead

203
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,200
covid has accelerated this this this

204
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,760
trend

205
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,519
immensely and i we are as we talk to

206
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,760
people who provide i.t services both

207
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,120
within the government

208
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,480
and the united states critical

209
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
infrastructure

210
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,240
we're asking them if they're ready for

211
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
this um

212
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,279
trust store and identity management

213
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,760
compromises

214
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,560
are excellent targets for adversaries

215
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,040
and they

216
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,959
are exploiting them um the basics of

217
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
cyber hygiene are a must you must deploy

218
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
your tools according to best practices

219
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,760
such as active directory you must

220
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
implement the privilege of least

221
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,279
principle across all of your user

222
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,000
account

223
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
and you must patch quickly um

224
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,959
those are the basics those are always

225
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,040
have been will continue to be those help

226
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,640
protect you against ransomware

227
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
this help protect you against nation

228
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,399
states but

229
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,000
as we move forward if you want to

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
protect your infrastructure

231
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,480
from more sophisticated threats it's

232
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,360
essential

233
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,680
that you run tools such as bloodhound

234
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
and you understand

235
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,360
how the identity infrastructure is set

236
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,600
up and that you threat model through it

237
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
um threat model threat actors are going

238
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
to model your trust relationships

239
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,440
they're going to get on your wire

240
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,760
and they're going to map out how your

241
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,079
infrastructure is configured

242
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,920
you need to do the same um

243
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
there are some other things that can

244
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,839
help you on that front and that's making

245
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,720
sure that you have additional

246
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,519
authentication

247
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,760
methods to both user and service

248
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,279
accounts to make sure

249
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,320
logins remain valid um

250
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
i i would say multi-factor

251
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,839
authentication

252
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,279
needs to be enabled on every account

253
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,440
we frequently get questions here at

254
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,399
sizza

255
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,440
what do you mean by every account

256
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,640
and we mean every single account user

257
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
and service account

258
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,200
we need to make sure that we understand

259
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
that those are true of uh true

260
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,480
authentication attempts

261
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,360
and that we have that extra uh security

262
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,000
that's provided by that multi-factor

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
uh finally and we saw this as part

264
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
specifically the solarwinds compromise

265
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,880
um for entities that are

266
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,440
merging together or considering adding a

267
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,959
new business unit

268
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,240
adding a whole domain uh third-party

269
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,519
trust for transparent

270
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,000
pass-through authentication is is not an

271
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
okay practice anymore that's an

272
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,200
extremely risky behavior

273
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,560
uh it's a little in the weeds but i

274
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,839
wanted to make sure that everybody here

275
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,279
who has an identity

276
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,440
expert understands that as you merge two

277
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,880
organizations together

278
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,399
how you handle that identity work is key

279
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,279
um final note here is about behavior

280
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
analysis techniques

281
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,320
um they are required now to identify an

282
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,640
identity compromise

283
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,959
it requires both business intelligence

284
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,720
and analytics that a lot of businesses

285
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,920
don't have

286
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,200
uh detecting it can be challenging

287
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,560
um but we need to understand

288
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,800
why different accounts are acting in

289
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
certain ways on large networks

290
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,240
um and just another on the

291
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,600
next page i'm going to talk about this a

292
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,120
little bit more in terms of detection

293
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,560
opportunities can we go there please

294
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
great i want to first be clear on this

295
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,519
first bullet point

296
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,440
detecting a supply chain compromise of

297
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,920
this nature is beyond most organizations

298
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,440
capabilities

299
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
threat actors are extremely

300
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,560
sophisticated and

301
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,880
smart and they look across the

302
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
constellation of products and

303
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
attack us in ways that we are at least

304
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
capable of responding

305
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,800
so what do we have to do

306
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,399
to make sure that a supply chain

307
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,120
compromise

308
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,680
is of least impact to us or we

309
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
understand when an adversary gets in the

310
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,040
wire

311
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
first let's talk about network

312
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,480
baselining and be

313
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,680
abnormal behavior analytics

314
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,839
one of the things that you should or

315
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,040
that i should see

316
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
i live in washington dc and

317
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,720
my organization should see that i am

318
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,440
logged in

319
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,720
from washington dc however

320
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,279
if i were to be logging in at the same

321
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,160
time

322
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,480
from madrid that should flag an alert

323
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,760
in terms of user behavior that is

324
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,480
abnormal

325
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,440
and it should be looked at we need to do

326
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,320
that across

327
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,680
all of our users and all of our accounts

328
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,360
understanding when user behavior

329
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
is abnormal is one of the only ways to

330
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,920
understand

331
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,000
when improper activity isn't occurring

332
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,360
in cloud-hosted infrastructures so

333
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,120
that was the first example of an

334
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,480
impossible login

335
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
how can i concurrently be in both

336
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,480
madrid and washington dc at the same

337
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,440
time

338
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
there are some other ones in terms of

339
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,839
impossible logins it's

340
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,279
length of time why would i be asking for

341
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,800
a saml ticket that goes for

342
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,600
two days instead of an hour

343
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,880
all of these types of information are

344
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
included in our activity alert which

345
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,800
i've highlighted below

346
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,240
on detecting post compromise activity in

347
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
microsoft cloud

348
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,519
the the other item here is i want to

349
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,880
share with you is

350
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,199
ciso was very proud of the fact that we

351
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:24,720
created some tooling

352
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,839
to help network defenders hunt

353
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,000
their cloud infrastructures it's called

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
the sparrow tool

355
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,959
and it's it's it's included

356
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,399
on that github page so um next

357
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,120
slide because we're moving forward in

358
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,839
time

359
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,680
these are some key questions that

360
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,720
both business

361
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,639
owners so the people who own the

362
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,720
business side of an infrastructure

363
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,000
and the it staff need to work together

364
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,720
on

365
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,959
these are questions that if you're a

366
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,240
head chief risk

367
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,600
officer or chief operating officer

368
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,399
these are types of questions that should

369
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:06,720
be

370
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,360
asked of your network staff do you know

371
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,959
who you trust

372
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,880
seems pretty simple but when we talk to

373
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,360
both federal agencies and we've talked

374
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,560
to

375
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,680
many large businesses understanding

376
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
who they have configured trust

377
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,800
relationships with

378
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,360
and how they've done that has often been

379
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,720
a bit of a mystery

380
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,639
because the person who does that work is

381
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,160
a network admin

382
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,720
but the person who's accepting that risk

383
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
is the senior level

384
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,440
of that com firm company or organization

385
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,360
uh when did you last validate that trust

386
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,440
it's a little tricky to validate it but

387
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,120
that is something you should do um

388
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
do you have visibility into your cloud

389
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
hosted cloud environments

390
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,199
can you see all authentication attempts

391
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,519
rather amazingly we found that many

392
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,839
many many companies and critical

393
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,440
infrastructure partners

394
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,160
uh just connected to the cloud but never

395
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,680
configured logging in a way that was

396
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,560
going to be

397
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
useful to understand what was actually

398
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,880
happening in their infrastructure

399
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,959
can you see all authentication attempts

400
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,759
is something you normally can do

401
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,560
in your on-prem environment it isn't the

402
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
case

403
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
in many cloud environments and it adds a

404
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,800
different

405
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,360
set of complexity uh the last two items

406
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,079
i want to

407
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,079
highlight quickly first if your main

408
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,519
network was compromised

409
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,800
can you still operate uh that's

410
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,000
really hard to do we we've seen entities

411
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,720
try and do it they end up on signal and

412
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,040
in

413
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,880
using typewriters and setting up google

414
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,160
uh gmail accounts that trying to cobble

415
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
together an infrastructure

416
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,800
in the middle of a cyber incident is

417
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,079
really challenging

418
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,680
i encourage everybody to do a little

419
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,480
planning on that ahead of time

420
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,880
and then finally when did you last

421
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,639
exercise your dr plan

422
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,040
this is actually a really helpful

423
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,000
activity to engage

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,039
in doing that disaster recovery uh

425
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,599
plan because it has so many other

426
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,559
benefits

427
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,799
not only when dealing with significant

428
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,599
nation state

429
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,760
uh threat actors but also with dealing

430
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,119
something as

431
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,640
unfortunately as common as ransomware

432
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,160
um we just responded to a gigantic

433
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,599
ransomware incident

434
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,000
and many many many companies came back

435
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
to us and said

436
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,480
oh our you know all of our

437
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,559
infrastructure was encrypted but we were

438
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,200
fine

439
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,679
because we had backups and we just did a

440
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,039
restoration

441
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,360
um i would i would encourage everybody

442
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,240
here

443
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,120
who who does uh who is responsible for

444
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
an infrastructure to go out there and do

445
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
that make sure you exercise your your

446
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,760
backup plan your disaster recovery

447
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,480
with that i think my slides are over and

448
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,000
i think i'm responsible for answering

449
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,039
some questions

450
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,400
thank you jay we have two questions

451
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,679
from our audience and the first one is

452
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,200
how is the coordination between cisa

453
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,320
and fbi and other entities for the

454
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,679
management of these

455
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,880
incidents what role does each entity

456
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
assume

457
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,120
great question um there is a lot of

458
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,000
coordination

459
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,520
between our agency and the

460
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,240
fbi and other entities within the us

461
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,200
government

462
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,799
we spun up uh many something called a

463
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,880
ucg where we all get together and work

464
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,480
on a daily basis

465
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,840
um but the governmental roles

466
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,960
are sizza is responsible for the asset

467
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,080
response

468
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,320
we at the us government and within

469
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,600
critical infrastructure

470
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,640
are there to help asset owners recover

471
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,160
restore and protect their

472
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,720
infrastructures fbi is responsible for

473
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,000
the threat work

474
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
identification of you know who the bad

475
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,039
guys are

476
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,919
and and responding to it that's not my

477
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,880
role

478
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,520
um but i'm glad we have the fbi there to

479
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,240
do that

480
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,160
sizza with the way that we kind of break

481
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,679
down those rules and try and explain it

482
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,480
to people

483
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,160
is sizza considers itself the

484
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,679
firefighter all

485
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,679
fbi is the police yeah the next

486
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,039
question is you spoke on the importance

487
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,720
of the human resource

488
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,640
do you think that the basic cyber

489
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
security education

490
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,919
should be mandatory for new and existing

491
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:34,720
employees

492
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,840
in any organization

493
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,760
um it's really hard for me to speak

494
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
to what the right level of training is

495
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
for an organization

496
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
i grew up in a small town outside of

497
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,640
detroit

498
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,600
where many people worked in factories i

499
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,640
would not say

500
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
to somebody who's working on the

501
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,400
assembly line or machinist

502
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
that maybe a cyber security is a key

503
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,600
part

504
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,159
however if you have an administrative

505
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,520
account on a on a

506
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,000
on a machine you should have a deep

507
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,960
knowledge

508
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,679
of cyber security and that i would say

509
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,960
in that case it's

510
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,120
very worthwhile spending quite a bit of

511
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,000
time

512
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
uh understanding the practice and

513
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
domains involved

514
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,960
and finally how can we deal with

515
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,159
organizations

516
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,720
particularly critical infrastructures

517
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,400
that accumulate a large

518
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,039
technological depth and how can we

519
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,480
secure those environments

520
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,000
well um technology debt is my favorite

521
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,480
topic

522
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,320

523
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,480
question about

524
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,600
um technical debt is the the problem of

525
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,559
our time

526
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,640
we're going to spend the next five to

527
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,000
ten years

528
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,799
working with uh infrastructures to

529
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,440
either

530
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,200
renew that infrastructure or

531
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,320
protect it by network isolation the the

532
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,400
thing that we can all do as information

533
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,640
technology professionals today

534
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,760
is help our boards and help our

535
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,720
senior leadership begin to understand

the cost

537
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,120
of technical debt and as we bring in new

538
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,159
projects

539
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,880

540
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,440
