1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
hello everybody you are the few people

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:09,269
who are not on CSS it seems because if I

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,639
look up here everything is very empty so

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,990
thank you for coming here and not doing

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:19,259
your siesta I would like to do a quick

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:24,480
test those who can understand me please

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,420
raise your hand good good I once was in

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,189
Vietnam and at a conference and did a

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,590
speech and I asked this question

10
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,690
somewhere in the middle and two people

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,690
out of I don't know 200 raised their

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:45,930
arms so I'm thankful you and you're able

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:48,718
to understand me so um why am I here my

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,079
guess is I'm here because I'm very old I

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,890
don't look it okay still fresh skin and

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,469
everything but I'm overall about 20

17
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:04,650
years in the hacker seen 20 years is a

18
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:06,290
long time which not only impairs my my

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,650
eyes and I can't see that well anymore

20
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:13,770
but i think the organizers hope that I

21
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:17,090
have visions visions of the future some

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,770
things you might which might help you um

23
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:27,479
which he hopes i might communicate to

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:31,560
you i got one hour for this keynote to

25
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:35,780
talk to you that's something which

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:41,939
doesn't work a keynote is there to

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:46,439
inspire tell you a vision maybe call you

28
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:49,048
to action but if this takes longer in 20

29
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,600
minutes then you talk an idea to that to

30
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:58,469
death and then it's gone so I'm a hacker

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,780
what do hackers do they make their own

32
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,270
rules they change the rules and change

33
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,939
the game and that's what what I will be

34
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,489
doing so what we will do here is

35
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:13,170
something like not the presentation you

36
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,890
have ever seen I will do is short

37
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,309
introduction

38
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,350
and then we already go for the questions

39
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,360
so we start with questions you might

40
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,870
have for me and that will be the only

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,209
time during what I will do where you'll

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,980
be able to ask me any question you want

43
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:39,630
to do be with me this actually might

44
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:42,390
have a concept so Who am I oh who knows

45
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,760
my name or has heard my name before or

46
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:50,100
used my tools are you knows the hackers

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,679
choice hands up okay this is maybe

48
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,920
twenty percent okay short introduction

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,890
my name is Marc Marc weiszer or the heck

50
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,030
up pseudonym van Hauser been around for

51
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:06,540
20 years the author of several tools

52
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:10,170
like Hydra for network login hacking a

53
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,209
map for application fingerprinting Road

54
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,700
war dialers did a lot of security

55
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,840
research on ipv6 so the next internet

56
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:21,030
protocol yeah you might say okay this is

57
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,860
a hacker and he is the founder of one of

58
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,060
the oldest hacker groups out there while

59
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,920
he's on stage and not in jail now valid

60
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,870
question the first thing is I don't do

61
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,940
anything illegal in our hacker group we

62
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,510
don't do anything illegal we are more

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,100
for that say alternative research for us

64
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,000
it's important to find vulnerabilities

65
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,160
and systems in software encode doesn't

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,019
matter we publish it we publish tools

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,040
which help to attack and show their

68
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:52,980
issues and that's all we do so sharing

69
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,769
information of course our tools and our

70
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:00,768
what we teach is being misused by the

71
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:03,870
bad guys bad guys like CIA bad guys like

72
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:07,260
Spanish Secret Service which I also know

73
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,180
you use our tools well so the bad guys

74
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,429
are doing using them but also the good

75
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,500
guys and that's what's important now the

76
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,220
good guys like administrators checking

77
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,238
that their systems are secure Oh

78
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,500
penetration testers to check for the

79
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,130
clients that things are secure and

80
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,090
hopefully nobody can hack in now so this

81
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,090
is basically what we do

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:35,800
and that's why I hope I'm here so the

83
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:39,039
talk title is how to become a successful

84
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:43,240
hacker and this is really what i want to

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,820
show you in the next 20 minutes this is

86
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,640
what my experience had teach me and i do

87
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,070
lots of workshops lots of trainings for

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,310
people who are security clueless to

89
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:56,140
those who really eager and already know

90
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:00,760
a lot of stuff so security training

91
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:02,950
security experts and there are certain

92
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,810
characteristics which are important if

93
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,979
you want to be successful and that's

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,950
something I want to show you and teach

95
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:14,890
you before I do that we come to the

96
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,810
question part because as I said that's

97
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:21,909
the only part where you will be able to

98
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:23,680
ask questions now is the time because I

99
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,030
figure it out at some point you might

100
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,400
ask questions and if I leave that out

101
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,830
completely might also be bad so if you

102
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:33,820
have any kind of questions for me ask

103
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:36,400
them now might be non that's okay too if

104
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,620
someone has a question please raise your

105
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,750
hand we have a microphone microphone

106
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,250
please over there please thank you for a

107
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,010
question well I haven't heard it but

108
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:50,010
let's say I'm positive thank you

109
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,560
hello a left side but your why you are

110
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,770
here but my question is what is your

111
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,449
motivation for to be here my motivation

112
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,930
to be here Oh interesting question

113
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:15,349
actually is too many fold let's put like

114
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:20,689
that the organizers here also did

115
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:24,349
another event the the forgotten and the

116
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:26,569
party events there was one last year in

117
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:28,610
Berlin where they invited me for a

118
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:32,750
speech so that were there was already

119
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:35,180
the contact I like Madrid I like Spain

120
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,550
not for the food a vegetarian which is

121
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,099
horrid pain is a horrible place to be as

122
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:43,340
a vegetarian but I like the culture that

123
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:45,080
you go to for dinner very late um the

124
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:48,049
food is usually good if it's vegetarian

125
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,359
now the climate is great people talk a

126
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,430
lot where I come from people are more

127
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,080
for themselves so interacting with

128
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,949
others it's like I don't know this

129
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,770
person let's go here now so so the

130
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:04,069
lifestyle is I like it and what I

131
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:08,479
especially like for this event is that's

132
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:11,960
for I would say interested interested

133
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,139
people may be clueless but interested so

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,089
people you can still form and motivate

135
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:22,159
and maybe get to a right direction but

136
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:24,889
that's why I'm here thank you another

137
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:26,539
question over there in the blue shirt

138
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:32,449
and then we have another one in the grey

139
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:34,960
shirt over there hi I have a question

140
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:37,879
that whenever you conduct any seminar

141
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,430
just like this one that how can you

142
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,229
become a successful hacker so there are

143
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,689
so many people attending the same

144
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,878
seminar so what are the factors that can

145
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:49,460
decide that one can overwhelm the

146
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,129
ability of the other one because you are

147
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:55,188
delivering the same thing to everyone ok

148
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:57,469
um when I do trainings it's not this

149
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:59,539
when I do training it's like how to do

150
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:02,000
penetrant penetration testing on ipv6

151
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,520
it's like how to do basic reverse

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,949
engineering it's about how to do perform

153
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,448
internet penetration testing how to do

154
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,849
secure coding that's what I usually

155
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,210
teach now here for the keynote it's

156
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:15,110
something

157
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,630
very different this is not a seminar

158
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,000
workshop this is a keynote presentation

159
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,789
which should motivate you to show you

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,729
okay this is something I could do and it

161
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:27,949
will be on the net strictly the same for

162
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:29,539
everyone of course because you everyone

163
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,209
here here's the same and see it's the

164
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:41,360
same but what they make out of it that's

165
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:46,939
the difference hello thank you very much

166
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,500
for me here i'm going to are a very very

167
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,029
good programmer but i would develop her

168
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:55,100
how do you know when to jump from being

169
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:57,350
a simple developer tooling hacker or

170
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,959
something about the skills something

171
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,899
about passion now for me it was always

172
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,300
the opposite i was a hacker at at some

173
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,040
point if you're not a script kiddie it's

174
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,380
something like you are here and you want

175
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,779
to achieve that but you don't have you

176
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:14,089
can't find the software to get there now

177
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,070
then you then you realize okay i have to

178
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,770
do that myself how do i do that

179
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,420
 i have to learn programming now and

180
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,600
then you have to start okay so how do i

181
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,010
program and i'm self teach programmer

182
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,690
wow I'm not the best programmer if you

183
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,829
look at my code you will agree it's not

184
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:35,470
the best code now but I'm a hacker not a

185
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:37,579
developer so sorry for that ok so but

186
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,820
somebody told you you were a hacker or

187
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:45,260
do considered hacker by shirt hacker is

188
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:47,600
a very white definition yeah a hacker

189
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,540
can be someone who breaks into systems

190
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,880
and steals data yeah it can be someone

191
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,219
who who writes a sampler on a very

192
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,880
esoteric machine that just to make

193
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:03,050
things work hacker is a very open open

194
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:07,459
definition for me hacker is trying to

195
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:09,319
understand something which is abstruse

196
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:11,029
oh you can't you don't really know what

197
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,190
it is you try to understand it and then

198
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:17,089
make something new with that that is for

199
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:19,010
me what hacking is so when Joanna said

200
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,860
yeah everybody who does it a little bit

201
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:23,209
of Python coating calls himself a hacker

202
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,649
true and it's also something i

203
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:27,018
understand but because

204
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,939
if you make something new now you

205
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:30,529
already want to use something in

206
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:36,740
different ways and expected you're

207
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:40,279
already a hacker Thanks so any more

208
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,709
questions okay more people coming back

209
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:47,230
for their lunch and siesta wonderful if

210
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:52,059
there are no more questions let's start

211
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,059
how to become a successful hacker the

212
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:59,230
problem you might call it a problem but

213
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:06,050
you might also call it an opportunity i

214
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:09,920
T is changing every year in some areas

215
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:12,019
fast in some areas slow if you look for

216
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,540
example Windows operating systems moving

217
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:17,149
very slowly now then you have new

218
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,589
developments like cloud Wow there is or

219
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,389
virtualization Wow everybody wants

220
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,860
relation now it's just been there

221
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:26,769
yesterday so you have parts which grow

222
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:31,249
slowly and others which grow very fast

223
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:33,819
now but overall if at some point you

224
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:36,670
learned about security or hacking and

225
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:40,579
let's say you go on a 10 year vacation

226
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:43,399
you come back things have changed

227
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:48,498
dramatically so in other areas where you

228
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:51,110
can just be a mechanic and well cars

229
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:55,279
developed to of course but much slower

230
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:57,439
it's not a big problem in IT if you

231
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,920
don't adapt to the change you are

232
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:03,740
outdated and with hacking and security

233
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,040
it's even worse for most people i t they

234
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:10,549
operate things we in security and

235
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,610
hacking so if offensive defensive we

236
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:15,589
have to understand it which is much more

237
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:21,670
difficult to understand something just

238
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:25,579
to click something so where I come from

239
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,889
20 years ago no internet maybe there was

240
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,138
already internet but no way to reach the

241
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:32,629
internet for me I was still young so

242
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:34,759
back then we had mailboxes where we

243
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:37,339
dialed in with modems from our computers

244
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,209
now if you wanted to learn something

245
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,189
there were texts

246
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:46,819
miles which were usually outdated and

247
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:49,490
wrong or both there were already people

248
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:51,139
grouping together because someone got a

249
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,119
bit of information another person get a

250
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:56,779
bit of information and combining that

251
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:58,699
wow that really made sense now so people

252
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:02,420
were trying to group together why our

253
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:04,758
mailboxes but also vm B's voicemail box

254
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,769
systems which you could easily hack with

255
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:08,660
pins you would have a group code then

256
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,089
and then you could talk to each other as

257
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,399
Y or the vm bees for example and you

258
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:16,160
would have local meetings like let's

259
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,679
meet in frankfurt london paris where

260
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,420
ever meet up and talk about stuff and

261
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:27,259
get connected ah so very very basic

262
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:29,269
there later when we got internet we had

263
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:31,339
mailing lists like when backtrack was

264
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:33,290
created now to exchange information

265
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:36,800
about vulnerabilities made them much

266
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:39,248
easier we had electronic magazines like

267
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,219
frak now we still have frak today but

268
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:46,839
not with the same status and the same

269
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,240
information like it had 10 years ago

270
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,889
there were more and more groups and

271
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,230
there were more national meetings so

272
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:56,990
people actually travel somewhere now

273
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,959
like the CCC Congress in Germany there

274
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,179
or Def Con in the US now where people

275
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,799
travel to mingle and in exchange for

276
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:10,249
mation because now there were more

277
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:12,230
people in today's times if you want to

278
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:15,319
get to know something about security or

279
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:18,319
hacking it's everywhere you can buy a

280
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:20,509
book you can read a blog you can

281
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:22,279
download virtual machines which have

282
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:24,439
lots of vulnerability enabled to teach

283
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,299
you how to hack something you can come

284
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:28,849
to this conference can you imagine this

285
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:32,329
kind of conference being in existence 10

286
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:34,009
years ago no there was no space for that

287
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,910
yes there was no opportunity for this

288
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:40,100
that it would be even nearly successful

289
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:42,110
today you can you can go to the

290
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,910
University study computer science and

291
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,470
there will be an ethical hacking class

292
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,629
or something like that where you learn

293
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,310
to how to write buffer overflow exploits

294
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:52,160
for example

295
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:56,060
you can go to a security conference pay

296
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,600
for trainings at today learning about

297
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:03,349
security in hacking is absolutely easy

298
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,990
if you want to learn it so when you look

299
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,600
back 20 years why I started it was very

300
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:13,160
hard to find information and that

301
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:15,800
information was actually correct that

302
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,089
was really lucky if that was the case

303
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,829
and today you might say you have it easy

304
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,140
much easier than we did in our younger

305
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,940
days yeah you know I'm so old now

306
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,949
actually in my opinion it's harder for

307
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:33,500
you there is much more information

308
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,810
available now then in the older years

309
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,650
much much more like books training

310
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:42,709
classes etc at this conference also the

311
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:45,380
number of people is increasing because

312
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,570
it's so much easier to get a foothold in

313
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,089
the field and start learning like class

314
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,860
and university now Oh buying a book in

315
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,500
the next book store now oh it's about

316
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,990
hacking cool huh and learn about stuff

317
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,730
downloading virtual machine now so easy

318
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,400
it's easier for people drag in there

319
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:03,230
also companies need more security people

320
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,520
so they hire people and train them if

321
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,880
they don't have already the knowledge

322
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,010
now I think there are some companies

323
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,660
here like don't know Deloitte extension

324
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,910
something where they hire people and

325
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,100
also train them which in my experience

326
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,880
don't really work but that's a different

327
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,820
topic but the big driver is the

328
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:26,600
complexity and technology and that

329
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:30,800
complexity is much higher and much more

330
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:37,970
than anything else which has a big big

331
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:41,569
impact when I started hacking man learn

332
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,730
stuff etc I did and also i worked at

333
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,580
kpmg for example at deutsche bank so

334
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,560
installed firewalls did forensics so I

335
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,320
was really doing everything I was doing

336
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,609
windows security unique security

337
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,029
forensics so sample forensics

338
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:59,360
assignments I had penetration testing

339
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:00,970
source code audits database security I

340
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,620
did it all no prob

341
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:09,490
now I could cover that today with that

342
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:11,979
complexity it's impossible today you

343
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:15,730
must specialize yourself highly

344
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,799
specialized yourself otherwise your your

345
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,459
knowledge doesn't help really anything

346
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:24,158
now that's why today you have people who

347
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:26,980
do source good audits but have no clue

348
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:29,260
about let's say malware analysis because

349
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,600
it's completely different field now you

350
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,690
might do web application pen test

351
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,459
because it's any I can teach it to

352
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:40,830
anyone in two days because it's so easy

353
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:45,490
but let's say how to write an exploit

354
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:47,590
now depending on the platform different

355
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,830
and can be very very complex and

356
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:54,428
challenging now so that you have more

357
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:56,980
than one special ID field you must

358
00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:00,280
already be there for a long time so

359
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:03,190
today we have not generalists who know

360
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,928
everything very well but to have their

361
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,870
specialized field where they are really

362
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:10,539
really good but around that not that

363
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:17,070
much and this is because the technology

364
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:19,929
got so complex this has an impact an

365
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:23,320
impact you see at every security in

366
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:26,770
hacking conference now the first is you

367
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,720
have anonymity and I don't mean that in

368
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,440
a positive sense I mean is it a negative

369
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,059
sense now in all the times you got into

370
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,870
a hacking conference it could talk to

371
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:39,340
anybody and whatever that guy was doing

372
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:41,020
yeah you could understand that person

373
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,899
what he was doing and could talk with

374
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,309
him about it today you talk about the

375
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,490
next to the next person and the

376
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:51,520
conference need us God behold database

377
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,470
security oh yeah but maybe that guy

378
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,850
likes this or has to do it yeah but

379
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:59,620
let's say I do I don't know telephone

380
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,129
system security which is another complex

381
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,809
topic now VoIP etc blah completely

382
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,000
different topic there's very little we

383
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,770
can communicate about because the topics

384
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,799
are so different if we are both good in

385
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:14,049
our field so very in depth but where is

386
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:14,710
the common ground so that's where the

387
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:18,070
anonymity

388
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:23,770
from lots of people in a place with very

389
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:26,320
few things to share so in with this

390
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,210
anonymity aspect because the group gets

391
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,639
so large because there's so many more

392
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,340
security people but very little common

393
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,950
ground what has happened in the scene is

394
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:40,500
this we have everyone is kind of a lone

395
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:43,450
wolf no but wolves usually hunt in packs

396
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:47,500
only then they are effective but we are

397
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:51,730
not now so this is what i see the big

398
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:57,159
problem we have and that's something i

399
00:19:51,730 --> 00:20:00,029
also want to change here with you i try

400
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:03,340
to find a hopeful most boring picture

401
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:05,399
which shows what my feeling is if when I

402
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,860
look into the hacker and security seen

403
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:12,580
every one of you is one little pedal

404
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:14,168
pebble here yeah lying there would like

405
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,850
to talk with other people to connect to

406
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,250
other people but not really knowing

407
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,250
anybody else who has shared the same

408
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,500
interest on the specialization well it

409
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,840
gets a bit better because they are now

410
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,690
conferences who are have very specific

411
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,520
topics for example my next conference

412
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,799
where I was flying to tomorrow it's just

413
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,840
about passwords cracking password

414
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,330
hacking passwords password hashing

415
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,129
algorithms so very specialized another

416
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,199
very good conference is for example

417
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,120
recon in Montreal in June it's just

418
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,950
about reverse engineering and there is

419
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,739
also a few conferences about malware

420
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,350
analysis so there are ways where this is

421
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,950
kind of already improving now but it's

422
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:56,379
still most security conferences are

423
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,520
general security hacking yeah lots of

424
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:04,450
anonymity lots of specialized people and

425
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,580
everybody is a lone wolf yeah this

426
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,799
doesn't make me happy as a hack

427
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:13,029
old-school hacker oh I want people to

428
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:17,080
communicate to talk to each other so

429
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:19,480
what we need in the scene and the scene

430
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,529
is everyone hacking security offensive

431
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:26,440
defensive doesn't matter is you must be

432
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:28,659
good in your field and I will show you

433
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,970
how what you need for that too

434
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,979
I'm good in your field and the second is

435
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:37,539
visionary project because that is the

436
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:41,379
common ground where you connect so what

437
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:46,210
makes you successful this is the

438
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:49,029
characteristics I found are important

439
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:54,159
for everyone who get successful in the

440
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:55,899
field if it's a job for you yeah oh it's

441
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,450
a job opportunity to pay a lot of money

442
00:21:55,899 --> 00:22:02,139
it's job security for life basically in

443
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:05,799
that field you will not get good now you

444
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:08,349
need fun and passion why because you

445
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,299
will not learn it on the job will not

446
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:12,908
learn it in a training class you will

447
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:15,279
not learn it here this is only the photo

448
00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:17,769
to get into a topic but it needs your

449
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:20,619
private time at home to read something

450
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:22,869
work on something play with something so

451
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:24,820
investing your private time not your

452
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:26,889
company business time to get good at

453
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,320
something when you only do that if

454
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:31,478
you're if it's fun for you if you really

455
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,460
like the topic if sometimes you can't

456
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:35,379
get to sleep because it's like wow this

457
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,090
problem I have no idea how to solve it

458
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:39,668
but maybe it isn't and you can't sleep

459
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,809
now this is what you need if you want to

460
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:43,389
become good and this is actually true

461
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,950
about anything now you can can only

462
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:48,309
become good in something if you have the

463
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:51,570
fun in the passion the second thing is

464
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:56,139
you must be able to concentrate I know

465
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:59,139
many hackers who have talent they have

466
00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:01,149
fun they have passion for something but

467
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:04,269
I can't concentrate on one thing so I do

468
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:05,590
this oh but that's also cool oooo it and

469
00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:08,289
I don't want to do this and this and

470
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,029
this and it can't finish something now

471
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:11,950
so it's important for you to be able to

472
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:14,379
concentrate on something and really push

473
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,539
through there maybe also on two towers

474
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:19,119
but it's you must be also you must have

475
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:22,539
the ability to finish something well

476
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:26,340
otherwise that can't work the third and

477
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:29,710
now we're coming to something which is

478
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,109
get I think into the hacker side of

479
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,759
things because to concentrate something

480
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:35,439
fun and passionate you could say I need

481
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,940
that for everything I could be if I want

482
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,420
to be good manager if I want a good

483
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:46,880
salesman I need that now the naive rebel

484
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:49,340
if you are on the offensive side people

485
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,240
you are taking something people have

486
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,409
developed and try to make secure of

487
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,500
course perfect security is not possible

488
00:23:54,410 --> 00:24:00,530
but you have to find the unperfect pneus

489
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,970
so where did they go wrong so you must

490
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,960
go into the minds of what they did and

491
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,180
think about what could they have done

492
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,860
wrong they made these assumptions but I

493
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:15,650
will prove then these assumptions are

494
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:18,530
wrong now so it's a similar reason why

495
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,420
hackers usually are anti-authority now

496
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,280
because we don't like rules we don't

497
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,500
like if people say us this system is

498
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,800
secure or you must do that no we hate

499
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,840
that now we go away from that we changed

500
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:33,050
the rules and this is what hacking

501
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,050
basically is changing the rules and this

502
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:38,990
is the mindset de nieve rebel what I try

503
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,379
to communicate here I hope this somehow

504
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:45,080
come through but I'll make a test later

505
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:47,150
the first point is teaching yourself I

506
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,149
already told you if you try to be a good

507
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,680
hacker or a security guy in the

508
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,540
corporate environment in your business

509
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:57,230
time and your working hours it doesn't

510
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:59,659
work yeah so you must be able to teach

511
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,540
yourself at home also it work it doesn't

512
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,550
matter where because someone can only

513
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,649
guide you into the topic but to

514
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:08,389
understand the topic to be on top of the

515
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:15,380
topic and really learn it to the death

516
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:19,970
you must do that yourself the next one

517
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:23,900
is one I find very important talk share

518
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:26,540
connect if you try to learn something it

519
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,090
just on your own it's very very

520
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,970
difficult our dears often come from

521
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,580
talking with others one of my coolest

522
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,080
ideas I had when inventing a new tool or

523
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,840
something I usually had went with

524
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,419
talking to people now all my famous

525
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,340
tools just exists because at that point

526
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:45,590
I talk to people and it was like yeah

527
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,810
that would be cool now so it's not my

528
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:52,040
own ideas but let's say a group idea

529
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:55,210
that I then implemented now and it has

530
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,549
more characteristics we all get into

531
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:02,480
the sixth one is important for people

532
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:06,320
who are already let's say a bit famous

533
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:09,700
or well-known if you go to hacker

534
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,799
conferences with really delete people ah

535
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:17,749
you'll find several people who say were

536
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:19,490
you I don't know you yeah asshole I may

537
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:22,580
actually often fun at conference because

538
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,440
knowing someone face-to-face now you

539
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,418
know someone on this order name or email

540
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,649
address tools or something but you don't

541
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,149
know how the person looked like so

542
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:31,969
sometimes it gets so two people i know

543
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:34,248
this is that guy okay hi I'm mark they

544
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,289
don't know who I am and how they treat

545
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:39,100
me because not knowing who I am I see me

546
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:42,559
leave there an asshole or not now and

547
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,678
thankfully the asshole count is not that

548
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,999
high in the scene that's a good thing

549
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,730
but they are there are some out there

550
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:54,440
and please don't become one if you get

551
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:57,200
good the last one in the list is the

552
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,320
most important one the apps are the most

553
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,799
important one for you not for everybody

554
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:11,869
but for you and every actually everybody

555
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:18,289
here if you don't learn English you will

556
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:21,019
have no chance becoming good why because

557
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:23,840
all the important information is

558
00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:25,279
exchanged in English I'm German I also

559
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,789
had to learn English and it was pretty

560
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,460
tough now but the mailing list which are

561
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:36,049
important the conference's everything is

562
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,730
in English no Jonah is from Poland I'm

563
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:39,649
from Germany if we want to talk about

564
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,850
something what chance do we have other

565
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:46,820
than English huh that's why if you want

566
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:49,219
to become good you need you need to be

567
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:52,850
proficient in English there is no other

568
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,350
chance so beside learning python and do

569
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,379
whatever you want to do for a field

570
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,820
because this is a field which really

571
00:27:56,379 --> 00:28:02,689
interests you you must also learn

572
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:05,200
English do a class doesn't matter learn

573
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,200
English

574
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:15,110
now let's go one step back this is what

575
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:20,450
I say someone needs to really want to

576
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:23,949
become effective and successful in the

577
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:26,840
hacking environment security environment

578
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:31,299
who here you can raise just raise your

579
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:33,860
hand who hear things that's not me

580
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:39,918
anybody here who said something which is

581
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:44,270
not me I couldn't do any one good kind

582
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:49,669
of surprised but good so visionary

583
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:56,840
project what does that mean if you think

584
00:28:49,669 --> 00:29:00,679
about for example tools like Medusa

585
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,949
tools like us actually I should have

586
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:06,110
prepared that question better ok let's

587
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,960
try to reverse that you know tools like

588
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:12,770
metasploit right you know tools like

589
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,400
nmap who doesn't know n map you three

590
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:20,080
don't you do not ok then you're maybe

591
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,970
not that deep into security Nessus now

592
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,790
these are tools which were not developed

593
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,830
by one person but by many people and are

594
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:31,010
still being used today and still

595
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:34,340
deported and develop today these are

596
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:37,580
projects which really help the community

597
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:40,610
and everyone in the community now so

598
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,740
these are successful projects there are

599
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:45,678
other projects which are very hard to

600
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,900
name because you forget them people

601
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,950
started something to program something

602
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,110
and there was no interest no other joint

603
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,760
in the programmer had different

604
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:58,939
interests at some point and it's a dead

605
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,570
project there are thousands thousands of

606
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,520
them that project these are not good

607
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:08,860
projects because they were a waste waste

608
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:15,320
of time so what is a visionary project

609
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:17,600
it starts with a question why I told in

610
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,399
the beginning that that I see projects

611
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,360
as one of the main ways to get people

612
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:28,909
together you don't get together if you

613
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:31,189
say ah let's make a tool which does X ok

614
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:36,260
now not really I have better things to

615
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:39,470
do if you say I have a vision that there

616
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:42,919
should be something that enables us all

617
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:45,260
to check vulnerabilities on a system

618
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:47,419
before hackers can find him or which

619
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,379
reliably can prove that a vulnerability

620
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:53,600
exists so we don't have to hassle with

621
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,820
development or the administration so

622
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,049
they finally deployed the patches and

623
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:03,470
stuff now so if you if you connect on

624
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:06,950
values on a goal on a vision this is

625
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:12,559
something which attracts people yeah

626
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:15,110
let's take WikiLeaks for example if you

627
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,379
if you say let's do a project where

628
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:20,510
people can upload any data to make them

629
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:25,820
available to anyone under numerously how

630
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:29,540
does this sound I don't know yeah if

631
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:33,830
someone does it it's ok i guess if you

632
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:35,590
say hey corporations big corporation

633
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,059
multinational corporations and

634
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,770
governments are not accountable they

635
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:43,158
don't feel accountable what they do and

636
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:46,879
we need an oversight to dare misdoings

637
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,710
to show when they are doing bad to get

638
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,720
them in line and to actually work for

639
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,970
the people and not sometimes against

640
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,549
them how do we do to make them

641
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,620
accountable and to put them to court or

642
00:31:55,549 --> 00:32:02,330
show the public that they are doing

643
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:05,120
wrong how do we do that we create a

644
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:07,760
website where anybody can whistle blow

645
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,799
data unanimously without being traced

646
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,600
back to them and when we get public to

647
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,970
everyone so it can't be taken down and

648
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,600
make it available to reporters to inform

649
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:19,340
everybody about what the problem is

650
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:22,070
wouldn't that be a cool idea to make the

651
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,789
world better hey yeah I want to work on

652
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:29,149
that one now so that's the difference

653
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:33,889
that's why the why is so important the

654
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:35,539
why is I want I see a problem and I want

655
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:37,850
this want to make this problem go away

656
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:40,120
and this is my idea for that and if you

657
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:43,158
communicate that you will find followers

658
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:46,549
this must be the basis of every project

659
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:49,159
you strut you want to start then comes

660
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:53,440
the second question to how now with the

661
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:55,730
example WikiLeaks so konchem to have

662
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,970
some control or feedback on how

663
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,950
governments behave home what big

664
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,700
corporations do wrong how do we do it

665
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:08,119
okay we need a website where people can

666
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,980
upload unanimously viator now and we use

667
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,389
these technology and this is how we

668
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,119
distribute service or they can't be

669
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:17,240
taken down easily etc now this is the

670
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:19,490
how then it gets technical the water

671
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,529
stand the very specific okay we need

672
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:25,720
this we need that now this is how you

673
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:28,220
come together but it starts with the why

674
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:33,440
what's the overall goal this is how you

675
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:35,029
get the people in the boat there's a

676
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,100
very nice saying by setting soup early

677
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:39,019
on how to build a boat but I'm not able

678
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,350
to do that in English language so sorry

679
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:44,929
on that so there are some

680
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,869
characteristics which makes it project

681
00:33:44,929 --> 00:33:51,529
successful if you have a vision you can

682
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:54,309
share and people can connect to the

683
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:58,279
first one is you shouldn't be alone

684
00:33:54,309 --> 00:34:00,769
usually at some point someone quits all

685
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,619
the project and it might be you might be

686
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:06,080
you have an accident might be you get a

687
00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:08,929
job offer which is very well-paid very

688
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,918
interesting and you have to work for one

689
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:11,869
hundred percent of the time you don't

690
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,210
have time for that project anymore could

691
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:18,079
be you get pregnant your wife gets

692
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:19,639
pregnant someone gets pregnant now

693
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,919
there's a baby it gets some higher

694
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,800
priority in your life so you do

695
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,810
different stuff so being alone is a big

696
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,290
risk for a project so I should more than

697
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:32,319
one person be a founder of the project

698
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:36,580
in big supporter of the project

699
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:39,610
otherwise it dies the second is passion

700
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:44,290
again if you don't have passion for the

701
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:46,750
project you infect people with passion

702
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:49,690
if you don't have passion you don't

703
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:52,590
infect others well the other important

704
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:57,580
part is the ego leave the ego out of it

705
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:59,980
it can still work like WikiLeaks now the

706
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:03,100
founder of WikiLeaks has a very very

707
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:06,520
very big ego which just makes it very

708
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:09,190
difficult to actually like him now but

709
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,560
even without him being able to do is

710
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:15,760
still a lot he has enough followers so

711
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:18,730
it's still working now it can work with

712
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,420
ego it's better without huh so leave the

713
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:24,520
ego way join the passion always

714
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,260
communicate the vision because that's

715
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,720
what in what drives people that was

716
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,490
motivates people yes I have the same go

717
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,689
I have the same value that's good that's

718
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:38,169
where I want to go and finally make it

719
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:39,750
easy to for people to help to submit

720
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:43,120
something too broad to join the project

721
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:45,220
to submit a patch for example I program

722
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,779
on hydras or paralyzed network login

723
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:53,500
hacker I often get submissions by people

724
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:57,310
who are not very good coders sometimes

725
00:35:53,500 --> 00:36:01,600
the code sucks it sucks so much I can't

726
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:04,259
use the code now I could say do it

727
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,600
better go home now I can't use that

728
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:10,870
that's not very motivational I rather

729
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,069
say oh thank you a lot I changed some

730
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:15,400
other things in the code to make it

731
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:17,530
better so it works at less bugs etc take

732
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,230
a look what I changed and for if you

733
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,210
submit again please look what I changed

734
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:25,840
and do that for the next code as well as

735
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:28,150
lots of work for me but it helps that

736
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,370
that person learn something and maybe

737
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,230
submit something in the future now so

738
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,940
make it easy for people to join and not

739
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:35,620
kick them out just it because they make

740
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:39,280
your life hard when they're trying to do

741
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:43,410
something good so that's what in my

742
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,410
opinion makes a project successful

743
00:36:44,590 --> 00:37:01,290
we're now coming to a very special part

744
00:36:48,150 --> 00:37:01,290
um how should I start this um should I

745
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:13,650
now it should work okay I don't need to

746
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:18,310
make any changes ah don't run away joke

747
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:21,100
okay I told you there are some things

748
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:24,340
which is very very important to become a

749
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,740
successful hacker the last item was

750
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:30,040
learn English yes really really

751
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:34,419
important the one before that was share

752
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:38,620
and connect I can't tell you how often

753
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:42,250
in my life it helped me a lot that I

754
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:44,890
knew someone who did something now just

755
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:47,380
because I know that guy he worked in in

756
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,970
that area I can phone and email him and

757
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:52,030
he could help me out and the other way

758
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:56,319
around and because of all the anonymity

759
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:59,440
we have it's even more important that we

760
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:05,080
get to know people so what we will do

761
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:07,330
now is an exercise to find people which

762
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,190
i think you will never c never seen

763
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,509
before at a hacker conference and never

764
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:17,410
see again in the future in a hacker

765
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:21,330
conference but is essential so i will

766
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:23,589
explain how it works it's very easy and

767
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:27,520
then for the rest of the time until

768
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:29,920
Marion's talk with then up next you do

769
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,070
the exercise and i highly recommend

770
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,710
later continue the exercise continue the

771
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:40,900
exercise continue the exercise until you

772
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:45,390
die no joke this is what really makes

773
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,390
you successful so

774
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:53,780
after I explained everything you stand

775
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:57,550
up or keep sitting if you have enough

776
00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:00,470
people sitting around you should be

777
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:02,960
minimum of three four people maximum

778
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,580
seven people Stefan is already a little

779
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,380
bit too much but if you have seven other

780
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:10,069
people joints you split up into four

781
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:14,000
groups again so three to five is optimal

782
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:15,710
545 is optimal now but it works even

783
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,890
with i did it with ten and twelve people

784
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:21,830
in still worked yeah but important is to

785
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:24,230
find each other very important people

786
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,700
you don't know obviously how would you

787
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,770
get to know people if you're just being

788
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:31,100
around people you already know doesn't

789
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:35,630
work so you make circles with people you

790
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:38,650
don't know three to seven and then

791
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:40,880
everybody in the group after another

792
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:46,730
presents himself with the following

793
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:52,160
questions my name is I live in that city

794
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:57,620
I work in this area and I I have

795
00:39:52,160 --> 00:40:02,420
proficiency in this indecent is and I'm

796
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:06,279
interested to learn X and maybe why and

797
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:09,020
I'm a little bit curious about set it's

798
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,000
okay to ask questions about that to

799
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,280
clarify things or because you already

800
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,360
may be interested so are you do this wow

801
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,980
it's tool is totally interesting to me

802
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:22,910
after everyone in the round has

803
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:25,820
presented himself same hey that's me you

804
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:28,509

805
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:31,490
minutes to connect to talk one-on-one

806
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,080
three together doesn't matter now maybe

807
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,759
there's nobody in a group where you say

808
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,370
oh d these guys these guys are all

809
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,910
boring don't worry it's not them it's

810
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:44,839
you everybody can be interesting and you

811
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:46,399
can learn from arab anybody if

812
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,970
appropriate exchange contact information

813
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:54,560
phone number email and i can tell you

814
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:57,830
this exercise has enabled already a lot

815
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,310
for people so if you're a hacker and

816
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:04,190
hacker means trying out new things

817
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:09,170
trying to change something getting to

818
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:11,720
know other people this is for you so now

819
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:14,030
form that is if everybody stand up
