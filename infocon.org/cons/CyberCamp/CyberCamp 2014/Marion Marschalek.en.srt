so today I'm gonna be speaking about if

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:03,320
you had three wishes what would they be

21
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:05,880
i'll be speaking about misperceptions in

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,900
secure Diego speaking about obstacles of

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,949
young people like your yang todo tipo

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,619
obstacles Eddie face when they want to

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,170
enter the information security field so

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,030
if I'm asking everyone dafina to think

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,100
about a wasted you would have or

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,680
something that you would like to be in

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,919
your life to have yet think about a wish

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,619
and I'm actually a pizza really sure

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,600
that anyways she might come up with will

32
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:36,090
for pretty sure not look like this this

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,929
might be an awkward a picture from love

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,090
you and estatal de da like very much the

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,479
fire would have to think about a we

36
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,280
should i have um if I went half on

37
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,490
already I would wish for a license

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,360
pediste oh gosh when I de pro license

39
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,579
and today I'm gonna give you an

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,229
introduction on how i Ken to death wish

41
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,360
oh I think the switches important and

42
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,640
why I would love to have a lot more

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,179
people around who actually have the same

44
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,730
question

45
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,740
so the problem that especially my

46
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,390
industry faces today is love people look

47
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,449
at this kind of screen and they don't

48
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:14,320
think it looks anything fancy they don't

49
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:15,609
find this picture appealing so today

50
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,900
we're going to talk about why this is

51
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,990
the case and why there should be more

52
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,480
people being enthusiastic in reverse

53
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,000
engineering Melbourne and the second

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,290
part of my talk I will be speaking about

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,770
different obstacles that the industry

56
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,060
itself faces for having too few

57
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,430
specialists arriving to a few engaged

58
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,200
people actually why I like to work on

59
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:40,239
problems to faces I'd like to provide

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,010
solutions my name is Marian as the

61
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,510
moderator already told you I'm a

62
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,120
Melbourne analyst and reverse engineer i

63
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,739
work for a company based in california

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,900
in santa clara named ciphered

65
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,989
incorporated what this company does is

66
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,300
work on threat detection we try to

67
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:58,450
provide new tools and new security

68
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,190
solutions to detect threats and exactly

69
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,220
this the science of detecting threats

70
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,050
today is having big troubles are placing

71
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,130
big problems they will be presenting to

72
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,750
you today as I mentioned the talk will

73
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,670
have to or better said three parts the

74
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,560
first of it would be my personal story

75
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,548
and now I inserted this information

76
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,500
security field and why I think it's

77
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,780
important to be here and the second part

78
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,390
of all show you some case studies on how

79
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,489
threat detection today is kind of stuck

80
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,708
or is facing problems that we can solve

81
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,750
with the current solutions we have and

82
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,860
then the third part i'll show you how

83
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,120
you could actually add to the problem

84
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:36,060
and work on a solution

85
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,220
so first of all I wanted to introduce

86
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,870
myself a bit more and give you an idea

87
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,680
of why I'm here today i was speaking

88
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,510
here today i actually have a very short

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,269
career in information security which

90
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,578
began like not not even three years ago

91
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:54,060
when i started to reverse-engineer

92
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:55,560
binaries actually i got in informatics

93
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,019
or information science a long time

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,269
before that when i started to do a

95
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,780
technical high school and try to learn

96
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:06,420
to code to develop software after that i

97
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,640
went to university where i tried to

98
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,069
learn about security about information

99
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,450
security after that I was like stuck in

100
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,208
my life because I was like one of these

101
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,978
disillusioned teenagers or post teachers

102
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,048
who didn't quite know what to do with

103
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,320
all the stuff that I learned University

104
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,539
and then I was a project which proposed

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,080
to work on malware for my final thesis

106
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:29,130
and I thought lower kind of sounds cool

107
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,330
today I meet a lot of people were

108
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,219
actually think the same thing motor

109
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,570
sounds cool it sounds challenging it's

110
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,750
like something new with something

111
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,719
exciting and I can very well understand

112
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,950
this spot I had the same thing so after

113
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,080
writing my thesis about Melbourne and

114
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,990
Melbourne analysis i started at an

115
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,669
antivirus company working there as a

116
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,110
junior analyst and actually being not

117
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,210
not really challenged with my life

118
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,620
because you might imagine that the

119
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,330
Melbourne left is busy with reverse

120
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,430
engineering malware the entire day and

121
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,580
trying to find new things and doing

122
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,289
really exciting stuff but in fact what a

123
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,669
lot of Melbourne lists do nowadays did

124
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:05,639
not reverse engineering binaries but

125
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,080
sorting binaries so what I did back then

126
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,880
in my job wasn't really challenging I

127
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,800
was moving samples from one channel to

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,080
another and trying to create signatures

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,330
who's trying to tell her the people

130
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,490
roughly what the binaries are doing but

131
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:20,940
it was not interested so after a while

132
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:22,560
being a mile run list I found there is a

133
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,849
challenge a reverse engineering

134
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,860
challenge for females throughout my life

135
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,479
was always pretty pretty scared of

136
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,890
debugger so please care

137
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,840
of these binaries because I didn't

138
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,659
understand them those always show you

139
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,150
later on humans are humans tend to be

140
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,340
scared of things they don't know so one

141
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,140
day I saw this challenge for females for

142
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,700
reverse engineering binaries night out

143
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,950
there is like a challenge dedicated to

144
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,200
females I am female I should be able to

145
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,170
do it so I started on that on that

146
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,479
challenge and worked very hard for a

147
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:56,370
long time and finally won the challenge

148
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,440
which was a big thing in my life that

149
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,420
everything like after the challenge all

150
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,860
of a sudden everything might boom all of

151
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,410
a sudden I understood that reverse

152
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,110
engineering binaries was not the biggest

153
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,150
problem humanity ever faced and actually

154
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,250
some some young and unskilled person

155
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,039
like me could do it because it's

156
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,900
something you can learn and what I see

157
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,420
today if I go to conferences like this

158
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,880
one or if I'm teaching at university or

159
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,380
I'm seeing a clasp high school students

160
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,700
they all asked the same question like

161
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,040
how do you start with that how do you

162
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,760
get into this how do you get my yard and

163
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,250
I I never have a really really good

164
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,870
answer to them because I can't tell them

165
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:39,180
anything else and let's just do it and

166
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:40,650
go out and try so today I wanted to go

167
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,390
into this problem a bit more of what

168
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,120
what keeps people from actually doing

169
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,909
this really technical really technical

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,870
tasks and what holds them back from

171
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:53,760
getting into technology technology is

172
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,680
something that in general scares people

173
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,570
more than a lot of other scientists we

174
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,530
have other so if i talk to people what

175
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,060
they actually want to do with their lies

176
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,669
it's like um no i don't think i'm gonna

177
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,530
be a low level programmer i I rather

178
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:07,080
think I want to be a journalist or I

179
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,690
want to be an author or I want to work

180
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,909
in multimedia design or I want to study

181
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,410
politics or I want to I don't know what

182
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,390
all these kind of other Sciences but

183
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:20,100
never really appeared that interesting

184
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:22,919
to me but the problem is that in our

185
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,200
modern society today we're facing all

186
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:28,590
these topics over and over again we see

187
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,840
books we see a graphical design we see

188
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,789
yeah all other sorts of multimedia we

189
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,700
see economy and politics nor everyday

190
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,280
life and experience all the time but we

191
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:41,010
don't necessarily experience the inner

192
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,950
workings of binaries on a daily basis we

193
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,659
don't necessarily experience discrete

194
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:49,289
mathematics every day and this is

195
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,180
something I also we have to change this

196
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,210
I don't want to do discrete math every

197
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,350
day in the morning for breakfast but

198
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,810
what we what we have today is like

199
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,660
people seeing the same easily

200
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,950
understandable Sciences over and over

201
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,900
again and liking them more because

202
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,789
they're actually used to it because you

203
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,710
understand it we assume it's we tend to

204
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,380
like things that we understand we tend

205
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,390
to like things that were good at and

206
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,210
we're good only at things that we

207
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,400
practice regularly so I was seeing as

208
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,510
I'm as I'm not very skilled not very

209
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,909
experienced in reverse engineering

210
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,440
binaries it scares me I'm afraid of

211
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,760
opening a debugger and and going through

212
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,950
the binary because they don't understand

213
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,270
what I'm seeing if I would understand it

214
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,440
better I would like it more if I would

215
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,469
practice more I would understand it

216
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,110
better so it's problem actually circular

217
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,150
I think if we as humans would be exposed

218
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,500
more to technology we exposed more to

219
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,270
the inner workings of technology we

220
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,559
would like it a lot more and not have

221
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,210
these obstacles of actually entering

222
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,250
these fields so finally it all boils

223
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,780
down to a question of perception I will

224
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,570
give you a practical example actually

225
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,640
prepared the story that I wrote down a

226
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,950
long time ago which is still valid I

227
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,400
want is a story about how I learned how

228
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,560
to park cars this is a very personal

229
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,640
story it's not easy for me to say no I'm

230
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,930
kidding I'm today pretty good at parking

231
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,840
cars and I want to tell you how that

232
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,849
happened so I started to drive cars when

233
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,350
I was 17 did my driver's license and I

234
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,860
always had in mind that i'm not good at

235
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,510
driving cars because naturally I can't

236
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,800
drive cars 4e well and I shall figured

237
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,030
out while doing the driver's license

238
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,819
that I'm really not called the driving

239
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,650
cars especially not at parting them so I

240
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,900
kind of past is destroyed license

241
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,129
excellent and just decided to never ever

242
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,660
park a car again

243
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:36,339
the day came and started University and

244
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:39,230
University gave me a lot of a lot of

245
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:41,149
challenges a lot of obstacles especially

246
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,730
when it when it was about getting to

247
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:44,869
class early morning so going to

248
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,819
university for me was always better

249
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:48,079
taking the car because then I didn't

250
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,579
have to take the bus which was very very

251
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,138
early so I thought the car in once

252
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:52,878
University and I had this issue that

253
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,470
everyone else did the same thing and of

254
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,529
course we had a fight among the parking

255
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,420
places so every day in the morning I had

256
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,249
to do this decision to either park my

257
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,868
car in a very small spot which I

258
00:10:01,249 --> 00:10:05,360
eventually found somewhere at university

259
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:07,519
or park the car very far away and walk

260
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,369
for a long time this was needed

261
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,739
challenges to go on for five years I had

262
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:15,679
five years of time to actually get

263
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:17,389
myself to try to place the car into

264
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,499
these little spots around University and

265
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,449
you know what after five years of

266
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:22,100
ridiculous car parking it took me always

267
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:24,258
a long time to get that stupid car in

268
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,629
the slot after five years of ridiculous

269
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:29,629
parking now I'm an expert in parking

270
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:31,639
cars when I had started back then with

271
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,799
17 driving cars I was really afraid of

272
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,029
parking the car because you know you can

273
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,769
stretch the car you can spread out the

274
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:39,829
causes is a dangerous thing to park a

275
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:41,179
car so the sphere was actually something

276
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:42,979
that made me think that that would never

277
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:44,809
be good at parking cars because it was

278
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,939
something that I didn't understand and I

279
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:49,339
didn't try often us so I didn't have

280
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:52,610
practice in fact I didn't learn it

281
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,049
before I had to go to university this is

282
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,139
something it's also a question of

283
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:58,790
perception so now I'm asking you if

284
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:00,350
you're out there and you think you could

285
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,279
reverse-engineer binders do you think

286
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,899
you could be interested in this if

287
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,410
there's if you couldn't like get

288
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,940
yourself to actually try it and exercise

289
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,620
it

290
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,450
so what do you think you gather then is

291
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,920
there anything else did you think you

292
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,900
could actually want to achieve the not

293
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:24,020
able to yet because I think everyone can

294
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:27,260
learn everything and on the other side

295
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:29,460
starting the second point today

296
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,380
innovation there's something you're in a

297
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,800
very special business information

298
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,630
security business is a rather small

299
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,880
business it's a rather young business

300
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,030
and there's a lot of opportunities in

301
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,010
there and currently in in this kind of

302
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,260
business or especially in the threat

303
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,950
detection industry where I mean we

304
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,939
experience and innovation gap innovating

305
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,160
up for me is something where there's a

306
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,950
lot of a lot of space for young bright

307
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,689
minds to actually move something to to

308
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,610
find problems throughout their and

309
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:02,700
prepare solutions and provide the

310
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,140
solutions people election even I can

311
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,520
tell is very beautiful to work in an

312
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,540
industry where you do something and

313
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,310
people are actually happy that you

314
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,130
didn't they they're happy to receive a

315
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,750
new solution or receive a new idea and

316
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,310
actually happy to have you there about

317
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,840
this information gap this information

318
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,180
that provides a lot of opportunities for

319
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,280
young bright minds like you may I could

320
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:24,000
help on working on these solutions for

321
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,740
specific problems in that case of the

322
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,200
scab where does this big empty vacuum

323
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,510
that needs people like you you have a

324
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,090
lot of opportunity as a lot of chances

325
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,620
so I can make your own life better here

326
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:36,450
I will bring you some points of why I

327
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,370
like to be in this business but I think

328
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,380
it's great there's like an ongoing flow

329
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,390
of challenges information security you

330
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,680
will never get bored it's the one thing

331
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,390
there's a lot of interesting characters

332
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,979
you might have figured out conference

333
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,780
here there's interesting people running

334
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,490
around if you have talked to other two

335
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,589
other attendees you might have figured

336
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,720
out you have interesting ideas they're

337
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,880
happy to share their ideas happy to talk

338
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,230
to you maybe they're even happy to have

339
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,210
a beer with you after the conference I

340
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,610
always enjoyed going to these kinds of

341
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,800
events and sharing ideas because makes

342
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:08,670
you learn yourself so much more than you

343
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,890
do at home and reading a book the other

344
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,680
thing that I've heard before ready from

345
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,870
another speaker there is ridiculous

346
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,459
appreciation if you're a hacker out

347
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,260
there if you're able to break systems if

348
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,940
you are able to analyze binary if you're

349
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,160
actually able to do things that other

350
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,190
people don't understand

351
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,629
you receive ridiculous appreciation here

352
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,670
you have people looking up to you that

353
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:31,670
you didn't even know could ever look up

354
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,740
to you there's something at some point

355
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:38,029
yes it's ridiculous loathing it's a bit

356
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:39,980
it's nice sometimes another thing is

357
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:41,480
there's less personal competition a lot

358
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,889
of friends of mine work in businesses

359
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,800
where there's a lot of competition

360
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:49,069
there's a lot of people who want to be

361
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,779
manager of I don't actually know what

362
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:53,240
all these people are working on but

363
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:56,449
there is a lot of people storming to get

364
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,670
the same job position and in my industry

365
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,990
that's just so few people did you have

366
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,329
the better chances of actually getting a

367
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,339
cool job actually raising in your career

368
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:06,469
leather and actually get the interesting

369
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:08,120
task to do a good friend of mine she's

370
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,189
like the assistant of the assistant of

371
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,680
the person who actually has a job that

372
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:14,689
she wants to have her chances to get the

373
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,378
job I like something between five and

374
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:20,240
ten years this is somewhat reality and

375
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:21,500
I'll tell you what I'm happy with the

376
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,470
job I have because I have a job that

377
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,670
actually love I actually liked very much

378
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,380
and this is something that I would want

379
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,479
all of you also to have a job that they

380
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,029
actually likely appreciate and to have a

381
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,920
position where they are appreciated by

382
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:36,139
their bosses by their companies and by

383
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,459
their colleagues this is something which

384
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:39,529
I experienced very beautiful in

385
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:44,000
information security that there's a lot

386
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:45,620
of appreciation sometimes ridiculous in

387
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,980
our field people in general make more

388
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,630
money than in most other technology

389
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,250
industries or or lots in most other

390
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:54,889
industries which are not connected to

391
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,800
technology there's very good salaries to

392
00:14:54,889 --> 00:15:00,410
make out there you will experience more

393
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,240
freedom than you usually do if you're

394
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,670
the assistant of the assistant of the

395
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,059
guy who has to chop that you want as a

396
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,959
research information security I

397
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:10,939
experience almost freedom I don't even

398
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,430
know where it comes from like I find an

399
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:14,899
idea I tell my my manager I think this

400
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,670
could be a good thing to implement he's

401
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,649
like yeah try it and tell me what you

402
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,449
found out they have so many friends

403
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:22,189
receiving it the other way having their

404
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:23,359
managers tell them you have to do this

405
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,709
and then you have to do this and then

406
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,939
you have to do that thing and they're

407
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,670
actually not even interest is in all the

408
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:31,760
project that you get so

409
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,219
I personally think that in information

410
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,900
security research you have still chance

411
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:37,880
to realize your own dreams even if

412
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,040
you're young and you're not like very

413
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:44,030
experienced you can still do what you

414
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,650
want think it's cool and last and but

415
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,920
not least of it all you will have fun

416
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,240
trust me you will have fun if you find

417
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,469
all these problems or if you see all

418
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,420
these problems the information secure

419
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,190
yes and you provide your own solutions

420
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,439
this is rewarding if you're actually

421
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:58,640
doing something providing solutions for

422
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,200
problems of other people and they're

423
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,540
happy to get it this is very rewarding

424
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:07,010
it makes you yourself happy you will

425
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:09,380
have fun for sure alright so what is the

426
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,970
gap that I'm talking about this

427
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,460
innovation gap or all the problems are

428
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,930
rather I'm personally I told you I'm not

429
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,180
a hacker I'm not a specialist and so

430
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,880
many things but I spent some time on fri

431
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,349
detection today i want to want to show

432
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,580
you some case studies on why i think the

433
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,650
threat detection is fundamentally broken

434
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,940
why we need a lot of bright minds to

435
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,699
actually fix it or come up with new

436
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,650
ideas work better or able to to provide

437
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,140
integrated security better than actually

438
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:36,020
applied security so today i wanted to

439
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:39,740
talk to you about a case study which i

440
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:42,380
did on the end p of the tea I work in a

441
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:46,790
company we try to detect apts which are

442
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:49,250
advanced persistent threats there is a

443
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,860
fundamental problem with protection as

444
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,510
threat detection finds known threats and

445
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,340
we actually need solutions that find

446
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,920
unknown threats because this is one of

447
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,270
the attributes of apts it's malware or

448
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,370
it's a threat which hasn't been seen

449
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,050
before as we had this fundamental

450
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,060
problem threat detection always find

451
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,859
stuff which has to be known some way

452
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,190
we'll never find stuff that we've never

453
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,189
seen before

454
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,628
I'll show you a quote which very good

455
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:16,219
friend of mine came up with who was

456
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:18,378
working on the same problem on the apt

457
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,789
detection who said advanced is something

458
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:22,339
which we don't understand what

459
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:27,199
persistent is something which we just

460
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:30,440
didn't detect so with us caught in mind

461
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,230
I came up with some ideas which actually

462
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,559
make up an apt or a sophisticated

463
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:38,119
malware which from the ethical

464
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,110
perspective could make Melbourne more

465
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:44,539
complicated to detect gev detection from

466
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,860
these ideas it was seven points that I

467
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:47,980
came up with to make threats more

468
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,029
complicated when he seven points i

469
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,820
created the scholar to actually evaluate

470
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,499
some apt malware samples which i had

471
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,240
looked at before and try to evaluate

472
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:58,549
these samples of how sophisticated they

473
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,009
really are let me introduce you to my

474
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:04,369
seven points in seven sins of today's

475
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:06,590
threats see number one will be not being

476
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:08,418
unique if you have Melbourne you want to

477
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,059
infect more than one system you need to

478
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:13,039
get some abstraction in there otherwise

479
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,200
as you remember like threat detection

480
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,299
searches for patterns it searches for

481
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,159
known threats if you want to infect more

482
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,039
than one machine you create a pattern if

483
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,809
you use the same banner all over again

484
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,340
as we had it some time ago there were a

485
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:27,499
lot of runtime packers but runton

486
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,178
packers have a problem in itself they're

487
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:31,639
easy to detect because it triggered

488
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:33,619
heuristic detections but just an idea

489
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:36,320
there's other ways of actually modifying

490
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:37,759
a binary to make it unique without using

491
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,158
renton Packer we should be using

492
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,809
compiler settings that's probably the

493
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,399
interesting research on that and compile

494
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:45,080
settings are a good way to obfuscate the

495
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:47,719
binary certain way there are still

496
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,210
problems in there like the API calls the

497
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,220
binary good fat or the strings the

498
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,809
binary will contain and for these kind

499
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,090
of problems you just have to use extra

500
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:58,639
fixes integrating your malware to

501
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,918
operate the strings at runtime and try

502
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:02,539
to hide the API calls by dynamic

503
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,269
resolution so this is the first point

504
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:07,039
the second roll one binary true forever

505
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,559
doesn't work anymore because we have

506
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,590
file hash based detection which is also

507
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,330
some kind of pattern if you in fact more

508
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,449
than one machine with the same file this

509
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,460
file shows up on more than one machine

510
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,109
logically and Farage face detection is

511
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,669
working on exactly this like finding a

512
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:24,949
malicious binary in trying to find the

513
00:19:22,669 --> 00:19:29,210
same binary on other infected machines

514
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:32,539
this is bad so what you have to do oops

515
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:35,509
is regularly update the binaries we have

516
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:39,169
seen malware which lasted which does in

517
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:41,419
a interval of a few days to a few weeks

518
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:43,129
updates the binaries and just push the

519
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:45,200
fresh binary maybe with other compiler

520
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:46,519
settings to the machines to just not

521
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,549
have the same binary and the Machine

522
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:52,070
forever make you do this as an attacker

523
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:54,979
watch out to not update via service in

524
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,649
Russia or in China or maybe Taiwan

525
00:19:54,979 --> 00:20:00,710
because this could raise attention as

526
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:02,988
well rule number 3 repetitive artifacts

527
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,519
if you have a lot of malware melvar

528
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:06,499
always does change this to the machine

529
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,419
and there's a specific set of changes

530
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:10,580
which it does which we call artifacts

531
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:11,869
which sometimes are repetitive you have

532
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,119
repetitive file names you have

533
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:16,249
repetitive registry key names you have

534
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,830
repetitive persistence methods or in

535
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:21,559
filtration method if you can teach your

536
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:24,199
binary to use different names or to

537
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,809
alter the persistence method or to alter

538
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,849
the infiltration middle of the machine

539
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:30,349
you destroy patterns as a malware author

540
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:32,779
everything you want to do is destroying

541
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:35,989
patterns this is a very good way to do

542
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:37,820
this rule number four environmental

543
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:39,950
insensitivity if you write a piece of

544
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,139
malware you might want to teach the

545
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,879
malware to run and burn up because as

546
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:45,379
you know there's lots of sand boxes out

547
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:46,849
there there's a lot of analyst like me

548
00:20:45,379 --> 00:20:48,259
there's a lot of virtual machines which

549
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:49,999
are dedicated to analyze a piece of

550
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:51,769
malware if you can tell the Melbourne

551
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:54,409
just not execute there you're a lot

552
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:57,440
safer I'm telling you its own plans to

553
00:20:54,409 --> 00:21:00,470
do an apt first thing he should start to

554
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,239
do is actually decide on the targets he

555
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,970
wants a target because these have very

556
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:06,470
specific machines is a very specific

557
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,940
behaviors you can teach the malware to

558
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,359
actually just only execute on the set of

559
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:14,029
people this way you have the best anti

560
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:16,220
sentox check that could ever exist out

561
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:17,720
there if you just do not execute an

562
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,370
assistant that you do not know until a

563
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,470
target

564
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,929
rule number four singer persistence you

565
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:29,340
might have heard about the P in the end

566
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:31,440
pft Mallory tries to remain in control

567
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,439
of the infected system and there are

568
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,030
several ways of persistence methods on a

569
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,010
machine and they have all been analyzed

570
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,360
to death their security systems actually

571
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,129
watching these kind of persistence

572
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,080
methods which would be like setting a

573
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,240
specific register key or creating a

574
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,980
specific service in the machine or in

575
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,060
fact in the Master Boot Record all these

576
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,790
techniques are monitored by security

577
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,290
solutions now what I see in the past

578
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,970
which I thought was very smart was like

579
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:58,020
persistence mita that would heal

580
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:59,400
themselves from being deactivated so for

581
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,740
example you could write a memoir which

582
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,240
has like a second starts the second

583
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,790
process in the machine or start a

584
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,920
dedicated service or may interest only

585
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,470
one thread which watches no threat and

586
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,810
checks if one dedicated persists method

587
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,460
is still there still existent and if it

588
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:17,610
gets deleted with some security solution

589
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,990
you just reset it and recreated and if

590
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,429
you do not want to trust someone

591
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,670
persistence me that you could just add

592
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:26,130
them all and have big network of

593
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:27,780
persistence on the infected machine rule

594
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,690
number six the separation of layers I'm

595
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,399
analyzing a lot of malware now and most

596
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,560
of them have like a payload and the

597
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,240
runtime Packer the random Packer which

598
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,580
shows all the anti analysis and protects

599
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,490
the binary which in my eyes is pretty

600
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,560
stupid because this way me is known as I

601
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:45,300
just have to remove the random Packer

602
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,490
and they have a beautifully plain binary

603
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,370
with plain strings and plain API calls

604
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,110
so that would suggest is yeah this is

605
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,090
dangerous because antivirus solutions

606
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,709
actually in search in memory for

607
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,360
malicious payload so what actually was

608
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,430
suggested to have like an integrated

609
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,500
approach and spread the anti analysis

610
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:04,980
throughout the entire binary to protect

611
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,480
it from analysis or sandboxes or Freddie

612
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,000
section

613
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,350
finally rule number seven known spheres

614
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,840
my favorite one because I don't

615
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,100
understand it very well it's different

616
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,780
spheres what you want to like to

617
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,520
remember the a you want to be advanced

618
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,080
you want to do something that ninety

619
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,230
percent of all the Melbourne alerts out

620
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,689
there understands actually pretty much

621
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,610
all of the binaries let's say ninety

622
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,679
percent of the binaries that I see do

623
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:31,110
the same things and look the same way

624
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,450
there there are 32-bit executables which

625
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,520
are executed and every environment and

626
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,320
show me immediately what they do so what

627
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,720
you want to do is the malware analyst is

628
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,280
you want to find a new battlefield you

629
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,870
want to include the challenge but not

630
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,000
ninety percent of all the analyst can

631
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,709
analyze there's a lot of research going

632
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,630
on is there's mail were actually using

633
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,580
it what you need to do is melrose

634
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:55,290
actually integrating it into your

635
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:57,030
product so if you have all these 77

636
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,770
attributes I would say this is a very

637
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,120
sophisticated malware and let me tell

638
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,980
you something the mellower that I see

639
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,979
today or that most other people see is

640
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,090
not very sophisticated but I did for my

641
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,309
case studies coming up with these

642
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,770
endpoints and making like you're all set

643
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:12,990
of them aggregating into these seven

644
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,610
rules but you need unique binaries you

645
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,440
need irregularities you need no

646
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,209
repetitive artifacts you need to be

647
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,380
environmental sensitive you need

648
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,299
multiple persistent techniques

649
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,160
consistent evasion and you need to touch

650
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:26,730
unknown spheres these sign points you're

651
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:29,370
very sophisticated now I looked at four

652
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,780
different apt malware families and

653
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,959
figure out there's a lot of blanks in

654
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:36,299
there these seven rules i applied to the

655
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,419
black energy trojans which were like a

656
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:42,600
crimeware kit used in an apt attack the

657
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:44,040
word the havoc smeller where I didn't

658
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,840
look at all the binaries for the ones I

659
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,090
saw were like beautiful beautiful

660
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,678
windows software beautifully calling API

661
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,409
isn't showing strings everything but not

662
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,270
looking like malware the third case

663
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,340
study added on black paws you might have

664
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,500
heard about the bridge of the Torah

665
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,750
cooperation United States the black post

666
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,480
is one of the most unsophisticated

667
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,460
melrose I've ever seen now to say that

668
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,500
and the evil bunny malware which you

669
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,110
might have not heard about that was one

670
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,340
project of mine analyzing a piece of

671
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,949
malware belonging to the

672
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,100
i think is firstly calls it animal farm

673
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,660
apt anyway if you look at these kinds of

674
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,389
binaries whatever background they might

675
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,610
have and at the sophistication that you

676
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,740
add to their activities you find out

677
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,959
there's a lot of unsophisticated threads

678
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,810
out there you find out there's a lot of

679
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,780
not very complicated malware but you

680
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:35,520
know what if you look at this this this

681
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,990
car very closely it's like one blank

682
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,820
line and they're one very blank line

683
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,040
which is the black post mallory used to

684
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,570
bridge the thyroid cooperation and I

685
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,520
think financially speaking this was the

686
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,980
mail or making the most money because

687
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:49,560
the black pot smell ever managed to

688
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,620
steal more than 56 million financial

689
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:55,110
card records from target within one

690
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,639
month and I don't know how much when you

691
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,530
get for for a credit card number

692
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,840
nowadays but if you put it like ten

693
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:02,280
cents per credit card number it might

694
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,840
just as well have like more than five

695
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,889
million dollars which you can actually

696
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,090
earn with this work of one month and the

697
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:11,370
sort of idea the monomers not recive

698
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,439
instigated so much you can conclude from

699
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,659
this the Malheur is not sophisticated it

700
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,320
made a lot of money the threat detection

701
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,000
didn't work the detection was in place

702
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,760
might have shown some log and cheese

703
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,850
whatever but the entire detection logic

704
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,250
didn't work it failed and it fails a lot

705
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,260
fails a lot of time threats section we

706
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,060
have today works on the principle it is

707
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,220
searching for patterns it is searching

708
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,350
for something that it can evaluate as

709
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,640
malicious lifters nothing malicious to

710
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:43,679
see we should say it's benign so here is

711
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,480
the 11 of threat detection which I was

712
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,870
just talking about to detect a threat

713
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,340
you have to know the binary or you have

714
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,379
to know the behavior of the band you

715
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,810
have to recognize the binary because you

716
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,610
saw it before or you know what the

717
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,409
binary does to virtual machine into a

718
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,360
sandbox is something malicious if you

719
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,730
can rewrite these informations you can

720
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,889
be sure we had found malware or it can

721
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:08,070
be sure it's benign but this kind of

722
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,600
approach relies on knowing patterns if

723
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,889
the right direction doesn't have a

724
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,750
pattern telling it the behaviors

725
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,220
malicious or this binary looks like

726
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,230
something I've seen before if it's not

727
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,550
present no threat detection the plan can

728
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,960
actually tell

729
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,490
this applies to everything that searches

730
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,650
for threats in the network on the

731
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:25,270
machine in the memory and the file

732
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,820
system in the registry whatever if there

733
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,190
is no known malicious pattern there's no

734
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,540
chance of actually detecting the threat

735
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,580
so this is the information about was

736
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,230
talking about this is just only one

737
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,179
problem that we face in the industry

738
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,830
there's a lot more and I'm telling you

739
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,570
there's a big gap there's a big need for

740
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,710
talented people and for people who

741
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,820
actually want to tackle these kind of

742
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:49,060
problems so what I want to ask people is

743
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:51,370
to actually go into that field and try

744
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:56,320
very hard to succeed and to create new

745
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:59,050
solutions for us today so summing it up

746
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,860
what i think is innovation and what we

747
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:07,330
need today in our field would be for

748
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:10,570
once bright minds the second thing that

749
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:13,899
I think we need today a lot we want to

750
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:16,689
demand from people like you is mad

751
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,040
skills you need to know something you

752
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,660
need to understand something to actually

753
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,050
be able to come up with the feasible

754
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:26,230
solution and the third point which I

755
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:28,960
would want you to show is to be a driven

756
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,700
character to be actually wanting to

757
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,310
create solutions and wanting to change

758
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,810
something not run after the idea of

759
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,000
other people's but come up with your own

760
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,429
idea try to understand the problem and

761
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,560
try to come up with something new and

762
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:44,530
come up with something better so okay

763
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:48,129
are these attributes to to understand to

764
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:50,200
be smart and to be determined this is

765
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:52,300
what I think makes up innovation and

766
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:57,490
what we have desperate need for for this

767
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:59,500
innovation gap but there is but of

768
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,200
course I like events like this one today

769
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,540
or events have been to before or when I

770
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,520
when I talk to friends of mine or when

771
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,460
I'm at the school talking to young

772
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,920
people asking them about what you want

773
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,420
to do in life like yeah this sounds cool

774
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,490
what you did with the sounds fun and

775
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,500
challenging but I'm not sure if I can

776
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,290
fit in there I'm not sure if I could

777
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,160
ever manage to do this I hear this a lot

778
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,980
here the slot there might be people

779
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,799
among the

780
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,850
now let's hang out this is bogus but

781
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:27,470
there's very few people who've never

782
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,928
really had fear in their life of

783
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,669
tackling something unknown of trying in

784
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:35,780
the project that they were not sure if

785
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:39,169
they could succeed so this kind of fear

786
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:41,330
I have summed up recently in some few

787
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:43,910
quotes which I collected in only two

788
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:47,510
different conferences or I met a lot of

789
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,799
professional people which were I have to

790
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,860
learn this I don't understand what you

791
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,330
do I have to learn it I'm not sure about

792
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,629
this what you do this looks very

793
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:58,370
complicated someday I will try to learn

794
00:29:56,630 --> 00:30:01,610
this also because I think it's cool but

795
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:04,309
I can't do it now I'm not good at

796
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,570
whatever this is the worst thing to say

797
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:07,428
actually I'm not good at all maybe

798
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:11,960
there's one thing that's actually more

799
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:14,419
stirring it's I can't it was minor but I

800
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,970
get this a lot these are quotes that I

801
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:19,820
wrote down after after the second

802
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,890
conference in in a very short time and

803
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:26,510
believe me or not all these calls came

804
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:28,730
from women I myself am a very big fan of

805
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,890
diversity in information security and

806
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:33,620
actually every field and again all of

807
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,480
insecurity in insecurity especially from

808
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,850
the female characters around but tell me

809
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,040
exactly this but let me point out that

810
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:41,480
this is not the female problem this is a

811
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,040
problem that a lot of young people have

812
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,480
a lot of young people don't really talk

813
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,559
about let me see a lot of very

814
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,990
technological things a lot of very

815
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,178
complicated things and that they don't

816
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,830
start and learning them because they're

817
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:56,840
afraid they can never actually achieve

818
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,520
anything let me tell you I had the same

819
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,500
thing i was i was there at exactly that

820
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,299
point when this female reverse

821
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,799
engineering challenge came up i was one

822
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:05,210
of these females one of these youngsters

823
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,980
say like i'm not sure if you can ever

824
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,429
achieve this i was working as a

825
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:12,260

826
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:14,299
analysts day in day out i was seeing

827
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,220
them reverse engineering of single

828
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:17,720
writing reports like having really cool

829
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,480
findings I was always wondering how they

830
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:22,309
got there but I never tried myself so

831
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,679
what has challenged it to me or changed

832
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:26,360
my life in a way so i would actually

833
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:27,110
realize that there's a lot of things out

834
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,120
there

835
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,610
no there's a lot of gaps i have in my

836
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,909
head and that I could actually tackle

837
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,559
them I'm not saying that people should

838
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:38,929
go ad now and read another set of books

839
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,610
or do another set of tutorials or go to

840
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:42,860
another lecture to listen to someone

841
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,719
explaining the cool stuff what I what I

842
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,729
want you to do is actually to go out and

843
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,040
try yourself to get yourself called

844
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:52,940
project to join on a project University

845
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:55,129
to join an open source project to get

846
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,530
your own thing then to do something that

847
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,240
you think is cool you want to achieve to

848
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,799
actually finish it there's also a lot of

849
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,530
people starting a project never

850
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,530
finishing them it's just as good as if

851
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:09,770
you had never started so the final part

852
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:12,230
is to talk today is the what now I told

853
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:14,240
you a lot about what what gaps we have

854
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,870
insecurities and what you could feel and

855
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,790
how I think you should do it but I

856
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:23,030
haven't told you yet how I think you

857
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:24,770
should actually go on to the specific

858
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,840
problem before what could tell you

859
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:29,299
something I wanted to be to go ahead and

860
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,949
kick ass this is something which I would

861
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:32,389
have lost if when I was young I was

862
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,730
starting in technology i would have

863
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:37,250
loved someone to just tell me this to

864
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,799
just do things this sounds very easy to

865
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:42,980
say but a lot of people's minds is very

866
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:44,540
hard to to actually understand that you

867
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,340
have to get their hands sir and you have

868
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,470
to get their hands and stuff to actually

869
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,970
achieve something for reading books and

870
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,919
doing tutorials you get a lot of

871
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,450
theoretical information to your head but

872
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,010
what you actually need to do is apply

873
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:01,400
this information on this picture you see

874
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:04,400
a fight it looks like a very tough fight

875
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,130
I think it is i'm not sure i want to

876
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,590
introduce you a young lady which I look

877
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,070
up to a lot you see on this picture on

878
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:17,000
the left side young lady named Linda

879
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:19,549
Linda is my karate teacher two years ago

880
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,679
I started with a very specific type of

881
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:23,660
karate I started to the kioku scene we

882
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,059
had to learn how to actually kick people

883
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:28,100
and how to be kicked it sounds like very

884
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:30,230
tough I was very scared of saying this I

885
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,340
admitted I didn't actually want to go to

886
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,350
these classes because they were very

887
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,970
hard you have to do a lot of push-ups he

888
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,030
has to do a lot of exercise which I

889
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,040
wasn't able to do

890
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:42,850
and actually i think it was there where

891
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:46,320
I delivered this mindset I just tackling

892
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:49,330
the problem with the same with the same

893
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,550
questions in my head that I seen in

894
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:52,899
other papers of like and I'm not sure if

895
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,620
I can achieve this I'm not sure if I can

896
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:58,630
do this but i will try anyway because

897
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:01,149
failure especially on things that you're

898
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,160
preparing for its not a big of an issue

899
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:06,850
the bigger issues that you never try to

900
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,409
actually achieve something so yeah buddy

901
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,639
karate I'm still going to these classes

902
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,870
I'm still scared but not that much

903
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,540
anymore as in the beginning and I'm

904
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:16,120
showing progress this is something I

905
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,230
would give to you we want you two to

906
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,370
understand that you have to make

907
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,139
progress you have to start learning

908
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:23,049
something you have to try to get into an

909
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,429
end now i'm not white board yet but this

910
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,690
is one of my goals for the next ten

911
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,940
years to actually achieve this black

912
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,168
belt and let me tell you something

913
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,440
reverse engineering i learned in a lot

914
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:35,168
shorter time than karate because i think

915
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,740
it's actually easier so what I've been

916
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:41,620
telling you you have to learn things for

917
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:44,500
sure and for your personal experience of

918
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,330
yourself don't remind yourself of all

919
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,250
the things you cannot do remind yourself

920
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:50,020
of the things that you're good at remind

921
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,810
yourself of the qualities that you have

922
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:56,830
and how you can use them to achieve to

923
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:58,299
learn things that you can do this is

924
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,279
something else about the codes from

925
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,850
before people told me no I'm not good at

926
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:06,940
this I can't write code I can't analyze

927
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:09,279
malware I can't exploit stuff I can't do

928
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,170
whatever so I have these people all over

929
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,000
again telling me stuff that he cannot do

930
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,840
but you know what the stuff that I

931
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,070
cannot do didn't get me anywhere it was

932
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,690
always the things that were good at

933
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,930
we're actually supporting the other

934
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:25,480
qualities that I delivered whether they

935
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:28,259
developed over time so use the talents

936
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,880
that you have today like four examples

937
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:32,980
before starting to resin gineering I was

938
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,150
always a good writer at school my

939
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,280
teachers told me I'm very good in

940
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,510
writing I think they also told me I'm

941
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,450
not good in math where I'm not sure

942
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:43,120
about that but a lifelong I was writing

943
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:45,790
a lot I like to write reports like to

944
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,920
write blogs I was a good writer ever

945
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:49,310
actually for winning the challenge there

946
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,990
are two tasks do

947
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,930
analyzing Mel reverse engineering the

948
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:55,759
malware and writing a report I wasn't

949
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:58,310
going to analyzing elegant but I was I

950
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,780
was good and writing reports so

951
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,570
I used that skill to actually make up

952
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,730
for the liking gaps on the reverse

953
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:06,410
engineering side and you know what it

954
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,150
wasn't good report it was a 30

955
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,180
page report I wrote to the challenge

956
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:13,250
which looked awesome it didn't have all

957
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:16,370
the technical information that could

958
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,140
have found but it was a great report so

959
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,660
what I'm asking you to do with like find

960
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:22,310
out what you're good at and use that to

961
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,200
actually make up for the gaps that you

962
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:29,450
have in other fields that you would like

963
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,430
to learn the final thing which I said in

964
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,720
the beginning the dollar thing I pointed

965
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,450
out there's a lot of money to make in

966
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,870
our career I'm also having of people say

967
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:42,259
I'm not that interesting in money I

968
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:44,150
rather study philosophy or I rather try

969
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,270
to get become a journalist one day which

970
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,470
is also it's very cool fields but what

971
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,770
I'm telling these young people is like

972
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:53,089
don't forget about the money there's

973
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,520
something about money it looks that

974
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:57,830
that's how money looked like there's

975
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,110
something about the money I'm not

976
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:01,880
telling you all to get rich and honestly

977
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:03,590
I'm not interested in making all this

978
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,650
money I'm not interesting spending all

979
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:10,460
this money but what having a good salary

980
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:13,970
in mind means for you is actually this

981
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,800
can give you confidence if you're making

982
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:18,290
good money you can afford your own life

983
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,910
you have more security you can pay for

984
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:23,300
your apartment you can pay for your food

985
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:25,129
you can afford to change your job and to

986
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,630
go to some other company you can afford

987
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,310
to be unemployed for two months because

988
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,810
you're not scared if you're living on a

989
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:33,590
minimum salary you don't have this

990
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:35,600
confidence money gives you choices as I

991
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:37,600
mentioned you can choose your job you

992
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:40,069
can choose the company you want to go to

993
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,630
you might not have this choice if you're

994
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,190
living on a minimum salary because you

995
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,200
have to pay bills right everyone has to

996
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,090
be built if you have money this is not

997
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,460
the problem you can actually set out for

998
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:52,640
two months take time to choose another

999
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:55,130
project choose another job so what the

1000
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,270
money gives us roles freedom as I told

1001
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,470
you I'm not in love with the money but

1002
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,470
i'm in love with freedom

1003
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:04,359
so finally closing this talk what i want

1004
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,238
to tell you so choose your dreams

1005
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:09,940
carefully there's obstacles if you can

1006
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:13,569
identify the obstacle and actually

1007
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:15,460
achieve to get over it this might be a

1008
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:18,210
feel very entering which could be the

1009
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:20,710
dream of your life what you want to do I

1010
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,450
sort of did this I had no idea that

1011
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,329
reverse engineering binaries was so much

1012
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,549
fun but after starting in the figure out

1013
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,680
this is this is what I want to do this

1014
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:31,299
is what makes me happy I'm very happy

1015
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,489
now I'm telling you to choose the dreams

1016
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:35,380
carefully don't listen so much what

1017
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:37,599
other people say but think about what

1018
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,309
you want to do yourself with your career

1019
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,230
and make a decision sup with that

1020
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:43,599
because you can never be sure of the

1021
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:46,180
dreams you have your running after don't

1022
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,650
look like something like that I promise

1023
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,989
you I'm a reverse engineer I'm having a

1024
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:54,549
lot of fun I'm meeting great people I'm

1025
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:57,309
making money which is nice um I like

1026
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:59,980
this kind of job I like to provide

1027
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:02,109
solutions of provide information to

1028
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,299
people who actually need it and I like

1029
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:08,920
to understand things I like to take

1030
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:13,599
things apart so finally I promise this

1031
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:16,210
is the last slide with pink heading if I

1032
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,529
had three wishes coming back to the

1033
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,630
beginning of the talk if I had three

1034
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:22,420
wishes the first thing would be with

1035
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,710
everyone has unbiased choices everyone

1036
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,539
has all the information he needs to

1037
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,569
actually choose what he wants to do and

1038
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:31,630
goes out and does it again this is

1039
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:33,940
something which is I think harder for

1040
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:35,980
women than for men to leave all the

1041
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:39,819
biased information inside and just

1042
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:41,769
understand what what ideas really about

1043
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:44,529
what technology is really about and what

1044
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:47,229
they could do with it so I wish for you

1045
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:49,059
to leave the biased information aside

1046
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,099
the second wish which I would have is

1047
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:53,859
that we would all be free to think

1048
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:57,460
whatever we want just believe it or not

1049
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:59,380
there's businesses and there's countries

1050
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,880
and their societies where this is not

1051
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,880
the case people not allowed to think

1052
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,950
what they want the third wish I would

1053
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,960
want

1054
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:10,439
the security of our products are our

1055
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,180
security today to be integrated in

1056
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,450
systems to guarantee our safety and

1057
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,828
privacy now if you go out of this talk

1058
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,569
and think about what wishes you have

1059
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:20,220
what you're hunting after I hope I gave

1060
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:23,609
you some interesting ideas and what to

1061
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,078
wish for and well let's say thank you

1062
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:27,299
for your attention and if you have any

1063
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,560
questions please ask now or catch me up

1064
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,990
later I think it will be here till

1065
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,990
tomorrow thank

1066
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:52,920
if there's no questions at all thanks

1067
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,920
for a question

1068
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:03,670
hope you're now a valley could you

1069
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:08,890
repeat the seven rules again please you

1070
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:14,200
want to ride malware who knows can I

1071
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:17,470
have the slide I'm not sure I can try

1072
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:24,038
the first one was to create unique

1073
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:25,899
binaries the second one was to exchange

1074
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:28,239
the binary and the system regularly the

1075
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:33,299
third one was I know what maybe it's

1076
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:33,299
easier send you a slide deck later on Oh

1077
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:41,558
a great first one not to be unique the

1078
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:45,339
second one you have one binary its rule

1079
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:50,650
forever a third one you leave repetitive

1080
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:54,660
artifacts on the machine number four you

1081
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:56,650
are not sensitive to your environment

1082
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:00,759
number five you have a singular

1083
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:03,089
persistence method number six you don't

1084
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:06,160
care about separation of layers and

1085
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:11,069
number seven you only move and no one's

1086
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,069
fears thank you

1087
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:19,770
there's no other questions I am very

1088
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:24,770
happy to be here today and thank you for

1089
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:24,770
attention have a good time

1090
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:37,500
as you are I think the only female here

1091
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:39,450
as a speaker in the auditorium could you

1092
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,150
please tell us there was a second one

1093
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:44,609
the second one yeah wasn't there if the

1094
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:46,980
first one I have seen so I'm wondering

1095
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:49,590
if you could tell us which is the

1096
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,360
greatest challenge or difficulty that

1097
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:59,190
you have placed being a woman in this

1098
00:42:51,360 --> 00:43:00,720
into soup thank you myself seriously the

1099
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:04,260
biggest problem I always had was what

1100
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:08,459
the doubt I had myself into whatever I

1101
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:10,290
would want to achieve it was I was

1102
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,600
holding myself back from from joining

1103
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:14,300
projects which I thought sound

1104
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,290
interesting because I was afraid of

1105
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,270
embarrassing myself of joining the

1106
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:21,150
project not being good enough for the

1107
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:25,140
other team members which was

1108
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:28,320
fundamentally wrong I I was scared of

1109
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,330
starting on on the reverse engineering

1110
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,860
binaries before the challenge because I

1111
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:33,600
thought there's so many other people who

1112
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:36,630
are really good at this and doing great

1113
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,960
work if I were to start that out I would

1114
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:41,700
probably fail terribly and this was a

1115
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,830
problem until I found out that everyone

1116
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,029
fails and that failing is actually a

1117
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:48,029
good thing because when you fail

1118
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:51,390
something you learn a lot more than if

1119
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:53,160
you actually achieve something and this

1120
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,350
is something that I had to understand i

1121
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:58,710
think a lot of people have to understand

1122
00:43:55,350 --> 00:44:00,210
this because as i said i experienced a

1123
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,130
lot of people coming up asking me how

1124
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:04,430
did you start or how did you do this so

1125
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:07,700
what would you recommend to do that I

1126
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:11,669
think this is the wrong questions to ask

1127
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:14,279
what what you should ask is like do you

1128
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:17,310
have a challenge for me do you have an

1129
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,780
exercise for me do you know about any

1130
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:20,640
challenges out there do you know about a

1131
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,770
capture the flag contest where I could

1132
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,069
join you know people could get me that

1133
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:28,650
direction this is I I think the better

1134
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:30,890
questions to to ask the better direction

1135
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:30,890
to go

1136
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:39,970
all right thank you very much
