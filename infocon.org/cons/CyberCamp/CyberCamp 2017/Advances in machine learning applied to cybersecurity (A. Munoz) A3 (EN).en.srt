mananas moon a star vehicle hacia poor

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
presentation look well maybe it'll thank

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,560
you very much for introducing me just

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,130
like to say that I leave the

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,070
cybersecurity laboratory and that

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:43,199
belongs to the BBVA a group where we do

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:46,559
many things that are very there are lots

8
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:50,519
of fun so what are we going to speak of

9
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,578
the title the heading is quite ambitious

10
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:55,230
because it's called advancements in

11
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,040
machine learning applied to

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:03,148
cybersecurity I have a now so what I'm

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:08,910
going to do is to try and do away with

14
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:12,690
the myth of what AI is not good for and

15
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,539
I'd like to tell you what it is good for

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:19,050
so I'm going to summarize how to attack

17
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:22,410
machine learning algorithms so we're

18
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,929
going to take our going to make a trip

19
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:28,860
around these things so what are we gonna

20
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:33,600
do this is a very quick introduction to

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:37,650
a I even though it's true that I speak a

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,339
lot about AI but in any case I've had to

23
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,689
learn some things on cybersecurity and

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,939
I'm gonna give you a very short

25
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:49,710
introduction regarding the context of

26
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:51,329
artificial intelligence and then I'm

27
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,320
gonna tell you about things you cannot

28
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,408
use it for that is limitations many of

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,669
which lie on a defensive security and

30
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:05,820
then I'm going to speak about offensive

31
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:10,940
security which is where we see there are

32
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:13,859
more advancements now formalized a

33
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,260
formalizing of artificial intelligence

34
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,540
from the point of your security and then

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,850
conclusions so what are we going to do

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,679
in the next are 58 minutes we're going

37
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,239
to try and do away with our myths

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:32,940
regarding artificial

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:36,700
and as I've applied to cyber security I

40
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:40,090
of any use well it is or as we will be

41
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,850
speaking about it from this slide we can

42
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,030
see the different techniques that are

43
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:50,410
learned like supervised learning non

44
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:54,390
supervised and reinforcement the

45
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:58,750
traditional things like image

46
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:03,040
classification recommendation systems

47
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:05,830
etc etc so here we have a large part of

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,100
domains where would be interesting to

49
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,470
use artificial intelligence and in fact

50
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,720
it's very interesting and this chart is

51
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,580
quite very well known and by the way

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,790
there is a multitude of companies that

53
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:23,530
are trying to apply AI to the own

54
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:26,890
domains because thus they can achieve an

55
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:31,540
advantage competitive edge if you look

56
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:33,160
at this chart chart the part on security

57
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,380
is very small there are many scenarios

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,010
where AI is very useful indeed

59
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,960
but in the security they are very but

60
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,590
there are very few companies

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:48,340
specializing in security some companies

62
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:52,990
are trying to apply it but there are not

63
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,970
many companies that specialize in during

64
00:03:52,990 --> 00:04:00,780
the potential of these algorithms

65
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:03,400
applied to security and not let me move

66
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,640
well there are some areas that are of

67
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,850
great concern the regarding AI have

68
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,519
related to this this has to do to

69
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,489
whether these so this software can be

70
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,190
controlled by humans if they could reach

71
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:21,250
a stage where they would be harmful for

72
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:24,010
humans understand difficult after 1 min

73
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,570
take some time right now few pictures of

74
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,810
scientists who are working with

75
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,070
artificial intelligence where some of

76
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,370
them are well known

77
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:38,020
they teach in Stanford etc at least some

78
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:41,590
of them and one of the main problems is

79
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:45,520
right now we have to regulate the way in

80
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:48,369
which these algorithms are used to see

81
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,349
if we can cope or manage the moral

82
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,840
component in order to see whether these

83
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,990
algorithms are going to be good or not

84
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,179
there are many cases comportamiento how

85
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:05,680
I am iterator replicates the negative

86
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:09,600
attitudes of humans like racism etc and

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,670
this not only affect the net saving

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,870
safety but this is also related to

89
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:19,150
society and the economics and there are

90
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,480
many people that are proposing a

91
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:25,270
universal source of income so that by

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:29,230
the time that the AI is more developed

93
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:32,820
those people we won't be able to find a

94
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:35,770
job we'll be able to get an income via

95
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,140
taxes are paid by artificial

96
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:43,030
intelligence this sounds like something

97
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:45,630
out of a movie but nowadays they have we

98
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:50,020
have many other problems perhaps

99
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:53,640
tomorrow we will be murdered by a robot

100
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:56,560
but there may be other problems such as

101
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,450
wars between different cultures and the

102
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,220
problem is that we need artificial

103
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:04,599
intelligence in order to solve more real

104
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,600
problems that will affect us as a

105
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:10,420
species so obviously we can not do

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,300
without AI we need to develop it more

107
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:15,760
and more even though we run the risk of

108
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,130
reaching up where we won't be able to

109
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,969
control it and in fact when we speak

110
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:28,759
about the rapid of evolution

111
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:33,199
ái we tend to show just like this of

112
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:39,569
algorithms here we have several examples

113
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:44,399
here we have a game that top and we can

114
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:48,089
come up with specific algorithms that in

115
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:51,089
specific tasks will achieve better

116
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:53,189
outcomes or results than humans will

117
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:56,669
would reach when solving specific

118
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:59,669
problems this is the alphago zero and so

119
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:03,119
AI will be substituting humans in some

120
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,029
areas but the true thing is that this is

121
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:08,789
not all the way true and that we speak

122
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:11,789
about singularity this precise moment

123
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:20,969
where an artificial intelligence will be

124
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:23,669
able to perform better humans specific

125
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:26,069
tasks the problem is that there's a lot

126
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:28,919
of uncertainty nobody knows when this is

127
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:31,379
going to happen it is bound to help

128
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:34,349
happen but we don't know when the most

129
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:45,919
rigorous study that we found that tries

130
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:49,229
to establishes some possible scenarios

131
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,198
when this will happen and things that

132
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:55,079
would impact us as a society so what

133
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:59,939
this study says is that from now until

134
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:03,419
the 4th and from now till 40 years ahead

135
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:06,089
of us many things will be substituted by

136
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:10,159
a high here for instance the ability to

137
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:15,529
write a book as human would do it by the

138
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:17,639
year 2040 9 writing a book by 2050

139
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:22,259
different scenarios for instance

140
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:25,439
replicating the performance of physician

141
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:29,219
and other tasks in 45 years

142
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:32,490
AI supposedly will be able to solve some

143
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:35,130
problems that only a human being can so

144
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,549
now this is an opportunity but also a

145
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,149
risk

146
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:46,089
handle this adequately so these are

147
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:51,070
things that people technicians and

148
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:52,839
specialists in technologies are dealing

149
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,480
with right now we don't know how much

150
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,470
money major companies are spending and

151
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,500
developing this technology AI has

152
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,420
evolved a lot in the last decade because

153
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,880
there are many companies investing huge

154
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,640
amounts of money in this area and

155
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,130
there's something that I'd like

156
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,880
highlighting everything related to AI is

157
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:20,680
considered like the atom born bomb and

158
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:23,620
there's parallelism with the Manhattan

159
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,620
Project when the experiments were done

160
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,260
at the beginning with this energy that

161
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:32,230
they were afraid that they would burn

162
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:36,700
the atmosphere and the same is happening

163
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,890
with AI we've detected technology with a

164
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,730
huge potential but we still don't know

165
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:49,360
whether we'll be able to handle it as a

166
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:51,880
major powers investing in these

167
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,040
technologies because supposedly in the

168
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,640
next few years the economic social a

169
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,699
military impact is going to be huge and

170
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,800
this is related to you the introduction

171
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,020
of machine learning many people speak

172
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,079
about machine learning there are some

173
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:10,300
very good courses last year in cyber

174
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,459
camp there was a very interesting talk

175
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:19,270
talked on this issue and I have about 15

176
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:22,989
minutes ahead and I'd like to touch upon

177
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,910
some issues related to AI plus machine

178
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:29,470
learning and applying to the world of

179
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:34,420
cyber security the first slide has to do

180
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:37,899
with working without complex many people

181
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,969
here I'm sure have no idea had know how

182
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,850
to apply machine learning to cyber

183
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:44,270
security and possibly nobody knows how

184
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,950
to and there's

185
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:51,350
I really like and that is part of all

186
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,300
this marketing strategy around these

187
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:55,630
technologies applied to the field of

188
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,819
security says everyone talks about it

189
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:01,370
but nobody really knows how to do it

190
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,310
everyone thinks everyone everyone else

191
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:10,180
is doing it so everyone claims they are

192
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:10,180
doing it and there's a whole scenario

193
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:17,780
technology's contributing with some

194
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:22,340
differentials that are value so the next

195
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:27,290
few minutes I'm going to try and give a

196
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:29,450
few brushstrokes this issue about this

197
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,849
subject in order to see whether we can

198
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,800
solve this problem in fact there is

199
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:38,230
something we should reflect upon and

200
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:42,109
that is whether a may solve actual

201
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,540
cybersecurity problems let me read to

202
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,850
you a paragraph of the publisher of this

203
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,040
an agenda that says this is a world

204
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,110
where massive amounts of data are

205
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,360
replacing any other tool that can be

206
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,640
applied let's forget about the human

207
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,280
behavioral theories and linguistics or

208
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,710
sociology let's forget about taxonomy or

209
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,300
psychology who knows why people do what

210
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,980
they do the important thing is that they

211
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,439
do what they do and we can do a

212
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,740
follow-up and measure it with enough

213
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,410
data figures speak for themselves

214
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,050
and this is an opinion by the publisher

215
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,790
of this journal and I'm against this I

216
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,040
oppose this opinion I believe that

217
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,520
there's a human thing to this there

218
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,860
contributes with differential on added

219
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,750
value that AI won't be able to provide

220
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:30,980
or at least not in the next few decades

221
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:35,150
and there are many stories many articles

222
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:37,660
and papers that speak and justify the

223
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:40,449
existence of many scenarios where human

224
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:43,480
component provides or

225
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:46,750
contributes with an other component

226
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,440
where these AI systems are failed there

227
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,540
are other scenarios though where I can

228
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,930
simply not be applied imagine that in

229
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,790
cybersecurity we have the best possible

230
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,819
algorithm in order to identify a user or

231
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,500
an attacker but then there's a law

232
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,920
there's a rule that prevents us from

233
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,269
applying that procedure and doesn't

234
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,180
matter whether it's good or bad

235
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:13,019
we simply cannot apply and on this slide

236
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,660
I'm giving you an example in the case of

237
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:19,269
giving a loan a bank giving a loan

238
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:22,029
and here we cannot use machine learning

239
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:25,779
algorithm well why why because due to

240
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:27,730
the data protection law says that

241
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:30,510
there's decisions that may have an

242
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:35,199
effect on the life of citizens must be

243
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:38,230
reasoned and consents and revised this

244
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:43,359
means that if you know anything about AI

245
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:46,140
we have some environments where we get

246
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,029
where we are trained there are some

247
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:51,640
entries and outputs

248
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:56,290
and we don't know how this output has

249
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:58,930
taken place we don't know why so there

250
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,540
are scenarios where this is simply not

251
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,149
possible that is we need to be able to

252
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:09,189
negotiate there needs to be a

253
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:12,640
negotiation between an entry and exit in

254
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,320
terms of security privacy identification

255
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,199
we need to bear in mind all of these

256
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,720
things because even though algorithms

257
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:21,609
work we wouldn't be able to do anything

258
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,079
about this and this is the example that

259
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,779
I wanted to tell you about this is a

260
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,989
research we did I don't know three years

261
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:32,939
ago and this is a very specific example

262
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:36,920
this was a malware detection issues in

263
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:42,049
Android with AI in this case with

264
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,729
and so we started using AI in order to

265
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:48,499
detect everything in order to detect

266
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:53,959
malware and many what's going well well

267
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:58,549
characterized that worked half way well

268
00:14:53,959 --> 00:15:04,429
but we needed more accuracy in order to

269
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:06,589
work like human analysts would so in the

270
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:10,899
case of Android applications we saw that

271
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:13,609
there were certain elements that were

272
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:16,189
differential advantage and made this

273
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:19,369
model work better there's this example

274
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:22,899
on the left and we realized that by

275
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:25,910
using natural language processing

276
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:29,449
techniques we realized that an attacker

277
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:33,618
when publishing Marwa in the Android

278
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:36,829
Market his or her description had a very

279
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:37,279
poor linguistic quality using very few

280
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:41,839
words

281
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:47,689
not many ejectives verbs per company to

282
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:50,569
the legitimate applications did better

283
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:55,759
descriptions that is longer descriptions

284
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:58,339
and much better written much richer

285
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,509
language so this proves that the human

286
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:02,959
component

287
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:06,169
still still makes a difference compare

288
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,498
wave AI which could be an addition a

289
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:12,290
compliment but by no means is it a

290
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:17,739
solution so what is actually being done

291
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:21,469
in machine learning applied to

292
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:24,429
cybersecurity well I think machine

293
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,789
intelligence is useful for defense

294
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:30,589
defense

295
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:34,850
no offense as shamea what i'm going to

296
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:37,429
show you right now has to do with public

297
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:41,089
information that's known from companies

298
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:44,029
and academic studies and part of this

299
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:45,169
top is justified by this person do you

300
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:46,740
guys know who this is

301
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:53,160
please raise your hands

302
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:56,130
that is the case this is Samir and one

303
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:59,430
of his last presentations or conferences

304
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:04,290
he said I think machine intelligence is

305
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:10,919
useful for defense no offense

306
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:12,270
this is sentence was very important for

307
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,610
me because

308
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,339
Shammi is possibly one of the most

309
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:20,059
brilliant people on earth I know I was

310
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:23,359
surprised by this because in the

311
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:28,678
presentation we are going to see that

312
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:34,320
offensive security is what has evolved

313
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:37,679
the most unlike a defensive security so

314
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:43,309
what is AI used for right now when

315
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:46,710
speaking about security or defence

316
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:50,370
security or defence traditionally

317
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:53,340
speaking normally it is used for

318
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:58,159
detecting fraud now where everything

319
00:17:53,340 --> 00:18:01,980
related to analysis and monitoring and

320
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:05,309
variant and more and more in everything

321
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:08,010
related to authentic authentication a

322
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:10,770
control official Parowan i'ma chose out

323
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:14,309
the other scenarios where it would be

324
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:17,160
very interesting to use this like in the

325
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:20,340
development of software and this is the

326
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:26,309
normal scenario where all the major

327
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:27,750
companies want to contribute where their

328
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:31,530
own thing

329
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:33,980
using a this is the normal cycle that is

330
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,980
always

331
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:46,310
presented algorithms a training process

332
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:52,399
identification etc so what public

333
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:54,889
information exists in this field we go

334
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,910
to companies and more and more we start

335
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,910
seeing projects that are starting to

336
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:05,360
distribute tutorials and information

337
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:09,770
focused on defense security we have ml

338
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:16,389
SEC for instance where we see the work

339
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:20,560
by many researchers and most of these

340
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:24,440
proposals focus on two things basically

341
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:27,470
on the one hand traffic analysis and

342
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,310
network monitoring and everything that

343
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:34,940
has to do with malware detection or

344
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:39,040
preventing malware from exploiting a

345
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:43,880
serious certain characteristics as you

346
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:46,909
possibly know these are proposed these

347
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,610
proposals major suppliers major

348
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:52,010
technological companies or security

349
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:56,149
companies are trying to use these

350
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:58,210
algorithms with their products in many

351
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:02,960
of these cases as we shall see later

352
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:04,430
technology is not that disruptive these

353
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,370
are twenty-year-old

354
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:09,380
proposals with twenty-year-old

355
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:13,219
algorithms webpart which perhaps do you

356
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:17,060
make a difference somewhat but not their

357
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,610
associated Association associated to the

358
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,070
sort of marketing related to these

359
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,800
proposals this is an example of

360
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,830
companies that have greater potential

361
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,090
from the point of view of AI you can see

362
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:34,040
a small square in red where we can see

363
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,249
some of them focused on cyber security

364
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,619
and AI

365
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:42,289
let's hear something silence we see the

366
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:44,678
names of the companies plus a couple

367
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:49,789
more I don't know if you can see them

368
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:54,710
basically countries that work in this

369
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:57,739
area is the US UK and Israel Jews are

370
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:00,080
the three main three most important

371
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:03,200
countries that work in this tension in

372
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,989
this area and they basically work on

373
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,570
network and monitoring and in everything

374
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:15,409
related to preventing software from

375
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:20,689
exploiting certain behaviors so what

376
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:22,669
prevents us from applying real AI well

377
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,700
I'm going to summarize are these things

378
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:27,739
or the one we see the amount and the

379
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,849
quantity and quality of data if any of

380
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:34,129
you use as a are probably I asked you a

381
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:36,889
question how many data do we need in

382
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:39,049
order to train the system answering this

383
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:41,029
question is difficult because the answer

384
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:43,609
normally is the more the data the better

385
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:46,159
but that's no scientific answer what do

386
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:49,009
you mean by the more data the better so

387
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,019
I guess it depends it depends on the

388
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:52,999
quality of the data what does this mean

389
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:55,519
I mean how do you measure the quality of

390
00:21:52,999 --> 00:21:58,580
the data these are abstract things and

391
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:01,159
if we apply this to cybersecurity this

392
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,399
makes things much more difficult and

393
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:07,399
prevents us from detecting as an attack

394
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:10,070
attack vectors for instance a threat

395
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:12,549
we've never seen what do we do we

396
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:18,408
normally do a profile of the normal

397
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:21,080
behavior and if it deviates from this it

398
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:24,049
means that this behavior is related to

399
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,269
human so from that point of view and

400
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:28,879
conceptually speaking we are still

401
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:32,299
working like we used to 20 30 years ago

402
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:34,189
so we haven't evolved beyond white or

403
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:36,320
black artists and there's another thing

404
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,450
that's very important that's related to

405
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:43,689
static training normally not the visual

406
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:47,590
I people trained in our systems and they

407
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:49,570
apply them but if we go underneath and

408
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,149
it will go deeper into this actual

409
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:55,210
training for real training is not an

410
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:57,820
ongoing training and by this I mean that

411
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,730
these algorithms would learn as they go

412
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,770
go with an important new ones and that

413
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,560
is that this training has to bear in

414
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:08,080
mind the presence of an active attacker

415
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,500
that is the actual proposals that are

416
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,929
being worked on is having an intelligent

417
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,880
that works about with the presence of an

418
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:20,500
attacker that will make you more room

419
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,270
succeed or fail more points that will be

420
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,490
developing more in-depth and that's

421
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:27,430
really important and everything that's

422
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:30,850
related to the privacy of algorithms and

423
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:33,970
models when we use AI we develop a

424
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,500
series of models and these models what

425
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,570
we do we publish these models can

426
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,670
somebody steal them can somebody

427
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,500
manipulate them which would affect the

428
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:45,010
security of our systems the answer is

429
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:48,880
yes and this is something we'll see very

430
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:54,340
quickly and a couple of issues in the

431
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:57,250
end and that is offense security exists

432
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,860
in AI that is today but it's possible to

433
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:03,670
manipulate AI algorithms that are used

434
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:06,520
in defense in order to provoke different

435
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:10,150
scenarios like I will show you but

436
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:13,060
normally these are targeted attacks or

437
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:16,840
mass attacks

438
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:19,780
and major openers institutions like

439
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:23,230
DARPA that willing to give lots of money

440
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:26,649
to those who can define AI systems that

441
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:29,320
will be able to learn in an ongoing way

442
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:33,040
but in the presence of an attacker and

443
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:37,480
the role of the attacker is to make this

444
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,399
system fail not work and if somebody has

445
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,290
the solution to this this company will

446
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,300
be delighted to give them lots of money

447
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:49,470
in order to you work on this so when we

448
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:53,409
speak about the real defense and offense

449
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:56,860
security we need to import we need to

450
00:24:53,410 --> 00:25:00,090
understand what a generative adversarial

451
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:07,510
Network basically we have a

452
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:14,560
discriminator that acts like what the

453
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:20,470
charge of defense makes a decision we

454
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:24,750
have generated trick the system so what

455
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:29,010
degenerate does is to enter information

456
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,010
to the discrimination

457
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:34,490
so that generator is going to be

458
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:39,740
learning as a ghost and on the other

459
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:46,370
hand the this screaming nature based on

460
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:55,750
the sample she receives it learns so it

461
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:59,139
will learn more from the attacker with

462
00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:03,530
AI where an attacker can attack a system

463
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:06,290
trying to beat it and in defense

464
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:08,450
security well this is a very complex

465
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,520
scenario for which there is no ideal

466
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,500
solution that many of the existing ones

467
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:17,480
are still being studied on a theoretical

468
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:19,070
level we don't have a lot of time I'm

469
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,500
just going to show you a couple of

470
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:26,510
examples in the area of defense security

471
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:31,430
which I believe are interesting apart

472
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:35,210
from the network monitoring once malware

473
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:38,840
detection and this is related to data

474
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:41,600
protection and I'm going to speak a

475
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,750
little bit about cryptograms

476
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,300
and I'm going to show you a research

477
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:52,970
done by Google a few years ago and the

478
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:59,139
headline said that they were able to use

479
00:26:52,970 --> 00:27:03,470
a single use algorithms cryptographic

480
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:06,580
single use algorithms and we have this

481
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:10,340
system like the one I showed you earlier

482
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:12,710
whereby Alice and Bob want to encrypt

483
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,860
information in this communication we

484
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:18,440
have the presence of an attacker

485
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:21,350
she's a neural network so Alice and Bob

486
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,430
without saying anything or because of

487
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:28,820
the way that the network is working they

488
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:32,420
detect the presence of an algorithm

489
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:37,460
and in the algorithm is such that the

490
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:39,310
attacker could not decipher it a human

491
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,550
being wouldn't do absolutely anything

492
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:48,250
okay what is the problem about this well

493
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:52,190
a human being sees this this is

494
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:54,800
basically anyone a soliloquy told a

495
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:58,130
figure better tsunami an X or that is

496
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:02,870
what is being calculated it is a very

497
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:05,900
interesting proposal and it may entail a

498
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:07,580
significant change in cryptography here

499
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:11,150
is another example a quick simulation

500
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:14,480
we've made of this attack basically we

501
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,430
have a G a and scenario where one of the

502
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,130
neural networks is able to create

503
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:21,890
digital pictures that look very much

504
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:25,100
like pictures of celebrities for example

505
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:27,860
and in that process of deceiving the

506
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,139
detector it is hiding information behind

507
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,149
the pictures it also includes an

508
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,700
additional component that tries to

509
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:38,120
detect whether the information that's

510
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,490
been hidden is well hidden or not the

511
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,530
deduction of this study which is more

512
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,950
interesting than the one we showed

513
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:47,870
before is that with this gan system with

514
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,630
neural networks we can create new

515
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:53,659
algorithms which are more robust than

516
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:57,370
the ones that we have now if you have

517
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:59,450
the chance of taking a look at this

518
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,659
research and you know a little bit about

519
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:05,090
thin air stately and ography you will be

520
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:07,420
able to value the importance of this

521
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:11,659
study this is what we've seen about

522
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:15,380
defensive security now regarding

523
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:18,680
particular problems an issue here is the

524
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:22,820
privacy of models where do I publish

525
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,530
models and can attackers attack me this

526
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,379
is something we will understand in a few

527
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:30,260
minutes what are we trying to do in

528
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:33,800
order to protect that's an area well

529
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:37,510
crypto nets are being researched which

530
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:40,520
is the fact of creating ciphered a i

531
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,360
creating cryptography and apply it to

532
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,810
new

533
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,209
networks so if we are creating a

534
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:49,970
training model with Amazon and someone

535
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:53,870
is able to steal our model that model

536
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:58,130
would be coded that's how the attacker

537
00:29:53,870 --> 00:30:02,149
wouldn't be wouldn't be able to draw our

538
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:05,600
knowledge from there only users with a

539
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:10,760
cryptographic key would be able to use

540
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:13,750
it if this and stop working in a more

541
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:17,720
professional way in the future

542
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:20,300
stealing training models will be an

543
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,970
issue that may be solved in the future

544
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,250
and what we say in the world we said in

545
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,530
the beginning one of the main problems

546
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,200
in cyber security is that sometimes we

547
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:32,950
try to detect some things where we have

548
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,800
very small samples of information from

549
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:39,110
that is the samples we have our scars

550
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,169
and they aren't enough and on the to

551
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:44,240
make an identification will we be able

552
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:47,330
to solve that problem we don't know

553
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,610
there are other domains of application

554
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,330
where a solution has been found for

555
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:55,780
example in robotics

556
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:59,649
there is one shot learning which is

557
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:02,420
applying models with just one sample

558
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:05,450
this is what can be done in certain

559
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,880
scenarios in robotics a robot sees just

560
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:11,720
one single example and can replicate

561
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:14,630
that behavior then for example in terms

562
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,110
of languages there is the cell soft

563
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:24,980
learning for example this is what Google

564
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:28,040
does language the system is able to

565
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:30,910
understand a new language without any

566
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:35,240
training without any samples learn and

567
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:36,830
replicate that language will we are we

568
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,610
able to do that in cybersecurity

569
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:42,679
not yet will we be able to do it well we

570
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,469
don't know yet these are challenges we

571
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:49,280
are currently working on when we focus

572
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:52,190
more on offensive security we will talk

573
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,660
more closely about machine learning and

574
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,370
how

575
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:01,190
software and hardware need to be

576
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:04,169
understood as one more element in our

577
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:08,940
industry and included in pen testing

578
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:14,460
software development etc in all the

579
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:17,430
words AI is one more element that needs

580
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,740
to be included and our industry well

581
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:22,050
this was a brief introduction there

582
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,090
we're going to focus on the advances in

583
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:27,930
terms of offensive cybersecurity this

584
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:29,970
year's where the greatest progress has

585
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,070
been made we need to tell you about four

586
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:35,450
different types of attacks attacks we

587
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:39,810
know of the classic attacks which is

588
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:43,290
using AI in order to do what we usually

589
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:45,450
do with all the tools or pen testing or

590
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:50,159
hacking techniques but is an improved

591
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:53,420
way then synthetic systems that attack

592
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,850
machine learning with proposals

593
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:59,520
another type of interesting proposals

594
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:04,290
which have to do with applying machine

595
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:06,240
learning to defensive security based on

596
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:10,440
machine learning and then a fourth

597
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:14,400
category where everything goes into we

598
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:17,250
will see how we can steal a I models and

599
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:20,850
how to introduce backdoors it's

600
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:24,540
important to focus on the picture we

601
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:27,240
have on the top right corner here if you

602
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:30,840
are into pen testing and black box pen

603
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,190
testing for example this is very similar

604
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:37,439
think about that

605
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:40,200
scheme and think what an attacker would

606
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,410
be able to do if an attacker can access

607
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,130
only the inputs the entrances what can

608
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:50,010
they do and if they can only access the

609
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:53,400
outlets would can they do using that

610
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:55,770
logic we can create attacker models and

611
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:59,550
build better systems in order to avoid

612
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:03,450
attacks we will now see some examples of

613
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:05,280
each when it comes to classic attacks he

614
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:09,870
have a couple of examples

615
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:11,250
the first one is passed Gann it's a tool

616
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:15,379
that's ready for use

617
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:18,480
imagine someone steals a password

618
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:22,290
dictionary from LinkedIn on a door a

619
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,469
different network then using neural

620
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:28,469
networks you send over that list of keys

621
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:32,100
and this proposal is able to create a

622
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:34,560
cracking rule a rule that will not only

623
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:37,560
match with the keys it sing but with

624
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,370
other similar keys as well so what is

625
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,879
this for

626
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:46,350
this proves that with this technique we

627
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:52,190
can hack passwords more efficiently and

628
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:55,469
quicker also this is the proof of that

629
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:58,340
because you can generalize the rules and

630
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:03,870
then apply them in future incidences

631
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:06,810
this is an example of the last D if

632
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:10,140
where neural networks were used in order

633
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:16,970
to create sequel injection attacks when

634
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:21,330
you have the rule already instead of

635
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:27,709
following your your own criterion or

636
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:27,710
using the brute force you can reduce

637
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:36,960
that database so this is the way of

638
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:41,100
improving traditional hacking tools with

639
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:44,280
neural networks second type of attacks

640
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,900
synthetic attacks this is very well

641
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,950
known it's been under the price many

642
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:52,050
times but we have to underline that it

643
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,509
is more and more complicated to tell

644
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:57,930
real information from unreal information

645
00:35:54,510 --> 00:36:00,750
particularly in audio and video because

646
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:04,259
systems are getting more complicated and

647
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:10,140
they are able to falsify to forge system

648
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:15,190
use here somebody with a pair of

649
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:18,430
modified glasses can trick the systems

650
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:21,160
it can mislead faces here's another

651
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:26,399
example of how to manipulate a video in

652
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:30,310
real time here you can see how the

653
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:33,730
gestures of the actor on the screen can

654
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:35,799
be changed by using this program they've

655
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,140
used this with many celebrities

656
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,839
including Schwarzenegger so I encourage

657
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:46,000
you to take a look at it then there are

658
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:48,880
other programs to replicate voices with

659
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,400
just a sample of 30 seconds of

660
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:58,869
somebody's voice it is difficult to tell

661
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:02,440
from the human ear what the real speech

662
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:05,290
is and what the unreal or fake one is

663
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,839
and this is the kind of attacks that are

664
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:11,740
becoming more and more popular now the

665
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,830
third type are the offensive attacks

666
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:17,740
that I think are more interesting there

667
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:20,230
are three types of attacks evasion

668
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:23,919
attacks and poisoning attacks the first

669
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:26,130
one has to do with how to evade a

670
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,250
classification mechanism that's already

671
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:33,369
established for example if our antivirus

672
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:36,339
classifies between malware and good work

673
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:39,849
we can make the antivirus classify

674
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:41,680
malware as good we're a good where and

675
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:44,619
the other way around when it comes to

676
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,029
poisoning it is about introducing poison

677
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:48,550
into the systems so that they can

678
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:52,690
perform particular actions now talking

679
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:56,080
about offensive attacks here we have

680
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:58,150
another example of a defender and an

681
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,080
attacker competing at the same time

682
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:04,210
there is a lot of literature around this

683
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:06,190
many from the academia having to do with

684
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,800
mathematical formulae well if you're

685
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:13,060
interested we can delve into that but we

686
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,220
want it today but the goal my point is

687
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:19,480
that there are libraries that people can

688
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:20,970
download at models in an actual way

689
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,280
without

690
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:28,828
reading a lot of manuals and without

691
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:32,599
being John Nash so clever hands in deep

692
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:35,520
boning are the most developed ones

693
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:38,940
particularly clever hands which I will

694
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,819
show you some demos now and then we also

695
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,849
have deep deep pounding which is

696
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:47,009
presented as the Metasploit for machine

697
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:49,760
learning it was a very promising tool

698
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:53,790
for attacks but it's true that they

699
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,579
haven't updates it's their github for a

700
00:38:53,790 --> 00:39:00,540
few months so the project isn't dead it

701
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:02,880
is close to death anyway now I will show

702
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,740
you some example of some significant

703
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,109
attacks the most representative ones

704
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,509
from clever hands and then you will see

705
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:12,210
some videos are showcasing a little bit

706
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:16,079
type two attacks I will try to simplify

707
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:18,210
it with human words as much as I can so

708
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,599
these attacks provide two scenarios

709
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:25,020
white box and black box in white box

710
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,300
attacks what the attacker needs is to

711
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:31,259
know the entire training model and all

712
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:34,079
the configuration parameters this may

713
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,760
not be very realistic but you need to

714
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,230
have all that information once you have

715
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,170
it you need to introduce inputs into the

716
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:45,720
model and get its outputs so you know

717
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,060
the configuration you add inputs and

718
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,770
obtain outputs and with that information

719
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:56,880
you're able to generate adversarial

720
00:39:51,770 --> 00:40:00,540
examples that may lead the system to

721
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:04,050
miss classify this means two things

722
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:05,910
first the ability of performing massive

723
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:09,540
attacks imagine that a classification

724
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:15,060
system can detect numbers from 0 to 9 I

725
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:18,450
input 1 9 or 1 0 and I want the system

726
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:21,750
to classify it as something different

727
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:26,240
than 0 it doesn't matter where for

728
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:29,310
example in more where I don't want it to

729
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,109
classified as family but as a different

730
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:33,900
thing this is what we call a massive

731
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:36,630
attack on the other hand targeted

732
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:39,690
attacks are different I introduced a

733
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:43,319
zero and I always wanted to classify it

734
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:45,660
always as two or always as a nine so

735
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:50,640
depending on the system we will be more

736
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:58,499
interested in massive or in a targeted

737
00:40:50,640 --> 00:41:02,989
attack box attacks they've been widely

738
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:06,118
developed in 2017 what do they enable

739
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:08,519
they have quite an important potential

740
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:11,009
because we don't need to know anything

741
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:15,749
about the artificial intelligence system

742
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:17,700
there is a system in Google enabling a I

743
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:20,609
and I don't need to know it I don't need

744
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:25,259
to know its configuration all I need is

745
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:27,869
to make some requests that is put in

746
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:30,900
some inputs and obtain some outputs

747
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:34,529
that's perfectly feasible and these

748
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:39,390
attacks are usually against Google for

749
00:41:34,529 --> 00:41:43,019
example so what we create is a

750
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:46,109
replacement model it's as if I could

751
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:49,049
create a model at home without knowing

752
00:41:46,109 --> 00:41:53,670
anything about the system I want to

753
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:55,920
attack once I have my model I can do the

754
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:59,309
tests you know that you know wood inputs

755
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,700
I need to put into the real system in

756
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:06,390
order to generate targeted or massive

757
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:09,299
attacks that's why black box attacks are

758
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:13,499
very useful and in practical terms can

759
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:15,749
be applied to any AI we don't have a lot

760
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:19,379
of time left so I will be pretty brief

761
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:22,999
here this is an attack from clever hands

762
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,999
this would be a white box attack

763
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:33,960
ASIMO londo serum this is the simulation

764
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:36,420
I would like to deal with it in more

765
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:48,750
depth but we don't have time here you

766
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:52,350
have a few pictures you can see a lot of

767
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:55,470
number running numbers running three on

768
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:57,420
the Left you have some noise and on the

769
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,970
right you have what the classification

770
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:03,240
system would see here are several

771
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:05,339
examples and the final table that's a

772
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:20,100
summary of it all and that's the

773
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:21,900
interesting part so this this mean what

774
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,970
is this table I do have a scenario where

775
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,310
the attacker knows the model and the

776
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:29,459
configuration parameters we have inputs

777
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:32,460
and outputs and our goal is no and what

778
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,710
we have to do at the input in order to

779
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:38,910
make the system react the way we want

780
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:42,840
this is what that would be like for

781
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:48,379
example on top we have ten columns from

782
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:52,320
0 to 9 so this silly example classifies

783
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:56,790
numbers imagine we input 0 and we want

784
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:59,730
the system to identify 0 so we introduce

785
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:02,910
our input and leave it as it is now

786
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:06,360
imagine we input a serial but we want

787
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:08,819
the system to classify it as a number 1

788
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:14,150
so if you look to your right you will

789
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:19,650
see that that 0 that we introduced will

790
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:23,550
incorporate several alterations in order

791
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:28,970
to classify to to make it be classified

792
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:33,470
as 1 or s 2 or 3 that is we can create

793
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:36,299
this table to know which input in which

794
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:38,520
perturbation is input in order to have a

795
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:43,610
particular output what the

796
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:46,920
this means in many cyber security

797
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:50,220
environments white box attacks and black

798
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:53,520
box attacks allow you to do this and

799
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,740
make the classification system fail so

800
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,000
this is a current challenge now in

801
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:01,379
offensive security the number of

802
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,540
requests that you have to do to real

803
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:07,920
system needs to be as reduced as

804
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:12,259
possible for example many techniques are

805
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:16,400
able to trick Google or Amazon's

806
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:19,590
classification systems with only 800

807
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,800
requests with that you can create your

808
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:27,000
own model train it and if you want to

809
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,280
perform a targeted attack you know the

810
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,320
table you need to use in order to yield

811
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,730
a particular results here are some other

812
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,610
examples with the other tool I was

813
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:42,060
telling you about that hasn't evolved

814
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:44,730
much but the basic idea is the same mode

815
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:47,009
for black box and white box attacks and

816
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:50,430
if you have time I would recommend you

817
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:52,680
to read this paper on how to perform

818
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:55,560
black box attacks on artificial

819
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:59,279
intelligence system it has a great

820
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:03,480
potential because you can generalize

821
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:06,210
this to any algorithm of a I type number

822
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:09,510
4 this is a little bit of everything and

823
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:11,520
I'm going to underline just to one that

824
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:14,070
has to do with model stealing and

825
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:19,910
another one has to do with backdoors

826
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:19,910
what's been proved is that in many cases

827
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:27,920
we either know everything or try to

828
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:30,930
approach it to inputs and outputs

829
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,930
creating our own model in these attacks

830
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:36,480
we just tried to steal the original

831
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:41,310
model that little or Amazon is using how

832
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,560
can we do this there are many ways I'm

833
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,509
going to give you an example please

834
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:49,020
don't be scared this is a very basic

835
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:51,630
formula which is the logistic regression

836
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:53,549
formula one of the multiple algorithms

837
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:56,069
we have you know the to create

838
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:59,038
artificial intelligence how can we

839
00:46:56,069 --> 00:47:01,349
attack the system and steal the model

840
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:05,039
for example the model that Amazon is

841
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:08,789
using well in this case we need to

842
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:13,400
introduce queries and obtain the

843
00:47:08,789 --> 00:47:13,400
responses X&Y

844
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:19,369
we just have to replace in the equation

845
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:31,288
X plus B and with this we will obtain

846
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:35,279
number of equations for example we

847
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:37,979
create 100 queries for 1 sorry 100

848
00:47:35,279 --> 00:47:42,119
equations for 100 queries these are

849
00:47:37,979 --> 00:47:43,669
normal equations equations we will learn

850
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:47,069
in high school

851
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:49,680
so once you solve the equation you would

852
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:54,839
have all the configuration parameters of

853
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:57,029
this area so with M petitions input

854
00:47:54,839 --> 00:48:00,328
requests and with the outputs that would

855
00:47:57,029 --> 00:48:03,239
be enough to copy replicate or steal

856
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:06,660
those models models I as I said from

857
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:08,699
Amazon or from Google here is more

858
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,578
information if you are interested in

859
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:13,349
knowing more and the last attack I

860
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:15,209
wanted to talk to you about was the

861
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:19,019
introduction of backdoors in AI

862
00:48:15,209 --> 00:48:23,489
algorithms this starts from the idea

863
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:26,698
that people to share their AI algorithms

864
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:29,609
more and more in all the that all the

865
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:33,449
people can use it now technically we can

866
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:34,920
use backdoors in different ways would we

867
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:37,319
understand my black door in this

868
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:40,049
scenario for example if we work with

869
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:42,930
neural networks it is about introducing

870
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:44,880
more of neural networks network networks

871
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:48,749
so that the system continues working

872
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,940
normally but it now has an additional

873
00:48:48,749 --> 00:48:54,660
channel that makes the system work

874
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:59,530
otherwise this is for example useful for

875
00:48:54,660 --> 00:49:02,379
the systems that classify traffic signs

876
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:05,260
if this mechanism that controls traffic

877
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:09,100
signs had a back door we could use a

878
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:13,270
small sticker or a Mac so that the car

879
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:15,730
would stop instead of accelerating this

880
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:20,440
is really serious as you cannot control

881
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:21,130
it is an additional problem here which

882
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,950
is called

883
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:26,350
transfer learning I will give you an

884
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:28,990
example imagine a University of Research

885
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:32,980
Center develops an algorithm that is

886
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:35,319
able to identify objects in general they

887
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,450
publish it on the internet and somebody

888
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,850
takes that algorithm and what they do is

889
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:43,270
to make some minor changes so that

890
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:45,509
instead of detecting objects in general

891
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:49,330
it can detect lumps or chairs or tables

892
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:53,170
so that this is an ideal scenario where

893
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:57,930
everybody shares their knowledge but if

894
00:49:53,170 --> 00:50:01,240
there is a back door in the original

895
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:04,899
original one thanks to the transfer

896
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:06,850
learning that back door continues to be

897
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,260
that the back door will remain there

898
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:14,049
so to summarize you need to be careful

899
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:17,080
whose models you are using and where you

900
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:20,080
are publishing your models with which

901
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:23,130
provider is because there is the

902
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:25,990
technical capability of introducing

903
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:29,590
backdoors to make your systems work

904
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:31,720
differently so now in summary machine

905
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:34,620
learning allows us to create better

906
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:38,230
hacking tools the identification

907
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:41,290
authorization can be deceit with or

908
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:44,110
without machine learning it is possible

909
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:47,290
to steal models so we need to take care

910
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:50,830
of our privacy we can perform targeted

911
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:53,320
or massive attacks we can replicate

912
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:56,350
models without knowing anything about

913
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:59,380
the system then we also talked about the

914
00:50:56,350 --> 00:51:02,529
manipulation of backdoors and models and

915
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:05,170
what's very important is that these

916
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:07,720
attacks are more and more practical and

917
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:09,550
what I mean is that in many cases the

918
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,060
input information needs to be slightly

919
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:14,770
modified

920
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:18,790
the system yields the results you want

921
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:21,830
this ability is growing more and more

922
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:25,670
and in terms of digital applications we

923
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:26,779
can modify by two or three percent very

924
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:31,100
small amounts

925
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:37,670
after 600 700 or 800 requests to a

926
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:39,470
provider you can actually do it just a

927
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:43,760
couple of things regarding the

928
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:47,359
formalization of offensive security well

929
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:51,470
now everyone who wants to use these

930
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:54,530
technologies and technology or in

931
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:56,899
cybersecurity in particular they they

932
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:58,760
should apply the pen testing we are

933
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,860
currently applying you know the to check

934
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,800
how secure they are in terms of

935
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:09,820
cybersecurity and for that we have

936
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:12,730
several ways the traditional one more

937
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:15,200
related to academia creating better

938
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:17,930
algorithms but then there are others

939
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,149
that have to do with cryptography if you

940
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:22,399
know anything about cryptography hash

941
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:25,790
algorithms etc you will know that

942
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:31,910
certain functions for example m5 in hash

943
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:34,759
an attacker can provoke changes in

944
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:37,490
results so for this we can create either

945
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,830
that algorithms or use another

946
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,479
alternative which has to do with using

947
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:44,990
several algorithms at the same time

948
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:47,780
although they are insecure why because

949
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:50,839
using more than one algorithm as it

950
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:55,610
happens in many other scenarios you may

951
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:59,030
have two different inputs and achieve

952
00:52:55,610 --> 00:53:03,170
that the system doesn't classify the way

953
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:10,660
it should be here you can see x and y

954
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:14,300
and the function may work differently

955
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:18,440
this may happen with correct algorithm

956
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:21,100
for example m5 and that is quite

957
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:24,410
difficult in artificial intelligence

958
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,940
this is the same thing we may have

959
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:30,580
model that may be attacked with

960
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:35,600
offensive attacks but with the

961
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:39,350
combination of both and using the black

962
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:42,140
box we can create white box and black

963
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:45,319
box attacks so that our system doesn't

964
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:50,330
classify it more work correctly and this

965
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:54,440
is what we are working on achieve

966
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:57,310
solution so these are now the recipes we

967
00:53:54,440 --> 00:54:01,240
would need in order to make more robust

968
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:03,770
defensive security against these attacks

969
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:06,970
we are now defining the so called

970
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:10,490
rubbish class one of the usual problems

971
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:12,680
in classification is that whenever we

972
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:14,959
have an input there is an output within

973
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,299
a range of possible values we have a

974
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,060
system that identifies numbers from 0 to

975
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:22,520
10 so the output will always be a number

976
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:24,590
from 0 to 10 and in terms of security

977
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:27,830
that doesn't make a lot of sense

978
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:33,680
the ideal situation would be that 0

979
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:36,880
would be classified as 0 and if not we

980
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:39,970
would need to have a different class

981
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:44,240
going through that same way that's why

982
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:46,250
the rubbish class has been introduced so

983
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:51,020
that things that are a little bit off

984
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:54,790
the established path going to that class

985
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:58,310
we are trying to deceive the attacker

986
00:54:54,790 --> 00:55:00,860
this is a classic solution and many

987
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:04,040
companies are currently doing that but

988
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:08,840
we need to continue working so that

989
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:12,259
attackers don't gain advantage over the

990
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:15,230
defender that's why we are using deep

991
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:19,580
learning now when it comes to privacy

992
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:22,790
here we have a lot of issues many of the

993
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:27,590
references I've given you allow you to

994
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:31,450
obtain models with 93 90% accuracy and

995
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:34,760
Google in any way as it happens in

996
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:36,470
security in general we need to

997
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,299
understand theirs as a global

998
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:40,578
architecture if we are introduced

999
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:43,160
singing artificial intelligence in order

1000
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:45,559
to provide more security we need to

1001
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,859
analyze the security of the element

1002
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:52,309
itself and be aware that the fact of

1003
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:54,439
introducing AI in order to obtain a

1004
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:58,459
small percentage of improvement that may

1005
00:55:54,439 --> 00:56:03,709
be a global problem so we need to assess

1006
00:55:58,459 --> 00:56:07,999
the risk and see whether to introduce

1007
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:10,339
artificial intelligence so if you work

1008
00:56:07,999 --> 00:56:13,189
and there's or if you see people or hear

1009
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:15,739
people talking sometimes when we go to

1010
00:56:13,189 --> 00:56:17,209
the companies we ask them this kind of

1011
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:19,939
questions and they don't know how to

1012
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:22,249
answer because we need to convince them

1013
00:56:19,939 --> 00:56:26,899
that security needs to be embedded in

1014
00:56:22,249 --> 00:56:29,718
that cycle at least in the initial phase

1015
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:33,199
of the algorithms with clever hands or

1016
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:36,439
with all the tools in order to

1017
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:39,589
understand that in a real situation the

1018
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:42,828
attacker will try to deceit our a system

1019
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:45,259
and if the AI system is aimed at

1020
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:48,769
providing security well then we are in

1021
00:56:45,259 --> 00:56:51,079
trouble this is what I wanted to share I

1022
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:54,229
wanted to insist on the idea that AI is

1023
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:56,929
useful there are many domains we've been

1024
00:56:54,229 --> 00:57:00,468
using it in security for about 20 years

1025
00:56:56,929 --> 00:57:02,449
and more where detection and traffic

1026
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:05,839
controlling it's not clear what the

1027
00:57:02,449 --> 00:57:08,630
solution is but what is clear is that

1028
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:12,529
offensive security is clearly advancing

1029
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:15,679
and we need to take decisions in order

1030
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:19,400
to know what to do with algorithms and

1031
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:21,439
how to make them more secure so thank

1032
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,420
you very much for your attention I will

1033
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:25,879
be hanging out here I will be on Twitter

1034
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:28,069
on Facebook and I'll be very glad to

1035
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,870
answer any questions you may have thank

1036
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:32,080
you very much

1037
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:32,080
[Applause]
