00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:24,710
when oh and good afternoon thanks very

2
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,278
much for joining me this time of the day

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,510
thanks very much to the Spanish

4
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,870
cybersecurity Institute where they

5
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:36,500
invite my name is ana boy you're my work

6
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:39,620
for Asti nasty technologies a company

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,769
from Boulos a holding company hold curl

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:46,519
that has under its umbrella series of

9
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:49,580
companies that sell products and provide

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,379
services to other companies engaged in

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,320
digital transformation the most

12
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:58,099
important of which is as the mobile

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,000
robotics that mobile robotics as you can

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:06,070
imagine this is an engineering firm that

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,140
designs builds implements and provides

16
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,630
maintenance for the mobile logistics of

17
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,870
companies this means that we automate

18
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:18,140
the internal transportation within

19
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:22,280
companies have you ever seen an MS in

20
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:25,610
video from the warehouse of an Amazon C

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,759
can you imagine these shells moving well

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,950
they move thanks to robotics ACV

23
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,119
robotics and that's the kind of robotics

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:38,630
we do for the autumn automotive sector

25
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,329
the pharma sector a food sector in

26
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,750
aerospace so we move from cars to

27
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:47,538
airplanes we design the solution that

28
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,869
the customers needs were present across

29
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:56,090
16 countries in our main markets are the

30
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:59,420
EU and the United States my company

31
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,420
I personally develop a program called

32
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,729
talent for dot o I'll talk to you about

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,660
this program in further detail of it

34
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:10,970
later on robotics is one of the enabling

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,250
technologies of industry for that Oh

36
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,550
have you ever heard about this concept

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:20,090
industry for dough and receive for dot

38
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,080
is the term that was coined in order to

39
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,780
refer to this

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,740
the explosion that we are witnessing and

41
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,630
that will have a direct impact on

42
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,940
companies and business models we've had

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,970
previously three industrial revolutions

44
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,430
that have had a huge impact on the

45
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:42,410
economy and the first industrial

46
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,240
revolution took place when the steamboat

47
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,910
joined the productive systems second was

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:52,650
the introduction of union of electricity

49
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:55,520
and when the production changed were

50
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,070
said and the third Industrial Revolution

51
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,900
took place when the electronics were

52
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,450
introduced and now we're witnessing the

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,460
forethought and logical revolution what

54
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,290
is happening now well basically that

55
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:09,330
there is convergence all the

56
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,459
technologies back stayed connected

57
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,430
reality machine learning robotics

58
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,820
cybersecurity all of these technologies

59
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,860
are now being integrated and productive

60
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,500
systems are rocking the foundations of

61
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,750
the industry and have changed our

62
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,420
business models this has led to

63
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,090
significant changes and everything and

64
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,780
the industrial sector for you to

65
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,520
understand

66
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,580
I've brought a video like to share with

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,140
you so that you can understand the

68
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,140
implications of this concept

69
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,940
trimmin by the discovery that you could

70
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,130
use steam engines to do all kinds of

71
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,989
interesting things that was followed by

72
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,900
additional revolutions for electricity

73
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,819
and

74
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,040
computers and communications technology

75
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,230
we're now in the early stages of the

76
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,900
fourth Industrial Revolution which is

77
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,920
bringing together digital physical and

78
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,920
biological systems

79
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,000
[Music]

80
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,630
one of the features of the Sports

81
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,298
Illustrated evolution is that it doesn't

82
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:20,890
change what we are doing but it changes

83
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:23,140
us we need a different economic model

84
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,120
that will allow us to meet the basic

85
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,039
needs of every human on the planet and

86
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,590
that will be focused not on growth per

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,420
se but on maximizing human wellbeing we

88
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,580
have energy technologies that can power

89
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,980
our civilization but how do we get it

90
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,599
and implement it at the scale we need at

91
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,610
a price that people around the world can

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,500
afford if we are able to do something to

93
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,560
transform cities to make them more

94
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,390
efficient then the impact can be huge we

95
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,820
can use asset tracking you can use IT we

96
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,289
can use 3d printing to decoupled growth

97
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,690
from the resource constraints we have

98
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:55,030
the question of adding quality to

99
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,040
quantity it's really about the diverse

100
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,219
safe healthy of just world with clean

101
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,870
air clean water clean energy together we

102
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,940
are fighting to preserve our fragile

103
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:08,439
climate from irreversible damage and

104
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,659
devastation of unthinkable importance

105
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,839
the prediction of five million jobs lost

106
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:15,998
by 2022 technology is serious but the

107
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,399
main question is how will we define work

108
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:21,429
how will we share the world how can you

109
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:24,759
have a doctor that really knows a lot

110
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:27,159
about data how can you have a biologist

111
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,809
that knows about medicine we have to

112
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:30,938
create a space that enables people to

113
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:32,649
think really to think divergent thoughts

114
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:36,429
to think creative thoughts

115
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:38,499
we need new education when you training

116
00:05:36,429 --> 00:05:40,359
we're working with a world in motion in

117
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:42,129
FIRST Robotics trying to encourage the

118
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,199
students from third grade all the way up

119
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:46,329
through the end of high school to pursue

120
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,689
science math and different technologies

121
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:53,469
this ability of digital technology to

122
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:56,050
change outcomes to truly empower people

123
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:59,199
that can create a more equitable growth

124
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:03,459
fourth Industrial Revolution has the

125
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:07,179
potential to make inequalities visible

126
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:08,979
and to make them less acceptable in the

127
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:11,018
future I was the first person in the

128
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,508
world to be able to voluntarily move my

129
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:16,089
legs while stepping in a robot The Cure

130
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,860
will be possible if enough of the right

131
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:19,809
people have the will to make it happen

132
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,849
we're seeing this incredibly exciting

133
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:23,979
convergence of genome editing DNA

134
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,748
sequencing governments have a very

135
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:28,329
important role to play in enabling the

136
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:31,149
safe and effective use of technology we

137
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:33,710
need to take responsibility at every

138
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:35,999
level of society to adapt to these

139
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,159
technological challenges which are

140
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:41,370
redefining what it means to be

141
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:43,830
completely embedded in this world even

142
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,559
though we have everyday problems we have

143
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,240
to solve we have to find a way to lay

144
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:49,140
the foundations for the innovations of

145
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,670
tomorrow

[Music]

148
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:12,670
hola hola si nice and calm always as

149
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:15,400
you've seen technology is developed to

150
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,680
the interest people we need to redesign

151
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,840
a model that is more efficient we need

152
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,320
to make the most of these technologies

153
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:27,340
to develop more sustainable and adapted

154
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:30,400
models now I'm going to try to explain

155
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:33,719
to you what this new reality is about

156
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,120
and the applications of technologies to

157
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,730
specific situations what differences can

158
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:43,000
you identify between these two pictures

159
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:47,770
mobile phones right and the picture on

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,650
the top you see the situation in 2005

161
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:55,180
and 2013 when Pope Benedict was

162
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:59,469
delivering his lecture there was already

163
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:02,890
a mobile phone as you can see in the

164
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,840
lower part of the screen but in 2013

165
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,610
what we see is that technology has

166
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:12,489
democratized and everybody now has a

167
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:15,250
smartphone and is recording Pope Francis

168
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,919
during his speech what happens when we

169
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:23,590
adapt technology well we make it our own

170
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:26,080
and we use it differently so this

171
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,039
explains why we no longer take pictures

172
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,039
necessarily to others but take selfies

173
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,039
technology

174
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:39,529
is used differently what time as you can

175
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,260
see thinks we did in the past that we no

176
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:45,110
longer doing well for example and this

177
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,959
also applies to you I guess you probably

178
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,329
used a telephone booth sometime in the

179
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:55,010
past I guess so now we have what's up

180
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:59,589
we're connected in real time basis with

181
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:04,639
her friends and relatives in the past

182
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:08,180
when we had to take a flight or a train

183
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,880
we were giving a boarding card and now

184
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:15,649
we use her mobile phones in our QR code

185
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,350
to access and the Pasi went to airports

186
00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:20,300
and we were waiting during a couple of

187
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,160
hours reading a book and now we're going

188
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,139
crazy trying to get water to the

189
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,750
internet because we want to be connected

190
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:30,079
around the clock another example in the

191
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,149
past we went to visit sites monuments

192
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:35,750
some cultural events and we took

193
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:37,850
pictures and now what we do is take a

194
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:41,569
selfie and take a look at those pictures

195
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:46,160
later on so technology has changed the

196
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:48,550
way we do things other examples where

197
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,620
mentioning technology helps us and

198
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,349
shapes our behavior have you used uber

199
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:59,199
and big cities instead of the

200
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,199
traditional camps or taxis yes

201
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:09,430
and the other day was attending a

202
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:12,160
conference and I asked how many people

203
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,849
watch TV and nobody raised their hands

204
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:20,410
because young people are no longer

205
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:23,020
watching on TV or traditional TV in the

206
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,689
case of supermarkets um for example

207
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,579
Amazon how many of you have poured

208
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,930
something in ever century in the past

209
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,500
month raise your hand

210
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:34,300
Wow now Lori had how many of you have

211
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,160
gone to the supermarket during the past

212
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:44,859
month okay chicken illogical supermarket

213
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:49,959
no probably these youngsters don't go to

214
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:54,040
do their grocery shopping every day new

215
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:58,810
generations probably have never even

216
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:02,020
listened to music using cassettes and

217
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:07,800
most of new talent generations will use

218
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:11,530
Spotify or YouTube and in the case of

219
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:15,130
trips well the truth is we sometimes

220
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:18,250
don't book a room in a hotel we rather

221
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,590
go for air B&B it's cheaper sometimes

222
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:24,250
are more convenient and we have can read

223
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:26,350
the opinions published by other guests

224
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:29,940
so everything is connected

225
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:34,050
we're digital beings were primarily

226
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:38,620
providing data regarding what we like

227
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:42,490
when we consume specific services and

228
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:44,620
products we share this info with her

229
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:48,930
friends who are constantly sending

230
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:53,680
pictures we're even connected to our

231
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:56,199
Fitbit Priestley's smart watches even

232
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,859
dogs are connected there is

233
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:02,410
joke a color that can be connected to an

234
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:06,910
AP P so that we know where the dog is of

235
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:11,680
a nice okay and of course the autonomous

236
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:16,149
car or that will have an amazing number

237
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,899
of sensors embedded and as a result of

238
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:23,290
this when it's launched to the market

239
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:26,110
the car factories are already

240
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,689
considering how they cheese the inside

241
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,480
of the car because when drivers no

242
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:35,110
longer have to look to the road well the

243
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,930
space where the driver can be changed as

244
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,490
well and many car factories or plants

245
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:43,209
already think about how they can

246
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:47,459
distribute and redesign the inside of

247
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:47,459
the car of the autonomous cars that is

248
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:53,050
good

249
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:59,649
well this connectivity and there's a

250
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:01,899
huge amount of data available and this

251
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:04,510
is being to refer to these days with the

252
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:07,390
term big data and up until now we didn't

253
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:11,319
have the means to measure and process

254
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:14,589
all this information but now we do and

255
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,250
the amount of data we have now is huge

256
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:22,930
because people are constantly

257
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:26,170
interacting but when those that interact

258
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:29,709
are not people but things we will

259
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,599
witness a huge explosion of data and

260
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:33,339
we're getting prepared for that

261
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,949
explosion because everything is going to

262
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:39,550
be connected we're going to move from

263
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:43,390
smart cities connected cities connected

264
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:45,699
hospitals connected rows connected

265
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:49,720
factories everything is going to be

266
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:53,579
connected and integrated so that

267
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:58,310
processes are as efficient as possible

268
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:02,940
so that we have customers personal noise

269
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:05,790
services what happens with this huge

270
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:13,860
amount of data well that it can be used

271
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:16,230
for good purposes or for ill purposes

272
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,260
and that's why we need to talk about

273
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:23,910
cybersecurity the amount of information

274
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:26,490
is so huge that we will need to of

275
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,640
course hire cyber security experts

276
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:32,519
people like you because we will have to

277
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,160
protect ourselves from people that are

278
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,130
willing to steal our personal or

279
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,519
professional or corporate data companies

280
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,829
are investing a huge amount of money

281
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,500
because they're not only the employees

282
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:48,689
are connected and my company robots are

283
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,029
connected with everything that surrounds

284
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:55,110
them robot in my company needs to be

285
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:57,899
connected to its own software and when

286
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,000
implemented across other factories it

287
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:02,130
needs to be connected with the software

288
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,470
in that other factory or so with their

289
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,910
doors because when it moves from one

290
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,470
place to another it needs to be

291
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:12,800
connected to the door so that it can

292
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,450
have access and all those are

293
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,149
vulnerabilities that's why companies are

294
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:20,279
investing a huge amount of money or at

295
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:23,850
least some are investing a lot of money

296
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:26,520
and cyber security to protect themselves

297
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,980
from attacks because when you work for

298
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,670
other companies of ulnar ability of this

299
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:36,180
kind can lead to down times in a factory

300
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:38,189
and that translates into huge economic

301
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,219
losses I'm going to give you the example

302
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,020
of a company called PSA it has to sign

303
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:46,260
the factory of the future so that you

304
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:49,069
can see how technologies are embedded in

305
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,069
this Factory

306
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,319
[Music]

307
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:02,650
currently live in an ultra connected

308
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:06,040
world people want immediate bespoke

309
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:09,490
solutions and it's very important that

310
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:14,050
we identify these needs we have prepare

311
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:19,660
the factory of the future in the

312
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:22,750
steering Center we specify everything we

313
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,300
need the customer receives a message

314
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:30,010
telling him when he's going to receive

315
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:33,990
his new car that order is sent to the

316
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:40,030
provider everyone is connected the

317
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:43,390
storage is automated is flexible and now

318
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:47,980
let's discover the factory of the future

319
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:52,270
together the working stations as you can

320
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:55,890
see our wonderful there's great Quality

321
00:16:52,270 --> 00:17:00,310
Assurance Quality Assurance is automatic

322
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:03,400
understand by computers we control the

323
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:06,220
geometry of our parts using laser

324
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,500
technology the different parts are

325
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:12,130
connected the factory of the future

326
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,959
doesn't resort to paper everything is

327
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,069
done virtually

328
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:23,980
whenever defaults are detected what we

329
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:28,950
see is that those parts are rejected we

330
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:32,350
have also a customization of all the

331
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:35,530
products we have robots that are

332
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:39,520
assembling the different parts depending

333
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:42,310
on the requirements of the costumers

334
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:47,730
some other products are manufacturing

335
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:52,360
what we see is that the cars are then

336
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:55,420
assembled and there you can see how the

337
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,820
Quality Assurance is done everything is

338
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,970
done in a highly effective and efficient

339
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:05,439
manner recommended reality well those

340
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:09,190
are operators to work even more

341
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,970
efficiently we've implemented a new

342
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:15,730
business model based on real-time

343
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:18,700
exchanges between the factory and the

344
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:22,030
customers we see that everything is done

345
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:25,000
by machines we see also how the movement

346
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,420
between the elements is unrestricted the

347
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,070
factory of the future is the interaction

348
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:34,750
or coming together of the human

349
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:36,580
dimension and robots and when everything

350
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,300
is done a message is sent to the

351
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:46,659
customer to inform him or her that his

352
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:52,149
car is ready to be delivered the factor

353
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:57,850
of the future starts today as you can

354
00:18:52,150 --> 00:19:00,490
see in this example technology puts at

355
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,820
the very center of the customer the

356
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:10,150
customer from his own smartphone can

357
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:13,620
order his car customized car and once

358
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:18,720
that order is received the whole

359
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:23,379
processes kicks off and the car is

360
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:27,820
manufactured in an automated way and the

361
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:31,060
future my daughters will not have to go

362
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:33,760
to a car dealer to purchase a car they

363
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,520
probably will be able to purchase a car

364
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,530
through the internet that video you've

365
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:43,300
seen many technology is coming into play

366
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:45,500
big datum robotics have you realized the

367
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,259
number of robots that

368
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,389
we're manufacturing the cars we've seen

369
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:55,399
that interaction between human and

370
00:19:50,389 --> 00:20:00,110
robots those robots are AGVs those

371
00:19:55,399 --> 00:20:03,139
robots have the ast logo this factory

372
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:05,928
exists is located in France it belongs

373
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:09,258
to one of our customers called PSA it

374
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:12,440
already exists it's a pilot factory that

375
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:15,110
is being tested it's in the beta phase

376
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,169
and it will be deployed that same model

377
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,729
will be deployed across all production

378
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:24,110
centers so these technologies of the

379
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:26,929
future are already here and they're here

380
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:31,370
to say these technologies are being

381
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:34,700
tested in many different factories and

382
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:37,428
plants from different sectors I come

383
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,769
from blue lights and intercept you have

384
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:42,139
a company that have joined forces in

385
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:44,889
order to co-create different innovation

386
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:48,049
systems in order to apply technology to

387
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:51,439
productive systems for you to understand

388
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:55,279
that these technologies are already

389
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,049
being used out on the field as I was

390
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,789
saying earlier everything is

391
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,340
interconnected we're talking about a

392
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:04,429
global date do we want to be faster

393
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:06,769
swifter more flexible and we want to

394
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,559
ensure customized products and services

395
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,750
and we want to indicator for the needs

396
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:15,049
and the requirements of the customers I

397
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:17,090
mean give you some real examples of how

398
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:23,179
technologies are being applied for

399
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:25,309
example I can't mention the names of the

400
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:29,600
museums here you have the picture of the

401
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:33,379
butene Center here in San tended but big

402
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,500
data such a groggy that is being used to

403
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:38,990
collect data from the visitors

404
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:43,010
that go to different museums and based

405
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:46,870
on that and for data use humans cannot

406
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:52,280
have their communications and their

407
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:55,100
future agendas and exhibits thanks to

408
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,160
big data were able to obtain real-time

409
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:02,449
analysis of for example humanitarian

410
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:06,980
crisis there's a company that does big

411
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:10,850
data and what they did was to monitor

412
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:13,340
during Mexico's earthquake all the data

413
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,500
obtained during the minutes before the

414
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,649
earthquake and right after the

415
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,020
earthquake I have it uploaded the full

416
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:23,780
video but in the video you can see the

417
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:26,120
number of connections and communications

418
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,670
before and after the earthquake so

419
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:32,120
thanks to big data we can know that

420
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:36,560
something has happened in the face with

421
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:38,629
a greater advance for example L'Oreal

422
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,010
another company how do they think

423
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:45,290
they're applying technology

424
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,730
manufacturing connected shampoo no not

425
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:49,760
at all in the case of the real we're not

426
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,430
talking about connected shampoo but what

427
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,870
they've done is to create and then touch

428
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:57,890
it or smart

429
00:22:53,870 --> 00:23:01,040
brush that has some sensors embedded so

430
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:05,150
when you brush your hair it gives to you

431
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:09,220
and Phil on the state of your hair we

432
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:12,380
have a problem with your hair and if so

433
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:16,040
basically you they tell you where you

434
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:19,070
can buy our L'Oreal products to look

435
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,440
after your hair there's this other

436
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:25,939
company a Spanish company that has

437
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:31,700
designed a technology to control the

438
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:33,190
state of crops and depressed areas

439
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,250
through drones

440
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:41,940
another example this technology is being

441
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:45,820
used and what they do is try to identify

442
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:52,630
in an early fashion both plates for

443
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:56,110
example to ensure good harvesting ceases

444
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:58,780
another example of how we can use use

445
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:00,909
them the state-of-the-art technologies I

446
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:04,750
don't know if you like running or if you

447
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:09,970
practice running but Nike has begun

448
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:13,780
selling some sport wear that has a

449
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:17,050
specific device and the sole and says

450
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:20,200
they began selling these on sneakers

451
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:23,770
they have collected a great amount of

452
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:28,360
data from their target audience and with

453
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:30,760
that info and Nike is not considering to

454
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:35,399
sell sneakers directly they're going to

455
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:40,240
sell experiences we're going to offer

456
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:43,750
for example the experience of the New

457
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,750
York Marathon since I have all the data

458
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:49,720
that I've collected from of you for a

459
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:53,290
number of years I know that now you're

460
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:57,270
able to run a marathon so I saw you that

461
00:24:53,290 --> 00:25:00,420
experienced the New York Marathon and I

462
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:05,290
give you advice and tips regarding

463
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:08,680
eating habits training I know when your

464
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:12,040
sneakers soles are worn off and when you

465
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:14,560
need to purchase a new pair so they're

466
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:19,180
going for a more experience oriented

467
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:23,280
approach this example I like from a

468
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:27,550
company the name is Jo Cosmo geo Cosmo

469
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:32,100
is designed a PP that if you download it

470
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:35,790
in your cell phone it has a geodesic

471
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:39,370
application that makes your phone a

472
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:41,750
device able to predict earthquakes four

473
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:48,320
months before due to

474
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:52,370
the magnetic currents in the environment

475
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,189
so if we all had this downloaded inner

476
00:25:52,370 --> 00:26:00,100
cell phone we might have data about all

477
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:03,740
our sensors and we could anticipate

478
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:08,419
natural disaster such as an earthquake

479
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:13,930
we see interesting things in the fields

480
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:17,810
of sports aesthetics geology farming

481
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:19,670
medicine we have factories of the future

482
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:25,429
would you like to work in this field

483
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:27,380
when you become older I thought I was

484
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:34,070
going to have more students in this

485
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:36,620
session and this is a presentation to

486
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:40,750
give you information about what's going

487
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:43,760
on and to share that there is a whole

488
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:48,200
room for opportunities they'll suggest a

489
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,390
few examples the future will be larger

490
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,520
there will be new interaction new data

491
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:58,550
and new technologies technologies have

492
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,150
just mentioned are the ones that will

493
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:08,600
give rise to new technologies new

494
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:10,970
products and services new behaviors new

495
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,780
technologies will change the way we

496
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:17,510
behave this will also generate new

497
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:20,120
business models that's of interest to

498
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:22,940
companies everything is changing and

499
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,280
what is happening today will have an

500
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:29,390
impact in the future in they say that in

501
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:32,740
20 years time 60% of all current jobs

502
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:38,330
will disappear thanks to robotics and

503
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:40,700
artificial intelligence so the younger

504
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:46,389
audience here when you end up your

505
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:50,470
school days you will work in positions

506
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:54,669
do not exist yet so we should keep an

507
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:58,150
open mind and be aware of innovations

508
00:27:54,669 --> 00:28:00,929
you should attend this type of fora to

509
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:04,780
get to know the new technologies and

510
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:07,840
keep him in touch to those that are

511
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:11,440
developing them at the end of the day

512
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,870
what is important of this Industrial

513
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,840
Revolution what is strategic about this

514
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:19,870
technology is not technology itself but

515
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,879
people no matter how good our technology

516
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:25,750
is if we don't have people that can

517
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:28,900
develop it there's not much we can do

518
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:33,309
what is important about the industry 4.0

519
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:36,820
is the talent needed and what happens

520
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:39,129
that there isn't this talented white

521
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:42,250
this room is not full in addition to

522
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:47,409
being system is because there is a lack

523
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:53,080
of digital profiles right now in 2020 8

524
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:55,659
out of 10 youngsters will find a job in

525
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:59,918
the digital environment and we are

526
00:28:55,659 --> 00:29:04,720
already at the end of 2017 what happens

527
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:09,190
that now today there will be 1 million

528
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:13,350
jobs without the necessary digital

529
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:18,309
skills there is still a lack a gap in

530
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:20,559
digital profiles not to think about 2020

531
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:24,450
we need the people with digital profiles

532
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:28,149
people that are trained in the stem

533
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:31,690
domain which are the acronyms of science

534
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:35,020
technology technology and mathematics

535
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:38,559
and everything is going to be related to

536
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:43,539
technology or professions obviously

537
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:46,120
since careers devoted to programming but

538
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:51,000
also a lawyer will have to handle

539
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,000
technology we will have to learn about

540
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,840
data protection laws Oh

541
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,970
marketing specialist will also work in

542
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:04,640
digital companies designers will have to

543
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:09,550
be in power in the digital world to

544
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:12,910
share what they do physicians are now

545
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:17,629
implementing technology to design

546
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:20,090
predictive systems for cancer treatments

547
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:24,950
and therefore technology will permeate

548
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:35,260
all industrial sectors and how are we

549
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:42,740
doing in this regard only 26% University

550
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:49,510
students go to stem with this revolution

551
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:53,150
in hands only 26% will go to those

552
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:57,770
university studies this will be a

553
00:30:53,150 --> 00:31:01,310
challenge since 2013 to 2014 those

554
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:04,850
scientific studies in Europe where 8% in

555
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:09,050
China 40% that means that Chinese are

556
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:11,959
already in this area and if we don't pay

557
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:14,360
attention to this they will about the

558
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,730
market there is a great deal of

559
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,459
opportunities in this domain and if you

560
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:25,580
like it you should go to those studies

561
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:29,810
in 2025 7 million jobs will be in those

562
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:35,230
areas what happens about female stem

563
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:35,230
profiles only 20%

564
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:45,540
those enlisted in stem studies are women

565
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:51,830
he we were 100 people in this room which

566
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:56,370
is not the case but only 25 will be

567
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:57,629
two-seam stem studies and of women just

568
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,719
you until more

569
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:04,320
that is to say three women we have to

570
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,740
change this situation with this feature

571
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,790
ahead that is already here we should

572
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:14,640
urge this type of university studies to

573
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:18,510
have more digital profile and to fill

574
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,290
the gender gap is not that women are not

575
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:24,570
capable maybe they haven't been

576
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:27,600
communicated it is need in the right

577
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:29,450
manner that is therefore another

578
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,350
challenge we have to meet

579
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,350
when students

580
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:43,619
to sing vocational training or in

581
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:48,059
university in technical careers they

582
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:51,529
will be very much in touch with business

583
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:54,570
world in order to have a dual education

584
00:32:51,529 --> 00:32:59,789
system an education system is not coping

585
00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:01,769
with the current market pace and under

586
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:06,989
for the education system is lagging

587
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:09,679
behind the only way for companies have

588
00:33:06,989 --> 00:33:13,349
the talent they need is to develop joint

589
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:18,809
projects collaborative project so you

590
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:21,539
will live in this environment that is

591
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:24,330
needed for companies to innovate they

592
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:25,379
need you you are a generation of digital

593
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:31,289
natives

594
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:34,728
so technologies are more suited to you

595
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:37,979
all of these favors entrepreneurship and

596
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:40,320
innovation this does not mean that you

597
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:44,659
should all have your own company or your

598
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:51,739
own startup it means that you need and a

599
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:54,419
tribunal ship spirit my company is a

600
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:58,529
robotics company it just builds robots

601
00:33:54,419 --> 00:34:02,580
and I'm implementing a project really

602
00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:04,529
based on talent and stem studies it does

603
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:09,089
not really have much to do with robots

604
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:13,049
maybe an alum one but not now so we have

605
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:14,759
a small and the internal startup I work

606
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:17,730
in this company but I work for my

607
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,409
project and these type of actions will

608
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,309
be more and more present

609
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:26,099
so users have this sort of mentality we

610
00:34:23,309 --> 00:34:29,450
should all become entrepreneurs at the

611
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:33,389
end the talent needed to face this

612
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:36,509
revolution requires a digital attitude

613
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:39,990
requires creativity you are very

614
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:42,690
creative you are you self-taught

615
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:45,000
yourselves nobody has really taught you

616
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:49,168
to use whatsapp instant

617
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:53,849
or any other application you yourselves

618
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:56,699
learn on the go this capacity is highly

619
00:34:53,849 --> 00:35:01,010
value now also innovation and of course

620
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:05,970
stem competences technical and sound

621
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:12,180
training based on not technologies but

622
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:15,598
we need a good basic knowledge you will

623
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:21,000
create your own opportunities you have

624
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:24,570
to decide on the topics and go for them

625
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,359
you can do you can make your dreams come

626
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,740
true you should become responsible and

627
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,980
fight for your girls

628
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:34,109
you know number depends on your parents

629
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,010
to help you or your friends or your

630
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:40,109
peers or your teachers you should hold

631
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,960
this responsibility in your hands and

632
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:45,920
you see that then this type of fora as I

633
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:52,020
said before you are probably studying

634
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:54,119
for careers that will disappear or for

635
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,060
jobs that will no longer be there so you

636
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:59,670
need a parallel training you see them

637
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:02,400
study what you really like what you feel

638
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:06,839
passionate for and you should go on

639
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:11,970
researching and training yourselves

640
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:18,980
nobody will do it in your place this

641
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:22,319
type of initiatives to promote stem

642
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,589
talent among the youngsters

he's present in many different companies

645
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:32,200
therefore it's a great time to

646
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:35,289
participate technology companies we are

647
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,779
desperate to capture new talent because

648
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:39,099
there is a gap we need to grow as

649
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:41,890
companies we have very ambitious

650
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:44,469
strategic plans and we need talent to

651
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:48,519
realize them and there is a serious

652
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:50,999
talent crisis now but if you go to these

653
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:54,689
type studies you will not have

654
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:57,669
employment problems and the in Tibet

655
00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:00,249
organizes these sort of initiatives that

656
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:04,779
you're interested in cybersecurity and

657
00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:09,009
you can start in this subject go to all

658
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:11,710
workshops seminars etc if you enjoy

659
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:19,019
robotics after the dot you can contact

660

00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,400
there is a woman here in the screen that

670
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:53,420
the screen will switch off one of the

671
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,600
programs that we've implemented is

672
00:37:53,420 --> 00:38:07,610
called stem calendar is a program to

673
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:13,220
promote stem studies for women from 6 to

674
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:22,530
17 years old in order to fill this gap

675
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:24,720
so girls introduce those women that have

676
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:27,030
been successful in the field of

677
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:32,549
technology there are different master

678
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:37,440
classes held once a month from November

679
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:41,400
to June on Saturdays and in Santander we

680
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,940
have venue for those sessions that has

681
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:49,440
just been opened a week ago so in your

682
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:51,030
city you will have eight as speakers of

683
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,760
the highest level in the field of

684
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:56,790
science and technology is an open

685
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,600
program you can all attend with your

686
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:03,990
friends is classes are free the next

687
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:08,220
session will be on the 16th of December

688
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:11,040
at the exhibition's in La Magdalena so

689
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:18,919
the first thing we do is put the girls

690
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:21,180
in contact to state-of-the-art

691
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,970
especially so they discuss about

692
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,700
technology the objective is to create or

693
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:30,149
to have reference models the percentage

694
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:34,529
of girls that go towards science and

695
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:37,530
technology is low but in general is not

696
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:40,620
very high and those percentages are

697
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:44,730
fallen there is a lack of interest

698
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:47,890
towards these fields and we should go on

699
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:52,220
doing things to promote

700
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:54,049
the interest so that people really know

701
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:58,819
what's happening I will show you a video

702
00:39:54,049 --> 00:40:02,420
later then an eighty challenge is

703
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:05,319
another program to promote stem

704
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:09,559
vocations in the area of mobile robotics

705
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:13,099
there is an annual challenge usually in

706
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:19,579
May in the city of Burgos on the 12th of

707
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:23,420
May 2000 an ik 18 and different teams

708
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:27,099
are met and they have to design make the

709
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:29,299
prototype and build the robot that if is

710
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:34,430
overcoming the steps there will be a

711
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:42,339
final tournament in Boulos there are

712
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:46,430
different test speed obstacles the maze

713
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:48,920
different sort of races that the best

714
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:52,129
ones will have to overcome at the best

715
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:56,299
time this year we've incorporated a

716
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:59,529
second category of higher difficulty

717
00:40:56,299 --> 00:41:02,240
where students have to add different

718
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:05,569
programming techniques as well so this

719
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:13,339
little bit more complex is the one used

720
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:17,119
by non drivers vehicles and this

721
00:41:13,339 --> 00:41:20,058
tournament will become a reference at a

722
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,150
national level in the area of Robotics

723
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:26,660
and it's also a great place for students

724
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,670
to know what's going on in relation to

725
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:35,390
the state-of-the-art technology and you

726
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:37,670
can learn and implement those ideas so

727
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,259
the first two are programs to promote

728
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,770
the stem

729
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,710
[Music]

730
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:49,750
studies and the next two programs are

731
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:54,980
devoted to attract and captured talent

732
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:57,530
for my group Asti the first is called

733
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:01,520
Asti academy for vocational training

734
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:03,680
studies with dual system part of the

735
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,530
training is not carried out in the

736
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,600
classroom but in our company with our

737
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:13,880
colleagues working on real robotic

738
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:16,000
projects so that when you come or finish

739
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,630
your studies you're better prepare for

740
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:24,730
what you will find in the business world

741
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:28,490
as the college is a similar project in

742
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,990
University University students come to

743
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:33,709
our companies so that part of their

744
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:36,799
education is evaluated by the company

745
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:39,080
with this program we had from us the

746
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,560
students from the Massachusetts

747
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:45,170
Technology Institute also a Business

748
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,330
School in set is a very important

749
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:51,680
European Business School and we have

750
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:55,040
captured 27 engineers this year so I

751
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,660
think is quite good as the open future

752
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,830
is another initiative in our company

753
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:04,368
where we won't ever startup

754
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:07,140
[Music]

755
00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:10,850
promoting co-creation so that the

756
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:13,799
startups my work jointly with our I

757
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:17,880
research and development departments and

758
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:21,210
the last program is us the skills after

759
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:26,150
promoting and attracting stem studies

760
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:32,609
and stem specialization we retain those

761
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:36,030
students we develop the different skills

762
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:40,049
so that they depend in their profile and

763
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:43,170
they feel at ease in our company and

764
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:46,740
they might stay with us and I will show

765
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:49,420
you small presentation of the first and

766
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,899
us the first programs have introduced

767
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:56,490
[Music]

768
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:59,250
this is stem talent girl a project to

769
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:01,140
inspire educate and empower the next

770
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:04,500
generation of a leader

771
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:07,618
women in science and technology we will

772
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,830
all be equal in opportunities and talent

773
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:13,710
I will say this is very interesting they

774
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:17,609
fought for what they wanted to do and I

775
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:19,619
want to be like them you can listen to

776
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:21,810
advice Patricia do would you like I

777
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,880
pretty much knew what I wanted to study

778
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:25,920
but now have changed my mind I want to

779
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,530
study archaeology you know it's not a

780
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,210
matter of being right or wrong what do

781
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:31,230
you think is a mistake may not be the

782
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:35,559
case it's been an unforgettable

783
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:40,239
experience that helped me

784
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:43,390
building my journey very inspiring the

785
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:47,339
way in which those women are an impact

786
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:52,019
on us Mayson rather utopia but is true

787
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:55,589
and the talks were incredible

788
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:59,859
people that really convey their passion

789
00:44:55,589 --> 00:45:03,130
they communicated their passion for the

790
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:04,808
work that they love their work the only

791
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:08,319
thing I want to say is that the world is

792
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:11,529
waiting for you so let's lead it we are

793
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:14,558
very lucky to be here we wish to attract

794
00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:18,309
the younger ones give them information

795
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:21,930
so that they can make the best decisions

796
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:21,930
based on information

797
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:41,790
this program started as I said with

798
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:43,860
girls from secondary education the year

799
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:46,890
were they have to make the decision of

800
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:50,580
going to scientific studies or

801
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:55,049
humanities we put them in contact with

802
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:59,069
mentors and we accompany those girls in

803
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:01,530
the latest years of high school and the

804
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:04,860
first years of University so that this

805
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:09,150
talent is not lost the pilot the problem

806
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:12,780
was in Volvo's last year we had 350

807
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:17,430
requests to the program we selected 30

808
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:19,710
girls we had eight speakers of the

809
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:23,339
highest level we created a mentors

810
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:26,910
community with 60 women that this year

811
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:29,250
we are around 100 national and

812
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:32,600
international level that will be

813
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:39,120
coaching or mentoring our students and

814
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:41,069
after this pilot project in 2017 this

815
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:44,310
year and next year will be involve us by

816
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:46,920
early Cantabria and probably Madrid for

817
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:49,799
next year's we have proposals to scale

818
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:53,160
up to learn trio historias and some

819
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:57,390
other Spanish cities the impact of the

820
00:46:53,160 --> 00:47:01,290
program is that 100 percent of the girls

821
00:46:57,390 --> 00:47:03,450
that are part of the program have very

822
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:06,810
clear that they will pursue

823
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:09,480
technological studies or use technology

824
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:12,210
in their profession so and this was our

825
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,330
objective to take them towards the

826
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:18,990
digital empowerment we're talking about

827
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:21,420
the other program is the challenge

828
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:26,009
osteo robotics is a very specific

829
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:28,620
challenge to detect s/m vocations in the

830
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,400
area of mobile robotics you have to

831
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:33,450
design

832
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:41,700
build and compete with a robot in the

833
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:46,169
first edition we've been the most we had

834
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:49,470
35 teams from Spain finally they were 25

835
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:52,020
teams they were 150 the red participants

836
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:53,730
with the highest participation in Spain

837
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:56,970
we had participants from the Canary

838
00:47:53,730 --> 00:48:00,990
Islands gillece valence Madrid and it

839
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:04,250
was a great level and I urge you to go

840
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:06,509
to the website and if you feel like

841
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,190
participating and designing a robot

842
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:12,500
you're very welcome I'm just gonna show

843
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:12,500
you a video so you see how things went

844
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:23,279
today here we are in this tournament 24

845
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:27,180
teams 150 participants and 50 volunteers

846
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:30,810
in asti technology room thank you very

847
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:36,109
much for being here as the robotics was

848
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:36,110
born to develop 4.0 talent the talent

849
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:42,359
when we speak about stem talent we speak

850
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:44,400
about importance of scientific fields

851
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:48,220
our science technology engineering and

852
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,410
mathematics those are the acronyms

853
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:53,470
for stem the idea is to promote

854
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,578
vocations in this areas is public and

855
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:57,790
private collaboration

856
00:48:54,579 --> 00:49:00,790
asti deliver the project leader but we

857
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:07,569
would like to have more companies with

858
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:09,750
us thank you for this first challenge by

859
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:14,800
us the robotics with the highest

860
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:24,270
participation in ever in Spain in its

861
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:29,349
category so if you feel like

862
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:37,420
participating next year the call ends on

863
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:41,160
the 12th of January 2018 and this is the

864
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:45,510
end of my presentation the idea was to

865
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:49,149
speak about our technology technological

866
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:51,609
revolution the real problem we have in

867
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:56,109
relation to the lack of talent and if

868
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:59,560
you like it you yourselves have the

869
00:49:56,109 --> 00:50:03,130
opportunity to design your future is if

870
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:07,630
opportunity doesn't knock build a door

871
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:11,589
so you are a very important well you

872
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:15,250
should be focus and learn about all

873
00:50:11,589 --> 00:50:17,380
those initiatives implemented by in

874
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:20,200
theory or companies as Asti

875
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:23,880
so that you get to know new professions

876
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:26,259
or new professional careers

877
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,400
what I said this whole world of

878
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:34,950
opportunities without boundaries

879
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:39,730
technology examples can be many more

880
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:43,930
technology in her hands he depends on us

881
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:49,240
and without labels one of the reasons

882
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:52,770
why there aren't so many a stem students

883
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:55,689
is due to stereotypes that say that

884
00:50:52,770 --> 00:51:00,160
computer experts are fake is that there

885
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:04,630
are no women in those careers and this

886
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:08,259
is just nonsense you just have to see

887
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:12,520
what's going on what we can do what we

888
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:15,520
want and living the change we should

889
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:18,310
really look for what we like we should

890
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:21,490
feel passionate about it we should be

891
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:24,790
able to know what we really like unfocus

892
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:27,430
on our strengths our abilities and

893
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:30,340
talents always with passion with passion

894
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:32,529
and willingness luck is always there

895
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,340
generating value and looking for a

896
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:38,020
common good so with this small recipe I

897
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:41,100
sure that you will be successful thank

898
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,100
you very much for your attention

899
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:55,660
yeah I'm not gonna sign out the window

900
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:56,980
if you have any question when of course

901
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:04,078
not a peninsula here's a table

902
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:04,079
thank you so much for your attention see

903
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:13,660
Cipriano sobre el desafío the question

904
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:18,549
is about this time robotics talent how

905
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:22,779
this current system works all the tests

906
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:25,390
there are different attempts or steps

907
00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:28,089
and therefore the score depends on

908
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:31,479
whether you have finished all the tests

909
00:52:28,089 --> 00:52:35,979
and as fast as possible so depending on

910
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:40,979
the score you have obtaining everything

911
00:52:35,979 --> 00:52:44,710
adds up and at the end those that have

912
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:46,839
been successful in most of the tests and

913
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:55,440
as fast as possible there will be the

914
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:59,589
winners the registration will be open

915
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,890
until January the 12th you can register

916
00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:05,680
at the website as a team and present an

917
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:08,499
idea from then on and you do a

918
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:13,660
presentation video with this video we

919
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:17,529
give you a Raspberry Pi so that you

920
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:23,649
design the robot you have to present a

921
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:26,920
prototype and with this prototype we do

922
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:30,099
a first threshold and depending on all

923
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:33,069
designs we see those that are better

924
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:34,539
equipped they can go to the next step

925
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:39,460
the second and the third is the

926
00:53:34,539 --> 00:53:41,440
prototype so when presenting the

927
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,869
prototype you should also produce a

928
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:48,059
video you have to send the video we will

929
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:52,509
see the real progress of your design

930
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:55,239
once you have concluded this part we

931
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:59,200
decided 25 teams that will go to the

932
00:53:55,239 --> 00:54:03,249
finals and then they compete in what we

933
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,149
call the final challenge any other

934
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:09,330
question

935
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:11,490
mrs. main can you hear me yes just to

936
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:13,440
congratulate you for all the initiatives

937
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:16,080
but I have a question

938
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:20,510
we discussed it at lunch time you say

939
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,509
that your company promotes

940
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,950
entrepreneurship spirit do you devote

941
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:31,470
full time to those initiatives or

942
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:34,640
part-time when I started in Asti at the

943
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:39,629
marketing and communication department

944
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:42,720
to carry out digital marketing but quite

945
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:46,890
soon I became involved in tried in

946
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,959
talent projects and once all pilot

947
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:51,060
projects were tested we had to launch

948
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,390
them and I took them to other cities

949
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:59,870
this is a full-time job that requires

950
00:54:54,390 --> 00:55:03,779
many hours and the company could not

951
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:06,210
face this this game outside the

952
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,460
company's business as a parallel project

953
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:11,610
and Roberto and myself were the talented

954
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,850
team and we implemented as if it was our

955
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:19,920
own company who will control everything

956
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:23,250
and something else the video the PS a

957
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,260
factory is it a public video is it in

958
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,660
YouTube I think so yes I think it's in

959
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:30,990
YouTube you know that I come from below

960
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:33,660
my family works at a PC a factory in

961
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:38,520
bigger one of the largest in the world

962
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:42,390
and he's not very similar this one is in

963
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:44,880
France 8,000 people working in Vigo so

964
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:47,819
we won't have time now for the

965
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:53,010
discussion forum I said taxation versus

966
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:56,940
man on work aromatize processes are

967
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:59,670
those in which a person would not add

968
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:03,210
value they are internal logistics

969
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:04,890
processes a person does not add value

970
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:06,900
just taking a box and moving it

971
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:09,299
somewhere else if you speak about a case

972
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:13,350
a box house

973
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:17,370
the plane so we make automatic those

974
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:20,160
logistic processes that do not add value

975
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:24,980
to the final product and consumers do

976
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:30,390
not pay more for them so our customers

977
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:34,230
will have less cost we design efficient

978
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:36,750
flows so that they can save money at a

979
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:40,280
stage of the productive process that

980
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:41,610
does not add value this becomes

981
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:47,070
automatic

982
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:48,990
and then this requires other qualified

983
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:52,490
jobs that have to be supervised by

984
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:56,310
humans so we generate some other jobs

985
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:58,819
but we can ask Youmans provide more

986
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,820
volume

987
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,940
any further questions that's not the

988
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:09,330
case you're free to go

989
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:11,250
go enjoy the cyber Kamp show and thank

990
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:15,319
you very much for your attention I hope

991
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:15,320
you found my present
