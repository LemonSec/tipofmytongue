1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,450
but not when is that I suppose body my

2
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,090
name is Jorge Lanka my colleague is on

3
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:32,580
the first row he doesn't want to come up

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:37,200
here so let's make it do presentation

5
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:42,150
the mobile kills the smart card it's

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,280
Alberto's idea he choose this title to

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:47,100
make it more catchy we go back to the

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,900
eighties when the radio kills the radio

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,090
star what we can want to do with this

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,310
workshop is to make an introduction to

11
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,489
the smart card I'm gonna ask you a

12
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:04,050
question you know what is this Mart card

13
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:07,200
but now the second question how many of

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,770
you have paid today with your credit

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,380
card how many of you have used the bus

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,580
how many of you have used to your ID

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,250
card just to show it to someone

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,860
unfortunately very few people use it how

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,440
many of you you can have Apple pay I've

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,830
paid with your mobile how many of you

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,158
have Android have paid with your mobile

22
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:36,150
I'm sure that more than one person here

23
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,970
would say yes I've paid with that well

24
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,650
all this that we've done and this thing

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:46,650
that we have in our what is these are

26
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:48,600
smart cards it's the technology that we

27
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:56,580
will explain in this presentation this

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:58,798
is more plastic square was read by

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,590
readers now we just touch it touch them

30
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,580
this is about representation

31
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:06,689
understanding how this technology works

32
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:12,090
how ok we can communicate with it and

33
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:15,120
last but not least you see what happens

34
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:19,320
with her Apple pay Samsung pay and all

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,019
these options for mobile payments and to

36
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,870
use your mobile for most of transactions

37
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:28,110
that you do during the day that's the

38
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,540
trend that's the future what things that

39
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,129
we can do with our smart cards it

40
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,879
it's something that we can migrate to a

41
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:39,000
mobile phone that's the reason for the

42
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:42,450
title but we're not going to teach you

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,989
how to hack we're not going to generate

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,929
malware no this is just an introductory

45
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:50,970
talk to know how to exploit the

46
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,459
functionalities of a technology that we

47
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,980
use daily and most of us we don't even

48
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,629
know how it works from the technology

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:02,159
point of view I think it's interesting

50
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:08,459
to know more this is the idea behind my

51
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:13,138
presentation there's been hacking in

52
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:17,280
those smart cards and everything comes

53
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:19,560
from our wallet so especially its

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,970
problems for the bank's because they

55
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,900
have to pay for any security breaches so

56
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:34,500
security problems are easily detected

57
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:36,720
when we talk about payment so my

58
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,440
intention when we thought about this

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,540
workshop and seen the the room and the

60
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,349
people I brought material here so that

61
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:50,638
people who had has that these are her

62
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:53,418
own PC or computer we can do it here how

63
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,120
to send a command to a card how to read

64
00:03:53,419 --> 00:04:00,629
with a card with a mobile I wanted to do

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,819
I want to do something more manual but

66
00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:07,709
due to the layout of this room we can't

67
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:12,268
do it fine presentation is divided into

68
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:15,000
these points we have almost two hours I

69
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:18,930
hope I will have time for everything

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,729
I just love talking and sometimes such

71
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,229
as diverge we'll see say who we are in

72
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:29,580
it then an introduction to the smart

73
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:32,729
card what are the main features then

74
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,680
we'll see basic concepts of cards what

75
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,669
is the internal architecture what we

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,380
have in our

77
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,950
trousers is a small computer what type

78
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,830
of cards how they work in various

79
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,500
modalities come with contacts or

80
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:53,180
contactless you will see the security in

81
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,890
cards why those intelligent of smart

82
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,320
cards I was so robust what are the

83
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,990
implications and last but not least

84
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:04,760
we'll talk about mobile technology our

85
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:09,770
mobile phones will remove the use of

86
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:15,080
cuts marketing industry workers credit

87
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:19,400
cards removed their money and coins and

88
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:22,669
now the mobiles are going to kill the

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,039
smart cards that's a final question we'd

90
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,920
like to open a debate interesting here

91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,690
who are we

92
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:35,230
Alberto and myself were two teachers and

93
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,230
researchers for in university

94
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:46,340
researchers and then we are teachers the

95
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:50,690
telematic technology group in at the

96
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,789
university of canterbury are here we are

97
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:56,150
work also in the university master's

98
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:59,240
program and in research we work on the

99
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:03,979
Internet of Things wireless networks

100
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:06,560
network planning planning Frankie etc we

101
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:11,540
do something in security and then this

102
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:14,570
is the part of smart cards and you may

103
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:21,560
say why this guys started to work with

104
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:27,380
smart cards in the year 1995 I started

105
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:32,740
to work in university just an oldie now

106
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:35,120
in 95 the university of canterbury are

107
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:39,860
one to the system to identify the

108
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,730
students with security in the past we

109
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,730
had a different system

110
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,859
in some of the universities in Spain

111
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,949
there was a specific system what would

112
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:55,030
they we we had a piece of paper with a

113
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:57,870
photo with a name and then as a stamp

114
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,030
that was it

115
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:07,120
there's no security there I always

116
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:09,280
remember that I had a transportation

117
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,340
grant and it was just a piece of

118
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,919
cardboard you could replace your photo

119
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,630
with a photo of a colleague and the

120
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:21,340
colleague was called horican there was

121
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:28,259
no problem that the driver wouldn't mind

122
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:32,799
it so it was easy to have fake cards but

123
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:37,360
you could replace your face with another

124
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:43,500
face and so you could save a lot of

125
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:48,430
money in buses this happened - to poke

126
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:51,070
the gym or so people in the in the

127
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,909
university the managers realized that

128
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:57,520
this was no security we need more

129
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:59,530
something more robust to guarantee that

130
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,990
things are going to do be done properly

131
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:08,109
so they spoke with this Banco de

132
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:11,139
Santander his bank in Santander that has

133
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:17,380
a program called Santander universities

134
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:20,110
which tries to help universities to

135
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,349
provide specific purposes in this case

136
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,220
our director told the people in the bank

137
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:29,469
we want to have a most secure platform

138
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:33,550
and there was a university in Europe in

139
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,589
louvain in Belgium and the director said

140
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,620
I want that type of card they have the

141
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:42,120
Belgians so the people in the bank gave

142
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:46,410
us this card this card was ok it works

143
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,540
easily it wasn't easy to hack

144
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,860
we realized that the services that we

145
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,230
could offer whether card weren't you

146
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,930
know we wanted to have something more in

147
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,580
the cart that's why when we started to

148
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:03,150
work there in the year 2000 there was a

149
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:05,910
task force and these are the logos was

150
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:09,079
orange that wasn't really present at the

151
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:12,120
time but then the way that change

152
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,480
acquisitions and mergers orange did

153
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,220
appear we had a team made composer of

154
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,780
the banco santander the university of

155
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:24,210
Cantabria gemalto leader in distribution

156
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:28,380
and manufacturing of smart cards and for

157
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:33,360
safety - and orange so where did you

158
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:36,180
generate have a team and it's called the

159
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:41,880
technology Observatory of the smart card

160
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:43,829
in university a long name kkeok that's

161
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,780
the name we wanted to explore the

162
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,690
various possibilities of smart cards

163
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:52,949
first within in university and then why

164
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:55,650
not use it for other purposes what did

165
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,290
we want to improve the functionalities

166
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,819
of innovate our university cards we

167
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,880
wanted to give it more flexibility and

168
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,710
dynamism in the content I had a card

169
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,200
with my date I couldn't do anything else

170
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,370
with it we wanted to include something

171
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,190
more I could customize my data as a

172
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,320
student using the same platform as other

173
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,770
people in other universities they could

174
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:25,200
have a customized card according to your

175
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:27,060
University and to to have more usages if

176
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,730
I customized it I could include more

177
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,750
applications in this card so we wanted

178
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,140
to give life to our card that's what we

179
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,750
did

180
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,120
here you see all the services that this

181
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,970
card had in a single card these are

182
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,740
external and internal applications in

183
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:49,710
the card this card cannot have just one

184
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,980
type of application card can contain

185
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:55,560
many applications the same as we have in

186
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,900
our computers or my papaya I can go to

187
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,520
the store and download an application it

188
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,939
can do the same with a card but I don't

189
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,889
have to

190
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:06,629
or for the moment I'd like to have that

191
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:10,439
in University I don't have a store with

192
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:14,909
applications but I may have applications

193
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:20,039
inside the car that I can use that's the

194
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:23,909
reason why not many people in the world

195
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:26,220
of work with smart cards in Spain with

196
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,909
the exception of people in no Gemalto or

197
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,189
JIT

198
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:34,229
over tor these are manufacturers or CN

199
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:38,929
meaty for an ID card this ID card in at

200
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:44,929
national level is very powerful 3 3 . oh

201
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:44,929
we should use this digital ID card

202
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:56,459
it's full of applications so your ID

203
00:11:51,349 --> 00:11:57,839
card is expensive because you can do a

204
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:01,018
lot of things with it and nobody does

205
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,789
anything with the ID card let's see the

206
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,569
functionalities of these cards so that

207
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:10,999
we can start using them so I always

208
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:16,498
start with this

209
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:18,419
it's my wallet as you can see it's kind

210
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:21,839
of a brick more than a wallet this is a

211
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:25,228
part but lately I don't want to take all

212
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,869
this I have another card set in my

213
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:30,689
pocket with lots of papers these are the

214
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:32,249
ones I use in my daily life I play with

215
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:33,179
these this is university card another

216
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:36,359
for payment

217
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:42,470
another one for the gym then I have the

218
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:45,769
boss card etc these series of cards well

219
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,949
that's what you have in your pockets too

220
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:54,479
and I'm sure I'm right what do you think

221
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:58,618
I'm not a magician I'm not a magician

222
00:12:54,479 --> 00:13:02,429
but if I could do this Wow all these

223
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:04,519
cards we can have him all in just one

224
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:07,819
card would you buy my idea

225
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,819
of course

226
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,980
technology allows for that in a single

227
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,110
card all these cards could be in just

228
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,380
wonderful in a single one all these

229
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,360
cards should be moved to my mobile this

230
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,490
is allowed by technology why don't we do

231
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,640
it I don't know it's always the same

232
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:33,420
commercial interests many people around

233
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:37,620
many businesses and I I always make in

234
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,269
publicity I have American Express card

235
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,660
and people know it's an American Express

236
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:45,450
either have a visa people say oh he's

237
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,279
got a visa golden visa it's called money

238
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,940
because I have a golden this is kind of

239
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:54,899
golden visit it's not a normal visa so

240
00:13:50,940 --> 00:14:00,149
it's about image marketing in a mobile

241
00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:03,269
phone you can't really see it a mobile

242
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:06,380
is a mobile I've never seen a mobile

243
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:09,089
when I want to pay just an example

244
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:12,480
it's a Santander bank because we are

245
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:15,440
here and part of our funding comes from

246
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:21,089
you there when I pay with my card walk

247
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:24,000
my Apple or my iPhone is not read it

248
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:29,130
doesn't it doesn't turn red because I

249
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,339
pay with my Santander credit card so we

250
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:35,040
have all these cards in our pocket but

251
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:41,100
these cards can be inserted in just one

252
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:42,810
device in what we would like to do is

253
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,230
that well the more cards you have the

254
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:51,779
better Wow all these gods people would

255
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:54,540
say he's rich because he's got 20,000

256
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:58,230
cars well I'm not rich I'm not poor so

257
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,510
half of my cards are useless in fact I

258
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,320
have many operations in various banks

259
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:06,689
and all of these companies and banks

260
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,959
wanted to give you a card if I had just

261
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:13,290
one I would be happy but when I lose my

262
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:16,050
wallet what happens I have to go and

263
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:17,939
call everyone to get a new card if I had

264
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,029
just everything in just one single

265
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,010
device if my content was Center

266
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,680
I will call just one single number say

267
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:28,920
in my card has been lost with everything

268
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,079
inside please send me another card the

269
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:37,410
identical card so I would save time

270
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:44,880
money - standing stat what I'm telling

271
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:47,040
you about here may sound like utopia but

272
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,740
technology allows you to do it but you

273
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,279
need the systems so that they operate

274
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,920
properly ok the cards that I've shown

275
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,329
you basically on the outside they just

276
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:03,260
look like they have different colors

277
00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:05,670
that's all you can see although

278
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,970
externally they might be green the red

279
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:12,649
the can't Umbreon university ones green

280
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:15,810
and I've got the bus card here as well

281
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:18,360
this God doesn't have anything doesn't

282
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,160
have a contact strip or anything it's

283
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:25,920
just a grey sort of God you might say to

284
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:29,100
me well you should have thought when you

285
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,990
got in the bus you put the card near

286
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,930
somebody so that a reader can read it

287
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,970
and when you're going to pop pay those

288
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:39,510
cards that you have in your pockets have

289
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:42,570
some contacts a chip like a gold colored

290
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:46,470
chip you put it in something somebody

291
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:48,630
touches it when you used to swipe it in

292
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,100
the past and there you need to see that

293
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:56,610
although externally they're very similar

294
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:58,529
something makes you that when you go to

295
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,970
the bus you just have to touch it onto

296
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:01,290
the reader but if you're going to pay

297
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,640
for something have to put it into it

298
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:08,730
that means that different technologies

299
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:11,220
used by the cards are different so they

300
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,720
have the security measures so that you

301
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,510
can't copy them there's some of them

302
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,049
have Holograms but inside they've got an

303
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,400
antenna

304
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:23,760
I've got a micro chip some have gruff

305
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,620
some have a storage ability which is

306
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,850
what means we can use them in different

307
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:31,500
ways what's behind all of this I've said

308
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,879
to you that they're all different so now

309
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,820
let's look at how

310
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,520
the first cards evolved to the most

311
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:44,159
recent ones the first cards that we used

312
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:47,220
remember them that a magnetic strip all

313
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:52,039
started had a typical banking card with

314
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:54,870
a magnetic strip then we got chips but

315
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:59,179
why did we get this magnetic strip of

316
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:02,489
cards this technology this just really

317
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:07,710
like a strip on this typical VHS

318
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:09,929
cassettes VHS videocassettes or the ones

319
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,770
that you had on tape recorders that you

320
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:15,450
put a borrow into rewind them before we

321
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,450
had mobiles or anything like that

322
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,610
these magnetic strips are basically on

323
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:24,570
these cards the same sort of thing as

324
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:26,039
you get in a tape player these are the

325
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,649
old video tape

326
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,419
I just saw just with their reader you

327
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,669
could read the information that's

328
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:35,010
contained within it what happened with

329
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:37,770
these cards they're not smart they're

330
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:46,830
just data storage devices and have

331
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:49,500
limited data on them so what happens

332
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,350
here there was something it needs to be

333
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,929
improved and harder to happen what

334
00:18:52,350 --> 00:19:00,959
happened because a gentleman here in the

335
00:18:54,929 --> 00:19:04,890
u.s. called mark McNamara went to pay he

336
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,830
was a very wealthy guy and he went to a

337
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:11,520
bar or a restaurant or some great place

338
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:16,020
to said I want to pay and I said oh no I

339
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,400
didn't have any cash and the imagine if

340
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,200
it happens to you and we're not very

341
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,570
wealthy but imagine if it's some of this

342
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,720
gotten thousands of millions of dollars

343
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:27,139
and he says he can't pay and suddenly

344
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,000
thought I've got to have something that

345
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,850
identifies me as a person that's got

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,429
money so that I can pay that's when card

347
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,770
started that's when the magnetic strip

348
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:42,090
was I did the magnetic strip initially

349
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:44,000
had just information about the person

350
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:48,530
but they're so easy

351
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:54,770
to fake that they security layers of

352
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:56,899
what I did but there's a problem we

353
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:59,810
could still carry on copying these carts

354
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:02,060
carrying pumping them and if you can

355
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,909
copy something you could probably reuse

356
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:08,690
it do you think that the information of

357
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:12,020
the people done it I've got a pin

358
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:16,610
anchored into the cards no no no no no

359
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:20,180
no the pins not clear in the card but

360
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:25,120
it's encrypted so that people don't know

361
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:25,120
the pin if you read the magnetic strip

362
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:34,400
so remember that the pin isn't in the

363
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:36,590
magnetic strip but if the card which has

364
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,060
a magnetic strip which is not smart but

365
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:43,250
actually done when that card carries up

366
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:47,530
the transaction it's not able to

367
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,930
identify the person that's doing the

368
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,580
transaction in the past if I went to a

369
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:56,840
cash machine I put my card in the cash

370
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:59,780
machine the cash machine could read the

371
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,909
card and so if I type my pin in that's

372
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,820
okay they say that okay that's the card

373
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:09,440
belongs to this gentleman but do we know

374
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:11,300
that did we know the cash machine was

375
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,340
the cash machine that we thought it was

376
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,460
there was no way for the car to check

377
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:18,620
the cash machine we you think if you go

378
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,850
to the cash machine with a car do you

379
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,989
think you're going to the bank and all

380
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,770
those things you've seen on the

381
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:27,500
television of people who have taken

382
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:32,060
money out with copied cards that's

383
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,980
because the card doesn't identify the

384
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:37,730
cash machine

385
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:40,730
and that's where the things so just when

386
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:43,310
I say to remember the pin number I don't

387
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:46,400
know if you've noticed that you say many

388
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:49,610
magnetic strips have been copied and of

389
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,730
all the problems for security for

390
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:55,879
there's always a security camera in the

391
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,920
middle of it they see somebody sees you

392
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,380
typing your PIN so they say oh no cover

393
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,380
your hands they can't people sit as the

394
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:07,130
pins not clearly in the card even if

395
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:09,920
they cop a copy your magnetic strip they

396
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:15,230
still need to rob you to have your PIN

397
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:19,700
number that's why this way of getting

398
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:23,870
money out of cash point comes in this

399
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:26,450
way these programs that record but

400
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,810
that's because the card isn't able to

401
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,530
identify the cash mean if the card can

402
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:36,020
identify the cash machine the card would

403
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,540
have able to detect that the cash

404
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,520
machine had been modified and they would

405
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,780
reject the operation so automatically

406
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,840
they check each other and reject the

407
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,639
operation that's where the new thing

408
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,110
comes along that we need and this new

409
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:54,640
thing that we need it's a smart card

410
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:56,810
okay you've seen the evolution so far I

411
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,880
don't want to talk about protocols I'm

412
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:07,070
trying to make it easy to understand

413
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:10,040
that so we've got time what's a smart

414
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:12,230
card I define it as the following

415
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,700
there's probably more technical

416
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,760
divisions but what is is a bit of

417
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,370
plastic usually this plastic has an

418
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:23,840
embedded chip and this embedded chip

419
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:25,489
gives the card smartness or not because

420
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,419
it may be an embedded chip that isn't

421
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:34,310
smart what's this chip look like well

422
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:37,760
the chip follows the architecture of von

423
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:40,210
Neumann machine it has a CPU it has a

424
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:47,809
raw memory

425
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:49,549
and then a ram memory another one with

426
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:52,100
just a bit like a hard-disk

427
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:55,160
that's what the card is that's what the

428
00:23:52,100 --> 00:24:02,178
architecture of a smart chip is and many

429
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:04,460
of you I'm sure you've opened the

430
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:06,860
computer of your house and everything

431
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,110
that I'm telling to you is what you've

432
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,360
got in your computers all you need is

433
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:14,240
some kind of a ventilator or some kind

434
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,729
of a light to make it look like a

435
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,870
computer but that's what it is if you

436
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,210
look it's exactly the same as what

437
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,750
you've got in a computer what else do

438
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,000
you need

439
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,760
you got a microchip you've got memory

440
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,540
and then you need some an input and

441
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,390
output interfaces which on a computer

442
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,580
today are screens and keyboards and

443
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:38,360
anything else that you can put up there

444
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:42,230
other other kinds of things so here the

445
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:44,629
inputs and output interfaces these

446
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,690
yellow contacts I'll show you a couple

447
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:52,370
of photos of them below them it's where

448
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:55,340
you've got the microchip and when I put

449
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:59,799
the card into a reader the reader is

450
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:03,340
able to send signals and a feed the card

451
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:06,379
because these cards don't have a battery

452
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,330
you can plug your computer in but these

453
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,740
don't have batteries and there's another

454
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:14,449
kind of cart who instead of having chips

455
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:17,570
what they have is a little antenna and

456
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:21,530
there's something what it does is it has

457
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:23,840
some readers that send these wireless

458
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,559
sounds and some people say you know they

459
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,899
produce cancer or they don't or whatever

460
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:34,220
but they're very low pretty low power

461
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:38,799
it's not like their mobiles but anyway

462
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:41,179
the thing is there's some readers that

463
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,370
induce a current and this current

464
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:47,600
induced within the card is sufficient

465
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:49,889
not just to feed it but also to send

466
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:55,990
data to it so

467
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:58,450
this signal is sent not just this is

468
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:01,900
just a feed it but it it gives it data

469
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:07,870
so you've got contactless and contact

470
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:11,890
data and so what somebody actually had

471
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:14,050
the great idea of joining both things

472
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,970
the both of them together if you look at

473
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:18,070
your banking cards you'll have some

474
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:21,940
little icons would you like little

475
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:25,720
antennae but you've also got the

476
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:28,600
contacts so you can have a contactless

477
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:32,740
payment and other not but you can use it

478
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:35,590
both and both interfaces are accepting

479
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:38,350
the set accessing the same microchip the

480
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,540
same memory in the same way to give you

481
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:44,050
a comparison the oldest of you in the

482
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,810
room I don't know the previous speakers

483
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:50,649
and what his name was but when he showed

484
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:55,480
these computers from university this

485
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:57,760
friend of his this friend of his none of

486
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,400
these things of these computers were the

487
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,990
ones that we used when I started out

488
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,780
working here these are the ones that are

489
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:11,080
used and there you can see that these

490
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:15,879
computers like the Commodore c64 in the

491
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:18,189
IBM VM 5/100 the functions offered by

492
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,770
these computers are actually far more

493
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:23,200
limited than the smart card that you

494
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:26,500
have today so just gives you an idea of

495
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:31,630
the technological development that the

496
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:34,810
world has undergone what I find a fun

497
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:37,120
when I had my spectrum and I spent 10 to

498
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,340
15 minutes trying to get into a game and

499
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,760
all the noise that that made in the end

500
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,020
of the day the game fell apart you

501
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,270
youngsters haven't seen that and there

502
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,030
sometimes it's worthwhile looking back

503
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:52,900
in time to understand why we are where

504
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:56,920
we are today when I teach at university

505
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,990
I always like youngsters to see the old

506
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,040
side of things because they're gonna if

507
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:04,670
they see the old things they'll see

508
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:08,389
how far we've advanced wireless

509
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:09,920
technology what what was the first thing

510
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,230
that you did when you came here today

511
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:16,160
you asked for the wireless password when

512
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:18,320
I started in IT there was no internet

513
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,090
what the internet that existed when it

514
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,919
arrived was really expensive there

515
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,330
wasn't there were no mobile phones and

516
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,070
if you had a mobile phone you with the

517
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:30,050
greatest of the great and now everybody

518
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:32,659
has a mobile phone so a little bit of

519
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:35,210
this workshop is educational and it's

520
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,900
important to understand because we've

521
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:41,060
understood how technological technology

522
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,920
has evolved but youngsters today take

523
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,409
technology is something that's normal

524
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:49,310
and they do things without thinking

525
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:52,370
about them and I think some people have

526
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:55,600
already heard me said this be careful

527
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:57,620
what you upload onto Facebook or Twitter

528
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,179
don't think just because everybody else

529
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:06,889
does it it doesn't matter if you raise

530
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:09,620
your hand if you actually read the terms

531
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:12,890
and conditions when you access Gmail or

532
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,629
Twitter nobody ever raises their hand

533
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:17,480
nobody ever reads these terms and

534
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:22,690
conditions so I'm a bit of a widow

535
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:27,110
because I always bring read them anyway

536
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:28,790
there you see how we've evolved in to

537
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,520
such an extent that now our cards have

538
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,950
more capacity than the initial computers

539
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,230
so it's got a CPU processes for

540
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,680
communication interfaces memory and what

541
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:43,790
does it offer us is a adaptable dynamic

542
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,710
flexible it's easy to use I mean how do

543
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:48,470
you know who oh he doesn't know how to

544
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:52,900
use a a banking card honestly for

545
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:57,050
goodness sakes okay so it's easy to use

546
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:59,300
it's good performance when we go and pay

547
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:03,550
for the bar so you use the underground

548
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,780
or you carry out an operation it seems

549
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,600
instantaneous I mean it does things

550
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:12,200
really quickly and what about the cost

551
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,418
is fee for you it's free because the

552
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,710
bank doesn't charge you for having this

553
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:21,049
card maybe they trust you 15 euros if

554
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,419
you're if you you're overdrawn but

555
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:26,418
normally it's free and if you the one on

556
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:31,149
the bus maybe it's a euro whatever but

557
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:34,009
it's very very attractive and also it

558
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:36,619
follows a series of standards virtually

559
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:38,029
all cards are standardized in the way

560
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:40,369
they operate and it's important because

561
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:42,919
we took a look at about security but the

562
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:45,918
fact that they meet standards that means

563
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:47,899
that it's much easier to keep these

564
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,389
systems securities because if a standard

565
00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:52,279
breaks the standard that's broken if

566
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:53,809
lots of people are using it you'll find

567
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,090
a solution and somebody who realize that

568
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:58,850
and publish it or that's their intention

569
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:01,158
but if I've got proprietary systems

570
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:04,850
they're mine and you could publish them

571
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:09,080
or not yesterday oh yeah day before

572
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:12,529
yesterday I heard about the route to

573
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:15,109
access apples but the same with the

574
00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:17,269
operating system of Windows with the

575
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:19,070
Apple operating system we don't know

576
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:22,249
what's happened but if we use standard

577
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:25,480
systems where everybody have them the

578
00:31:22,249 --> 00:31:28,669
most logical thing was that somebody

579
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,249
would have given the solution to solve

580
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:33,259
it that's why I say a lot of the

581
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:36,590
standards are there because I think it's

582
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:39,019
a very important part of your hearts so

583
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:42,230
I've given you the characteristics we've

584
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:43,759
got contact cards and contact less cards

585
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,159
it's a piece of plastic with a microchip

586
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:50,570
in it let's have a look at a photo of a

587
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:54,080
card that's what a card looks like it's

588
00:31:50,570 --> 00:32:00,399
an x-ray of a card I didn't do the x-ray

589
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:01,879
and the other one is the x-ray of a

590
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,008
contact the Canterbury University

591
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:06,699
actually of any University around the

592
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:10,190
world because they're standardized

593
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:13,159
systems their functionalities that can

594
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:17,119
be used and there are lots and lots of

595
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:19,669
places where you can use it it's the

596
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:22,779
same university card that you can use

597
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:22,779
anywhere around the world

598
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:32,990
and what's more we're lucky that much of

599
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:36,850
the development of these cards came from

600
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,850
this University so there you put it I

601
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:48,470
need two laser pointers but here you can

602
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:50,899
see the chip and the thing is you can't

603
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:52,700
see what's below the chip believe me

604
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:57,560
there and there you see their antennas

605
00:32:52,700 --> 00:33:00,620
and on the right on the right you can

606
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,330
see one which has got an antenna all the

607
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:08,060
way around the card that's a university

608
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:09,800
card on the left you've got a card we

609
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,210
just test the antenna in the middle of

610
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,710
it there you can see where it says

611
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:19,340
maestro so it's a payment card of course

612
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:21,020
why in one case do you have the antenna

613
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,020
all the way around than the other just

614
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:27,950
in the middle maybe I'll give you the

615
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:31,280
replies if you look when you pick up a

616
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:33,230
credit card it's gotta know I can't

617
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,850
it'll have a name on it sort of I'm

618
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:40,040
bossed on it imagine but you they

619
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:43,159
embossed it on top of the antenna that

620
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:47,870
would really destroy the antenna so in

621
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:49,880
these cases today what they've done and

622
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,610
this is all standardized as to where you

623
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:56,660
put it they only have the antenna in

624
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:58,100
that part of the card so as not to get

625
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,640
it destroyed when somebody embosses your

626
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,490
name on it

627
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:05,260
however the University one and this is

628
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:07,690
mine here a university won this card

629
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:11,510
it's completely flat

630
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:19,270
they just screen print my name and they

631
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:19,270
don't need this some raised embossed

632
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:37,029
some people saying to me

633
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:43,720
what's this these people things are

634
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:45,910
evolved a lot but anyway this card is

635
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:49,509
not gonna be used it doesn't need to be

636
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:53,049
embossed so it hey it's suckin it's a

637
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:58,140
printer that's specially for cards but

638
00:34:53,050 --> 00:35:01,630
just on a piece of paper as you can see

639
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:04,960
next to the chips where the contacts are

640
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:07,720
you can see there's some black dots or

641
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,740
an area which is a little whiter that's

642
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:16,390
where the chip joins the antenna so the

643
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:20,080
input and output interface myth meets

644
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:22,480
the chip and at the antenna so what does

645
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,600
it look like inside you can do this by

646
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:31,810
the way when one of your credit cards

647
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:33,250
expires and instead of cutting it up by

648
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,950
the way you have to cut through the chip

649
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,380
because payment informations on the chip

650
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,500
not the magnetic strip so if you cut

651
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:44,080
through the chip that so much the better

652
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:47,620
but if after having cut through the chip

653
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:51,279
or at some moment when it's expired so

654
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:53,470
you can see it if you bend it a lot to

655
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,140
pick up of the card you can unstick of

656
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:59,290
the chip and you can see how it's made

657
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,879
inside the same if you heat it you can

658
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,009
melt the plastic as at the end this is

659
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,620
just plastic you've just pulled the

660
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:07,090
plastic away and in those cards where

661
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:13,500
there's an antenna you can see what's

662
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:13,500
inside them so don't be afraid

663
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:20,790
just cut it up when it's no longer valet

664
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:25,240
or just play with it

665
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:27,130
the first carpet I had in the university

666
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,368
the first thing I did was that just

667
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:35,920
break it and pull out the chip and today

668
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:39,010
this chip 17 years later it's still

669
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:44,260
stuck to the same place which is at the

670
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:47,230
bottom of my computer screen it's I know

671
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:51,640
it's a bit weird some people put an R 2

672
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:54,640
DT D 2 Morel on their computer but I

673
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,379
have the first chip so what you need to

674
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:02,759
do if you work in the world of

675
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:04,840
technologies lose fear of it normally

676
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,790
you can find a solution to any

677
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,440
technological problems so don't be

678
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:16,150
afraid the photos at the bottom are

679
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:19,030
manufacturing environments you can go to

680
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:20,830
the national mint and i've been lucky

681
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:24,130
enough to go to the national mint i've

682
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:27,430
also gone to an assembly factory and you

683
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,710
can see how the cards are printed how

684
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,299
the chips are printed it's an experience

685
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:33,700
of somebody of them works in this world

686
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:36,250
that maybe understand many of the work

687
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,140
of many other problems because people

688
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:41,740
still talk about our duel cards

689
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,270
contactless cards people didn't see that

690
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,430
that initially didn't work and then

691
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:47,440
eventually you realized how that what

692
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,848
the problem was and why the problem was

693
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,230
just internally and that's when you

694
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:55,330
realize the work that's behind for

695
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,670
manufacturing and designing and making

696
00:37:55,330 --> 00:38:03,130
all of these I'm now gonna get a bit

697
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:04,810
more technical so that you can see what

698
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,580
I do when I get drawn to the demo if

699
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:10,420
I've got time for it here we've got a

700
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:15,190
card which is a dumb device a card is a

701
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:17,980
dumb device it's like a slave within a

702
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,960
communication that is they have no

703
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,490
batteries that means on their own right

704
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,190
they don't do anything they need some

705
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:26,759
kind of energy and to feed them you put

706
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,760
it into a reader

707
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,569
and to communicate with it what I have

708
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:35,530
is a client and a client gives it some a

709
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:36,550
command a command called a PD you I want

710
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,800
you to remember this

711
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:42,850
APD you then may well be that you're

712
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:46,000
never gonna program a card but I'm so

713
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:51,610
I'm sure somebody's picked up an Android

714
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,470
mobile and to see if you could

715
00:38:51,610 --> 00:39:02,110
communicate with the card when you read

716
00:38:53,470 --> 00:39:07,959
the IP for Windows 10 or Android you'll

717
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:11,610
see this word which says APD you it's

718
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:20,530
the application protocol data you don't

719
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:22,720
I'm not gonna go to technical if you

720
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,610
want to come to my office I'll explain

721
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,750
it to my door is only open but I'm not

722
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:31,120
gonna explain it now and if I go back to

723
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:33,130
University this summer I'll be giving a

724
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,690
course about this a little bit more

725
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:39,880
advanced done a little bit more in depth

726
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:42,250
but what you have is a headline and then

727
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,200
a series of data that are sent to the

728
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:49,320
card and the card returns data to me

729
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:54,609
sometimes all it has to do is to say

730
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:56,400
that I've done things properly and it

731
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:02,220
tells you the state of the operation

732
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:09,360
just information if any time you start

733
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:17,350
working on this when it's w1 and SW to

734
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:20,230
is in X decimal or if it's 9000 it's two

735
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,680
bytes with 90 0 so that means that what

736
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,680
you've done

737
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:33,900
it's righted there's the code that means

738
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:36,990
everything is gone fine but basically if

739
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:40,140
these systems are certified this in the

740
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:43,009
end is the message that the card returns

741
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:47,700
to us to say that everything is correct

742
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:51,660
just to give you an idea and now I'm

743
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:54,089
saying too that the card is a dumb

744
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,839
device it's a slave device it needs to

745
00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:06,030
be fed and when I feed my cart the cart

746
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:09,330
to know that it's activated the card has

747
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:12,000
to say oh I'm ready I'm ready I can now

748
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:15,569
return things so at that moment the card

749
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,960
what it does it sends a message called a

750
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:24,680
tea our answer to reset this message

751
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,390
returns information which in the end is

752
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:34,529
information about the protocols the

753
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:36,810
times and the way physically what sort

754
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,910
of protocol I should use from that

755
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:42,330
moment onwards I can start exchanging

756
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:44,549
messages that is the application sends

757
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,200
an apdu to the reader the reader goes to

758
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:52,910
the card the card collects it's within

759
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,910
the card there's this apdu processor

760
00:41:53,450 --> 00:42:01,439
which shares if if it's apdu is type one

761
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,720
i do this if it's type 3 or do this it's

762
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,330
just like a dispatcher where depending

763
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:10,140
on upon the instruction code it does one

764
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:12,150
thing or another and as a result of this

765
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:15,779
operation which is called a function or

766
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:18,330
you get the response and you get it in

767
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,600
the application and then the client will

768
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:24,190
decide what to do so the card just obeys

769
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:27,140
orders that's all it does

770
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:29,840
so what you've got is a processor a chip

771
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:32,060
it's got memory etc so let's start to

772
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,480
talk about how this chip works

773
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:37,790
what's the operating system what's the

774
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,400
features that I have within this card

775
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:44,690
this is the first idea the beaches that

776
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,180
were most used to even though I say this

777
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,980
all sorts of things can be done the

778
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,660
parts that we have in the university the

779
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,810
banking cards and technology that have

780
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:59,750
allow us I was get an example they allow

781
00:42:53,810 --> 00:43:04,490
us to you can do the zero game or the

782
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:06,890
sinking the battleship game and they've

783
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:09,950
got applications for cryptography for

784
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:13,839
example our ID numbers use a

785
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:16,520
cryptographic system with electronic

786
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:20,690
signatures it's Sara but just to give

787
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,670
you an idea of the fact that the card is

788
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,310
like a little mini computer and you can

789
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,740
program it I can program a calculator I

790
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:32,380
can program whatever I fancy it just

791
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:37,129
doesn't just steer store data in files

792
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:43,430
so if the majority of them are based

793
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:47,630
just on storing files safely these cards

794
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:49,310
are normally just mono application cards

795
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,980
but the ones that we're interested in

796
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:55,100
and the ones that we've been working on

797
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:57,320
since the year 2000 are multi

798
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,839
application cards a little bit being

799
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:04,070
more expensive but this compensates the

800
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:05,840
fact that I can do the magic trick I can

801
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:08,660
put a lot of functionalities to give you

802
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,370
an example this presentation I don't

803
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,710
want to talk about the university card

804
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:15,850
but it has identification transport

805
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:15,850
updation payments

806
00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:22,689
retain retention is electronic signature

807
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:24,549
and access control this can be a

808
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:27,549
different application within the cart

809
00:44:24,549 --> 00:44:30,279
when I click on word one or a click on

810
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:32,799
PowerPoint and there's a different

811
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:35,380
application that is opening what exactly

812
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:40,809
the same it happens in the cart unit

813
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:42,700
difference the card has know all the

814
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:45,849
threads open at the same time but they

815
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:49,029
can interact with all the applications

816
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,499
in an independent way with security the

817
00:44:49,029 --> 00:44:53,249
information in an application is going

818
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:57,459
to be seen by the other applications

819
00:44:53,249 --> 00:45:01,779
so there are firewalls between the

820
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:03,970
applications that's important if you

821
00:45:01,779 --> 00:45:06,130
could be people to do something and I

822
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:07,569
haven't a transportation application or

823
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,660
in payment application and the

824
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:13,180
transportation application is able to

825
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:17,470
take that data out of the payment

826
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:20,730
application that's that's a problem the

827
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:25,629
card certifications allow for those

828
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:28,450
security holes this is not the magic

829
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:32,230
solution but maybe it's one of the

830
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:35,710
portable save devices one of the best

831
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:40,269
that we can use in the world people

832
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:42,970
prefer to put it in a USB memory but

833
00:45:40,269 --> 00:45:46,660
it's it's me it's Seifert when using a

834
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:48,308
cloud so multi applications we are

835
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:52,118
interested by multi multiple

836
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:54,519
applications there are many operating

837
00:45:52,119 --> 00:46:00,789
systems for this some of them are based

838
00:45:54,519 --> 00:46:06,250
on net but the most evolved system it is

839
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:09,460
Java cloud Java

840
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:13,300
well it rings a bell if you know how to

841
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:16,510
program in Java in just one afternoon in

842
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:19,090
less than an afternoon if my students

843
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:27,010
have done it in two hours you can do it

844
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:30,250
two in one morning you can do it you can

845
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:34,000
make a program for a calculator or

846
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:35,680
program for an application based on the

847
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,230
card you sent two cards and one

848
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,859
operation and the car will give you the

849
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:46,599
result two plus three will have a result

850
00:46:41,859 --> 00:46:50,410
of 5 we could do that it's a calculator

851
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:53,260
but it has nothing to do with an

852
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:55,690
electronic signature system or bag

853
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:59,920
pavement or transportation something

854
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:03,780
that I just imagined a calculator now so

855
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,980
you're a demo where I do a hello world

856
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:11,080
with all the commands there's a hello

857
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:14,260
wall saying there's a virus there's a

858
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:16,210
mall with very simple programs that we

859
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,849
can include in this class this

860
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:22,900
architecture is very similar to the one

861
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:25,960
that we find in a Java system went with

862
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:28,900
Java you have the operating system and

863
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:32,589
the Java Virtual Machine on top of it

864
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:36,520
here you have the proprietary CPU from

865
00:47:32,589 --> 00:47:40,960
the X manufacturer and then the have

866
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:45,119
Java card layer that exports an API we

867
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:50,260
will upload the applications in the cart

868
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:52,839
let's think the card in itself is not

869
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:58,720
uni 7 nothing to do with that

870
00:47:52,839 --> 00:48:01,779
there's no display the hole of utilities

871
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,500
of Java code that's the a set of

872
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:08,950
functionalities of food fight each other

873
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:10,540
the virtual machine should be in just

874
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,089
one platform but in fact there are two

875
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:15,220
part of the virtual machine is the own

876
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:18,369
own card in the card and another one is

877
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:20,020
outside the card in your computer

878
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:22,270
plus the

879
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:24,550
upon compilation and bytecode generation

880
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:27,100
is done outside when the the code is

881
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:31,390
executive all then the code I put it in

882
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:33,420
the cart the cart just executes when we

883
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:40,720
do it with a normal virtual machine

884
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:43,060
there's always conversions this Java

885
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,339
code functionalities plus a

886
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:47,830
specification called global platform

887
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:51,310
allows us to unload download

888
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:56,740
applications updating that content and

889
00:48:51,310 --> 00:49:07,680
many of the things so we had a card it

890
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:12,419
was just a static device with no life so

891
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:16,149
so a no-life device that now we have a

892
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:18,730
device that is alive because we can

893
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:21,550
change the content in the cards it can

894
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:25,960
evolve I could have the University

895
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:30,700
application here instead of making new

896
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:33,220
cards I could have my card for all my

897
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:37,089
life using this technology I'm just

898
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:39,359
doing what I'm just doing upgrades well

899
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:43,840
that your ID card

900
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:47,110
we had the version 2.0 with contact now

901
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:53,100
we have contactless with upgrades we

902
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:55,420
could make an updating of the ID card a

903
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,220
Content but now they've had this

904
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,840
security hole so that's why they're

905
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:02,859
thinking about that we have public

906
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:07,030
transport payments and others it's an

907
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:09,270
animation this small squares are

908
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:12,870
different applications

909
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:15,670
we'll see what what is Mifare DESFire

910
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:18,850
calypso but in fact you using that every

911
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:24,190
day then payment EMV contact contact

912
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:26,350
lets you don't know what EMV if you when

913
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:31,220
you raise your hand saying i have paid

914
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:36,299
with this you paid with EMV

915
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:39,660
that's in the cart so I generate my

916
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,700
first car my basic card and this is the

917
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,920
multi applications philosophy this is

918
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,970
the basic card with those applications

919
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:51,720
now I'll give you the new University

920
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:56,129
example because I know it well because

921
00:50:51,720 --> 00:51:01,109
the audience is quite young because I

922
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:01,859
suppose there are students here have

923
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:04,560
this card

924
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:08,160
I'm a student in this University and I

925
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:12,090
say I go to the University of alcalá

926
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:15,450
daenerys in Madrid because one of the

927
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:17,640
speakers worth was from Alcala okay I go

928
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:20,790
to that University using the same

929
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:23,580
technology because we are in this

930
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:25,590
Santander University it's network and

931
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,779
they use the same culture so I go to

932
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:30,530
alkali University and I say oh you gave

933
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:35,010
me another car I want your applications

934
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:36,900
this card has a cost and I would have to

935
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:40,310
pay again but if I have multi

936
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:43,740
applications I can say I'll go there

937
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:46,410
because they don't use my fare for K but

938
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:48,750
they use this fire in my university I

939
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:50,520
didn't have the electronic signature in

940
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:55,590
alkali they use it so I can anything

941
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:58,859
included it's about corporate spirit

942
00:51:55,590 --> 00:52:01,730
sometimes I'm in white but sometimes I

943
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:04,020
am in red and sometimes I have the green

944
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:06,840
jackets from the University of

945
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:10,970
Canterbury I'm green I'm from this

946
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:14,280
university the Alcala has a blue card

947
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:17,990
you have a logo saying this is a valid

948
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:21,119
University card I don't mind the color

949
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:25,470
it does it's not about the color of your

950
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,210
card if you pay with your Santander

951
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:29,609
credit card they say you know it's blue

952
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:35,070
I can't accept it there is a master

953
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:37,049
MasterCard logo or American Express it's

954
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:39,720
about the layouts not about the color

955
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:44,780
color but I love my corporate spirit I

956
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:49,069
am I am from the University of Cantabria

957
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:54,780
but I always belong to a space it's here

958
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:57,750
so it's the same card and then I and I

959
00:52:54,780 --> 00:53:00,960
go to Madrid and they say they don't

960
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:08,220
know that I'm a teacher I have a card

961
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:10,200
and I'm very hardworking people late I

962
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:13,259
have to get out of the university

963
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:18,740
because I'm working late so there's a

964
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:21,119
new their application inside access

965
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:24,750
now there's an update we have an

966
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:27,060
agreement signed with the gym using this

967
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:30,720
technology and I can put it in the cart

968
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:32,640
oh yeah I say yes because I'll be in

969
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,819
Madrid for three months I love to go to

970
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:45,089
the gym so I please ask you to put my

971
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:47,160
gym application inside so I register

972
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:51,119
into the gym and I have the application

973
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:53,640
inside with the same card that are used

974
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:58,530
in Santander now I can do it in Madrid

975
00:53:53,640 --> 00:54:01,020
with zero cost I'm just updating the

976
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:05,940
applications if I had a store I could

977
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:09,990
customize my cart this is a multi

978
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:14,040
application part and now let's talk

979
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:17,220
about security is this you a secured

980
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:19,430
card yes there's nothing securing this

981
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:23,910
world so anyway

982
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:26,669
maybe the listeners or people saying I

983
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:29,819
hacked this car cause some of them are

984
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:33,720
having fights but basically these

985
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:36,900
devices are very safe they have visual

986
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:43,189
security measures sometimes we just show

987
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:43,190
it with a photo sometimes

988
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:55,150
so you can show your cars with micro

989
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:59,899
impression Holograms UV inks sometimes

990
00:54:55,150 --> 00:55:02,290
there's a signature behind the card we

991
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:06,290
should sign it but nobody does it

992
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:09,110
because we use the chip and pin we don't

993
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:15,320
sign the receipts but it would be good

994
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:19,460
to sign them somebody said that when the

995
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:23,780
magnetic strip cards were used he tried

996
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:27,770
to cheat on a supermarket

997
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:31,430
he bought a TV and he paid and when he

998
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:37,250
signed instead of signing well the

999
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:39,919
cashier never looks and sometimes it

1000
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:43,940
just show your ID well it wasn't the

1001
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,860
same signature when the charge came to

1002
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:50,390
the sperm market well the guy said I

1003
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:52,190
didn't do this purchase you did it and

1004
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:57,589
no I didn't buy it with my card

1005
00:55:52,190 --> 00:56:00,560
no what happens the cashier say show me

1006
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:02,230
the receipt and the receipt it had in

1007
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,390
the same signature

1008
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:10,010
the signature wasn't your signature so

1009
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:12,410
you didn't buy the TV but it was you

1010
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:15,410
and there's the data protection north

1011
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:21,080
and we have we were gonna have a new

1012
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:24,589
directive the data protection law is a

1013
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:28,130
new one and we can ask for our data to

1014
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:31,760
be erased so not all the places do

1015
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:35,750
implement the data protection law so the

1016
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:40,100
guy said take the video from the that

1017
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:42,460
day when I was paying at this cashier it

1018
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:46,790
was so expensive to look for that video

1019
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:52,760
in fact he had he had a free TV and he

1020
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:54,020
got the money back and you see what

1021
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,970
happens

1022
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:59,420
we're talking about malware but this

1023
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:02,970
hacking of words

1024
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:11,510
it's about cheating with Spanish and

1025
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:11,509
Latin and we are always trying to cheat

1026
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:17,550
people think like that way it's a pity

1027
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:21,960
so it's possible to hack a smart card

1028
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:26,760
yes but we need deep knowledge and big

1029
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:31,410
machines and there are additional

1030
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:33,660
problems but we need to analyze if the

1031
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,580
test modes of the cards are habilitated

1032
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:38,910
we need to make an internal analysis of

1033
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:43,049
circuits and now cards don't keep all

1034
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:44,759
the data in consecutive memory so we

1035
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:47,280
need to have a machine that allows us to

1036
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:51,450
alter the operational mode of the card

1037
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:55,590
in order to slow down the functioning

1038
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:58,020
and trying to touch this to modify it

1039
00:57:55,590 --> 00:58:00,330
it's quite difficult when you open it

1040
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:04,830
and when we inject the light well the

1041
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:08,270
card loses other data if you try to open

1042
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:11,610
it when we communicate with a card

1043
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:16,230
it's about authentic yes it's logic

1044
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:18,300
security to communicate with a card the

1045
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:19,890
card is going to implement a procedures

1046
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:23,220
through which this a mutual

1047
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:26,460
authentication need the reader and the

1048
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:28,730
car have to authenticate with specific

1049
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,730
keys

1050
00:58:32,089 --> 00:58:40,989
I think I have time apart from that

1051
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:44,089
every time there's a key this procedures

1052
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:47,209
are very common with HTTPS we're not

1053
00:58:44,089 --> 00:58:50,808
always using the same key there's a

1054
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:53,828
master key all all the sessions are not

1055
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:57,439
going to be seen normally these sessions

1056
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:59,689
last for a couple of seconds there are

1057
00:58:57,439 --> 00:59:01,279
many atomic operations or the either you

1058
00:58:59,689 --> 00:59:03,489
do everything either you don't do

1059
00:59:01,279 --> 00:59:05,689
anything you remember with the

1060
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:13,039
transportation cards in the book in the

1061
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:16,219
verses I had a colleague who was using

1062
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:19,699
his boss card and very very slowly and

1063
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:27,439
he could have more troubles than those

1064
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:30,439
that were in included in the card that's

1065
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:33,739
the philosophy of atomic operations

1066
00:59:30,439 --> 00:59:38,029
either it's done either it's not done so

1067
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:43,390
you can avoid the cheating thing so we

1068
00:59:38,029 --> 00:59:47,859
have security domains each application

1069
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:50,719
runs its own memory space sandbox where

1070
00:59:47,859 --> 00:59:51,848
everything is executed nobody can get to

1071
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:56,170
the sandbox

1072
00:59:51,849 --> 01:00:01,699
unless it's updated in the code itself

1073
00:59:56,170 --> 01:00:07,910
then there are certifications they're

1074
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:10,069
good 3:05 certifications it's broken or

1075
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:15,288
if we modify something in a cart this

1076
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:19,390
certification is canceled and the

1077
01:00:15,289 --> 01:00:21,380
manufacturer says you've modified it so

1078
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:23,660
certifications are very serious and

1079
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:28,759
there they've done well with

1080
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:32,989
laboratories so the card is secure if

1081
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:34,910
it's not if there's a problem it's their

1082
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:36,380
responsibility it's it's for the

1083
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:37,118
manufacturers and it's for the

1084
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,440
certifiers

1085
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:43,339
so

1086
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,589
it's about black box and white box there

1087
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:48,259
are operations into the car knowing what

1088
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:50,930
it has to do and in other cases it

1089
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:52,549
doesn't know what has to do we developed

1090
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,500
part of the code that was inside this

1091
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:56,089
cart

1092
01:00:53,500 --> 01:01:00,410
imagine that nobody's certifying this

1093
01:00:56,089 --> 01:01:04,490
car nor the code and I say you've seen

1094
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:07,549
the command it's heading and some data

1095
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:09,618
they taken come on a standard command

1096
01:01:07,549 --> 01:01:17,480
and inside my code they say that a

1097
01:01:09,619 --> 01:01:19,760
random chain of 256 bytes pushes a

1098
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,950
hundred euros in an electronic wallet

1099
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,280
you know that any nobody would find it

1100
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:27,038
if you there are no strong certification

1101
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:31,160
processes it's difficult to find that

1102
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:32,809
nobody's going to send the the carts

1103
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:36,950
because it's very slow it's slower than

1104
01:01:32,809 --> 01:01:40,010
a computer I can't use this system in a

1105
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:41,689
very rapid way they've 256 bytes I don't

1106
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:44,029
know how many operations we need to

1107
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:45,799
check it all but operations are done

1108
01:01:44,029 --> 01:01:49,339
according to the code that I gave its

1109
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:51,140
analyzed before that a card is put into

1110
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:54,020
the market so there is an inspection and

1111
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:57,980
I think it's quite lost inspection of

1112
01:01:54,020 --> 01:02:00,200
those features then normally the card is

1113
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,210
not used as a single device it's used as

1114
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,819
a second factor a third factor of

1115
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:07,099
authentication

1116
01:02:03,819 --> 01:02:11,930
you know identification is what I have

1117
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:14,660
and what I know and what I am so my pin

1118
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:19,069
is what I know the card is mine and then

1119
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:24,460
if you like it I'm not in favor well you

1120
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:24,460
can still use your finger on your mobile

1121
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:33,319
so I have just one print if one day I

1122
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:36,230
lose this print people say it's kept in

1123
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:44,000
a very secure way but people say it's

1124
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:47,510
safe wait I just have one finger my

1125
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,470
finger cannot be changed so today I can

1126
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:52,440
assure you that I've never used my

1127
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:55,140
finger just in the

1128
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:58,650
ID card in Spain because I just can't

1129
01:02:55,140 --> 01:03:07,259
have another choice I'm not using my

1130
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:08,780
fingerprint for the passport I use the

1131
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:15,569
fingerprint but that's all

1132
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:18,270
so there's another part here operations

1133
01:03:15,569 --> 01:03:21,839
that can be done or cancelled on the

1134
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:24,690
clouds and hardware security modules are

1135
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:26,970
based on hardware that the card is a

1136
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:31,140
portable hardware security module others

1137
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:35,459
are stored in the cloud with big amount

1138
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:38,670
of safe data are stored the problem well

1139
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:40,650
I don't need to know the algorithms or

1140
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:42,750
the cryptographic procedures this is

1141
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:46,680
implemented here if one day I need to

1142
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:48,480
change the graphic system I don't need

1143
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,060
to change the code I don't need any

1144
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:55,220
update somebody's going to update my

1145
01:03:51,060 --> 01:04:00,930
card it's it's more transparent now we

1146
01:03:55,220 --> 01:04:03,180
start the discussion it's up to you do

1147
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:05,490
you prefer to use the hard word or

1148
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:09,089
versus the software do you like security

1149
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:17,520
and to store data in hardware or in

1150
01:04:09,089 --> 01:04:20,549
software well that's your choice I won't

1151
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:24,750
have time for the demos in Hardware

1152
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:29,130
environments and the software and Varmus

1153
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:35,550
if you use your ID card me people have

1154
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:39,050
done their tax return with these

1155
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:41,640
electronic certificate it's a digital

1156
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:46,589
certificate and we kept it in our

1157
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:49,379
computer the talk that we had before

1158
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:52,890
with a malware able to see the content

1159
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:55,470
of our computers what happens I don't

1160
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:58,710
know if you know anything about private

1161
01:04:55,470 --> 01:05:01,529
and public symmetric-key our private and

1162
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:03,839
he is in our computer some somebody

1163
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:06,019
could take the certificate with a

1164
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:09,839
private key and

1165
01:05:06,019 --> 01:05:11,939
and that's the end of it one day I had

1166
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:17,190
no home no house because a person has

1167
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:19,950
used that and my digital ID is my

1168
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:22,739
private key so they used that

1169
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:25,828
information and they sold my house with

1170
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:31,079
a new ID card with her readers I didn't

1171
01:05:25,829 --> 01:05:34,499
speak about cost but when you put the

1172
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:36,029
the ID card in the reader the

1173
01:05:34,499 --> 01:05:39,058
authentication operations are done

1174
01:05:36,029 --> 01:05:42,480
within the card the private he doesn't

1175
01:05:39,059 --> 01:05:45,720
get out of here I can't I can't lose I

1176
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:50,190
can lose my private key if I lose my

1177
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:52,109
card you're able to do thorough

1178
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:53,700
inspections in the card you would be

1179
01:05:52,109 --> 01:05:56,308
able to read the content of the card

1180
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:59,189
there's a veil a security violation is

1181
01:05:56,309 --> 01:06:01,799
due to a library specific library and

1182
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:05,960
then you can obtain the private key but

1183
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:17,150
they couldn't get to the numbers really

1184
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:19,769
so when we do tax return and we use the

1185
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:22,859
the smart car we there's great

1186
01:06:19,769 --> 01:06:26,959
robustness it's sure it's a secure

1187
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:34,109
operation it was us signing those papers

1188
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:36,269
nobody else can hack our identity I was

1189
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:41,130
talking about cost what's the cost of

1190
01:06:36,269 --> 01:06:42,868
this cards the less expensive is one

1191
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:47,640
less than your new euro and the most

1192
01:06:42,869 --> 01:06:50,220
expensive 30 euros each these are market

1193
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:53,730
values and cost for one unit because

1194
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:58,529
banks by millions of cards but your bus

1195
01:06:53,730 --> 01:07:04,859
card in Santander it's a Mayfair classic

1196
01:06:58,529 --> 01:07:09,150
car you can buy it for less than 1 euro

1197
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:13,078
in eBay this card is Java card you have

1198
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:16,920
to request it and it around 20 euros a

1199
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:19,650
piece I can't give them to you because

1200
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:25,320
these guards I use them for my demos and

1201
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:26,730
workshops but you can see the the keys

1202
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:31,100
and you can start working with that you

1203
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:31,100
need a reader for that what is a reader

1204
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:46,440
this is a contactless reader this is

1205
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:49,020
another one it's quite big well you can

1206
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:53,190
use it at home but it's not possible

1207
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:57,120
look I've got this other reader with the

1208
01:07:53,190 --> 01:08:01,290
demos this is it this is this part this

1209
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:06,029
is another reader I use it with the old

1210
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:12,990
ID card this is a contact a reader I put

1211
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:17,960
my card here that's it here this is

1212
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:17,960
contactless I just approach the card

1213
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:28,800
well they're very small the cost

1214
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:33,200
I bought them recently this is 25 to 30

1215
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:37,020
euros then we have more expensive

1216
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:41,970
readers but I tell you this is the the

1217
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:45,920
most expensive read is another best it's

1218
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:48,360
not just about buying expensive devices

1219
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,920
you have to look at the market first and

1220
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:52,559
see the functionalities of each reader

1221
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,529
with this I can do operations to

1222
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:58,260
transfer data to a mobile with us the

1223
01:08:55,529 --> 01:09:00,899
one that costs 70 euros I can't do that

1224
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:03,570
much but from the aesthetic point of

1225
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:07,349
view it's beautiful I've got it in a box

1226
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:11,420
it's beautiful it's cooler but I can't

1227
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:19,230
do as many things as with the cheap and

1228
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:20,970
dry reader any questions following let's

1229
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:24,139
talk we can talk later

1230
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:27,350
and now let's talk about the other parts

1231
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:30,000
we've talked about security in the cards

1232
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:32,190
and I said I was using this card with a

1233
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,970
reader but what's being used more and

1234
01:09:32,189 --> 01:09:36,120
more is

1235
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:39,540
the the touch the the contactless

1236
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:42,510
technologies my kids when they were born

1237
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:44,490
what do they do they touch babies touch

1238
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:51,360
and nobody in everybody knows how to

1239
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:58,590
touch things oh we're not going to talk

1240
01:09:51,359 --> 01:10:00,870
about axis touching ladies I don't have

1241
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:05,430
house of cards anymore I'm so unhappy

1242
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:07,680
about that in the past we had to

1243
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:12,930
introduce and insert the car the problem

1244
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:17,370
is that contacts used to get damaged and

1245
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:20,220
you had to find the hole and now we have

1246
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:23,610
the contactless technology which is

1247
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:25,620
easier I just need to touch it and it's

1248
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:29,009
quite easy when I get to the bus

1249
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:31,650
I just approach my car from the machine

1250
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:33,870
to the machine it works sometimes I

1251
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:35,700
don't even need to get my card out of my

1252
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:38,070
wallet because it works perfectly well

1253
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:44,360
let's see how this contactless

1254
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:47,160
technologies work so we have contactless

1255
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:56,670
technologies it was created in the year

1256
01:10:47,160 --> 01:11:01,130
83 started with the RFID technology this

1257
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:06,020
technology radiofrequency technology

1258
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:08,670
worked in the 860 to 960 megahertz

1259
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:11,180
that's the frequency range depending

1260
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:14,310
depending on the countries whether

1261
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:17,640
several meters distance that's a good

1262
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:20,490
coverage with a very small memories and

1263
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,380
limited processing capacity these tags

1264
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:28,740
because in fact there were stickers or

1265
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:31,580
tags I'm always doing publicity if you

1266
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,580
go to Decathlon

1267
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:41,950
all the t-shirts or the the objects that

1268
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:46,900
you buy you put them into a box in in

1269
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:48,519
it's called attack RFID it's it sticks

1270
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:52,599
to the objects that we buy

1271
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:57,430
it's the label and now it's going to

1272
01:11:52,600 --> 01:12:00,490
replace barcodes well it's not that easy

1273
01:11:57,430 --> 01:12:03,850
as printing a piece of paper but this is

1274
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:07,710
going to replace barcodes and this is

1275
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:11,560
the dream of each supermarket customer I

1276
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:13,510
put my things in my caddy and when I go

1277
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:16,420
through the cachet I don't need to get

1278
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:21,490
the things out and the Machine says a

1279
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:23,230
hundred euros so as I'm saving time it's

1280
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:28,559
burdensome one you had to get everything

1281
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:28,559
out and everything again so it's easy

1282
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:36,130
and then you just need to approach your

1283
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:40,960
card and it will tell you the total

1284
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:42,850
amount of your bill sometimes you need

1285
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:48,130
to do many operations but here it's

1286
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:50,580
probably easier this type of labels it's

1287
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:53,860
easy then we have the proximity and

1288
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:59,110
vicinity cards with another frequency

1289
01:12:53,860 --> 01:13:01,809
range 13 dot point 56 megahertz

1290
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:04,660
when frequencies changes we can have

1291
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:10,660
more range or less range several

1292
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:13,690
millimeters is 13 point 56 megahertz so

1293
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:19,080
the distance the reading distance is

1294
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:21,490
reduced to meters to centimeters and

1295
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:24,360
that's an advantage and it's good for

1296
01:13:21,490 --> 01:13:27,870
security in contactless cards the

1297
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:33,299
reading distance is very short here the

1298
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:39,760
theoretical one meter to 1.5 meters and

1299
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:44,830
these cards are used in the ski in the

1300
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:47,350
ski stations for the fog Fair when you

1301
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:53,410
ski these are the labels

1302
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:55,570
the contactless smart cards respect the

1303
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:59,380
ISO 14443

1304
01:13:55,570 --> 01:14:03,730
a or B the theoretical reading distance

1305
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:05,830
is 15 centimeters and there's one 620

1306
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:09,070
meters and need a big reader but

1307
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:11,170
normally it's 5 centimeters what we do

1308
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:17,110
when we go into the bus we always touch

1309
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:18,880
it and normally people start to push it

1310
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:21,070
and to press it well you don't need it

1311
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:30,040
just approach it to the to the reader

1312
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:33,250
and it's okay so the only thing that you

1313
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:36,700
need to do is to get it near to the

1314
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:39,430
device and what do you do with that it

1315
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:42,809
has to be you that puts their card near

1316
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:47,050
the reader you're not putting it inside

1317
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:48,700
the machine it's not like when you use a

1318
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:51,370
Bluetooth if you've got a Bluetooth in

1319
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:54,790
your mobile if I've got that activated

1320
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:57,540
that people know that I've been here so

1321
01:14:54,790 --> 01:15:02,140
that they know that I've got this card

1322
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:06,550
you have to get near the reader and if

1323
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:08,620
not it's impossible so remember that

1324
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:10,840
it's part of the security that allows us

1325
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:16,780
to have this another part is as you've

1326
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:20,520
seen this doesn't give off a great deal

1327
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:24,190
of energy to be able to feed this card

1328
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:27,520
so these are systems that consume very

1329
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:31,960
little and that means that our batteries

1330
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:33,970
last longer they're active or passive

1331
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,670
and if it's an element passive element

1332
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:38,860
and in this case cards are dumb you

1333
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:40,630
could even manage to pay when you didn't

1334
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:43,509
have battery in your mobile with the

1335
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:46,980
systems that we have now you could do it

1336
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:46,980
with the systems that we have now

1337
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:56,349
card technologies these are just some of

1338
01:15:53,390 --> 01:16:01,310
the most well-known ones the most

1339
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:04,670
well-known one is my fair then you've

1340
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:07,880
got Mifare classic Mifare DESFire that

1341
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:09,680
have different memory capacities but

1342
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:12,610
they're standardized if you'd look in

1343
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:18,590
Internet you can find all different

1344
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:25,940
information about this for example I've

1345
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:28,100
got access to DESFire and in the one

1346
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:32,179
that I've got this fire and there's a

1347
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:36,050
watermark with my name on it and you can

1348
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:39,710
avoid filtering so the Mifare classic if

1349
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:42,949
you look for Mifare classic or Mifare

1350
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:45,170
ultralight you'll find them there's

1351
01:16:42,949 --> 01:16:51,379
something I want you to see here which

1352
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:54,530
is their their proprietary and some are

1353
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:59,660
other B type the are your ID card is a B

1354
01:16:54,530 --> 01:17:03,259
type and but when they send the a PDUs

1355
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:05,630
they still operate in the same way but

1356
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:07,730
as for the radio signal that's slightly

1357
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:09,860
different I've only got half an hour

1358
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:13,339
left so I won't go into that so we've

1359
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:15,650
got cryptography because we're talking

1360
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:19,130
here about security and you can see that

1361
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:21,980
the ultralight classic have an

1362
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,280
algorithms which says crypto can you see

1363
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:25,459
it

1364
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:29,349
crypto but deaths you've probably heard

1365
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:34,449
of desks yeah and I think it's tomorrow

1366
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:34,449
one day there's a talk about des

1367
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:48,240
so we say standard or non-standard let

1368
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:52,800
me go back again cards should follow

1369
01:17:48,240 --> 01:18:00,450
standard systems of the classic my fare

1370
01:17:52,800 --> 01:18:03,020
cards follow standards at level one and

1371
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:06,769
at level two and level three

1372
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:08,940
they don't really meet to the standard

1373
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:13,280
but when they get to level four they

1374
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:16,799
don't care and they add a different

1375
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:19,650
level of commands and then XP I'd said

1376
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:22,650
they'd also have des vise and they use a

1377
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:26,580
standard security algorithm and they

1378
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:31,009
meet one two three and four which is the

1379
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:31,010
level that APD use of traditionally sent

1380
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:38,960
if you Google or Bing or your home

1381
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:54,820
if you look in Internet you'll see

1382
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:58,309
classic My Fair securities been broken

1383
01:18:54,820 --> 01:19:01,880
violated and even so we use it virtually

1384
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:05,060
every day we pay our bus for that and

1385
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:07,430
the same we do in Canterbury they do in

1386
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:09,590
about 20 thousand million places around

1387
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:14,690
the world there lots of access control

1388
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:17,720
still use this what I mean is that it's

1389
01:19:14,690 --> 01:19:21,219
been violated and we'll see the

1390
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:24,190
consequences of this what we have to say

1391
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:26,330
is that oh you know there's a security

1392
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:31,690
failure you know how many people are

1393
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:38,110
gonna make use of this whole insecurity

1394
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:44,030
because you know it's not like a Trojan

1395
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:46,400
this case people to do this I can have a

1396
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:48,349
certain kind of technical

1397
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:51,860
characteristics it's a device that you

1398
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:53,090
have to have they're gonna try and sell

1399
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:55,219
you cards that will allow you to access

1400
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:57,380
to god-knows-where but the devices that

1401
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:58,670
are in the cards that can also be

1402
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:01,370
connected to internet and the other

1403
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:04,280
thing I didn't say which I forgot is

1404
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:07,640
that cards normal normally have a unique

1405
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:10,280
identifier and I can't rewrite it it's

1406
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:13,600
written from factory it's printed on the

1407
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:18,080
chip so there's a part that you can't

1408
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:20,180
hack so if I'm do a game with whitelists

1409
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:22,340
and blacklists even though the security

1410
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:29,500
algorithms been broken if there's

1411
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:29,500
somebody trying to prevent my bus pass

1412
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:37,070
amount not going down you can always get

1413
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:42,710
it to be constant but when they check

1414
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:44,990
their balance to see that the balance of

1415
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:50,389
this gentleman is always the same and

1416
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:56,989
they're always travelling on the bus

1417
01:20:50,389 --> 01:20:58,909
the intelligence environments will

1418
01:20:56,989 --> 01:21:00,739
detect that there's been a security

1419
01:20:58,909 --> 01:21:04,219
problem this traceability that we would

1420
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:09,080
spoke about earlier so in the end

1421
01:21:04,219 --> 01:21:11,600
there's a whole set of things so that

1422
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:12,639
even the algorithms have been broken you

1423
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:18,429
could still use it

1424
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:18,429
what's a Mifare classic card look like

1425
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:32,179
we've already seen the Java card the

1426
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:34,070
thing is this have a memory structures

1427
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:37,699
like the one that you can see on the

1428
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:41,719
screen it's a linear structure the

1429
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:46,219
previous speaker showed us a book about

1430
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:48,320
the assembler of the 8086 I used the

1431
01:21:46,219 --> 01:21:51,050
Motorola which had a linear memory you

1432
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:53,599
had a pointer and had to gradually move

1433
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:55,400
things the Mary was linear it was all

1434
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,100
very easy but here what we've got is the

1435
01:21:55,400 --> 01:22:05,299
same thing we've got some cards with a

1436
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:08,420
linear memory here I'm limited to the

1437
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:10,250
memory capacity that I have and how it's

1438
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:13,960
organized and it's organized in the way

1439
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:17,719
you can see in the screen where first

1440
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:22,280
I've got 16 sectors reached with 4

1441
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:28,449
blocks and each block has 16 bytes so

1442
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:28,449
you add it all up the card memory has 1k

1443
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:35,839
that means I can authenticate both the

1444
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:37,730
reader and the card so it's the sort of

1445
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,429
a control access but if you don't know

1446
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:43,638
the password or the pin number you can't

1447
01:22:40,429 --> 01:22:47,719
connect there to do that there are two

1448
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:50,540
keys key a and Kim key B and access

1449
01:22:47,719 --> 01:22:52,900
conditions in if you can write in a

1450
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:57,070
specific block mmm

1451
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:59,530
in this way you can block the features

1452
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:12,969
if if you can't do it the cards will

1453
01:22:59,530 --> 01:23:19,630
just reject it I would say error that's

1454
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:22,270
where mutual authentication comes from

1455
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:24,220
and that's where the crypt algorithms

1456
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:26,680
problems come from because it's a

1457
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:34,210
proprietary algorithm of NX P and a

1458
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:36,610
university a Dutch University started to

1459
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:39,730
analyze mathematically how the crypto

1460
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:43,929
algorithm works and they found that from

1461
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:48,690
a certain number operations onwards that

1462
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:53,680
what gate were faulty they were able to

1463
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:55,900
find out the system keys so from the

1464
01:23:53,680 --> 01:24:00,880
number of faults you can end up finding

1465
01:23:55,900 --> 01:24:04,269
the correct sir and that meant that they

1466
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:06,430
were able to deduce the keys that took

1467
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:10,890
them a while initially but actually you

1468
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:14,170
can now get them fairly easily so please

1469
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:18,190
be ethical don't do these sort of things

1470
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:19,720
just for the fun of it you can

1471
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:21,700
investigate an Internet but I'm not

1472
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:24,220
going to give you any sort of references

1473
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:29,740
to these kinds of things I've always

1474
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:34,660
told my students when they do this that

1475
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:36,969
if you're caught and you go to trial

1476
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:38,470
then I will not be there to defend you

1477
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:42,130
in fact completely the opposites we've

1478
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:46,900
all got our business and we don't like

1479
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:49,230
people upsetting us so don't upset other

1480
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,230
people

1481
01:24:53,800 --> 01:25:00,860
so nobody complains about using a

1482
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:03,800
certain browser but they earn lots of

1483
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:08,920
money from us so let's use to leave that

1484
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:11,840
to one side so that was broken in 2008

1485
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:14,090
the solutions were instead of having

1486
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:17,300
different keys you could create

1487
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:20,930
different keys for each card or getting

1488
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:24,500
the content in the cards counted even

1489
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:28,010
though it isn't encrypted I can encrypt

1490
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:30,320
it for every operation that I use and

1491
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:33,620
can store it in different accounts there

1492
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:36,500
a different alternative so that even the

1493
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:39,740
way we authenticated with the card has

1494
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:44,570
been broken I can still do it

1495
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:46,849
in any case NXP said that instead of

1496
01:25:44,570 --> 01:25:48,380
using the non-standard procedure which

1497
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:52,280
descriptor I'm going to use more

1498
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:55,190
standard ones so they issued some new

1499
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:57,200
cards called Mifare plus which is the

1500
01:25:55,190 --> 01:26:04,129
same as my fake plastic but instead of

1501
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:06,559
using kripp - they use ice 128 what

1502
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:09,920
happens is all the systems that are out

1503
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:13,610
in the street they don't use ice they

1504
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:17,570
use the crypto system and unless you go

1505
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:20,450
to a big city for example which has 500

1506
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:22,070
buses and that uses this thing maybe

1507
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:25,700
they've got 500 buses and they say you

1508
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:26,719
need to have Engine reversed on there

1509
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:29,570
mmm

1510
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:32,930
charging machines the adding up machines

1511
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:34,639
and a whole load of cards just to get

1512
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:38,150
they white

1513
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:41,870
listen separate from the black lists and

1514
01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:42,980
I'll bet you that not two not ten cities

1515
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:45,230
will do that of all the cities in the

1516
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:49,490
world and the fact this was half this

1517
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:55,759
has happened in Santander some guys did

1518
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:58,480
this and they actually got caught

1519
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,480
selling

1520
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:06,460
cards they only managed to get 20,000

1521
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:08,019
euros for this so I'm well there are

1522
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:10,540
lots of zeros here and some of the

1523
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:15,820
things that I've been doing I've managed

1524
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:18,790
to get official card keys and I could

1525
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:21,160
have loaded my card with thousands and

1526
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:22,930
thousands of euros and nothing would

1527
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:25,300
happen but you've got to be

1528
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:29,460
professionally ethical and I want to

1529
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:31,840
carry on working there's no point

1530
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:35,020
what's interesting here is to have this

1531
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:41,140
ethics and at least and I say this from

1532
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:45,630
a viewpoints of a more adults person you

1533
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:49,090
need to be ethical when you do things so

1534
01:27:45,630 --> 01:27:52,320
we've got this other card there which

1535
01:27:49,090 --> 01:27:56,370
instead of using fixed identifiers of

1536
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:59,549
four or seven bytes or you can also use

1537
01:27:56,370 --> 01:28:02,519
random ones so if you use random

1538
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:05,830
identifies that gives you additional

1539
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:07,840
security because not let's imagine it's

1540
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:13,809
an access control which is just based on

1541
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:17,500
the cards identify ID if it reads my ID

1542
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:19,540
when I go near the reader I can find a

1543
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:22,120
way of replicated and I go to the reader

1544
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:28,980
and I go in but if they identify that I

1545
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:31,000
get is random then first I have to

1546
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:34,179
authenticate and if I have to thought to

1547
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,430
get I need the keys and I can't get them

1548
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:42,040
that easily you need a little bit more

1549
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:44,860
time so it's awhile that you'd have to

1550
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:49,960
be near the reader and people would

1551
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:52,839
realize what you were doing and then

1552
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:55,990
there are other people that buy these

1553
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:58,870
metallic wallets so that their cars

1554
01:28:55,990 --> 01:29:02,170
can't be dis activated but they're

1555
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:06,130
insurance if people start ringing you're

1556
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:08,020
stealing your money you can actually

1557
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:10,360
ring up your insurance company in there

1558
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:12,250
and as long as you let them know they'll

1559
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:12,969
give you all the money back that's why

1560
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:16,270
we've

1561
01:29:12,969 --> 01:29:21,250
two chips because there was a moratorium

1562
01:29:16,270 --> 01:29:23,949
I think it was for 2005 there was a

1563
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:29,620
moratorium in which if you carried on

1564
01:29:23,949 --> 01:29:34,989
using a magnetic strip visa and

1565
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:37,300
mastercards wouldn't reimburse the

1566
01:29:34,989 --> 01:29:42,699
amount it would have to be the banks and

1567
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:44,500
savings banks that's why the chips were

1568
01:29:42,699 --> 01:29:45,610
introduced okay we're coming to the

1569
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:49,840
final part

1570
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:57,370
I've just got 20 minutes left I won't

1571
01:29:49,840 --> 01:30:00,030
have time for demos if you're interested

1572
01:29:57,370 --> 01:30:03,640
in we could do it at another time

1573
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:05,590
contactless technology let's now look at

1574
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:07,540
near field communication which is what

1575
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:13,120
we have in a telephone this is a

1576
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:14,380
telephone it's about four years and I

1577
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:18,580
didn't start using these sort of things

1578
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:22,260
until 2006 imagine for how long we could

1579
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:25,059
have had all of this in a mobile phone

1580
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:26,320
but there's somebody's saying no no and

1581
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:29,969
we don't know why don't know why they

1582
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:34,360
always technology isn't in one phone so

1583
01:30:29,969 --> 01:30:36,550
let's see look at our cards and they've

1584
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:37,960
got to a saturation point the amount of

1585
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:41,560
services I can think of is something

1586
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:45,190
that's missing and what's missing in the

1587
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:51,910
cart what it you need is a screen and a

1588
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:54,219
keyboard and nowadays if I don't

1589
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:56,320
communicate with the exterior it's

1590
01:30:54,219 --> 01:30:58,810
useless so if I take this to an

1591
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:01,500
environment which is the mobile

1592
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:01,500
environment

1593
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:06,650
the amount of operations and things that

1594
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:10,139
I could do with a card would multiply

1595
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:13,079
exponential exponentially so if you've

1596
01:31:10,139 --> 01:31:15,809
got an idea come to me we'll share it we

1597
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:19,829
can launch it and we'll get 50 50 or 70

1598
01:31:15,809 --> 01:31:23,939
30 that's fine many people say oh what

1599
01:31:19,829 --> 01:31:26,400
can we do what can we do and may well be

1600
01:31:23,939 --> 01:31:27,630
that I can't see any other uses but

1601
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,610
there's probably people out there that

1602
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:32,729
can see are they used to so if you've

1603
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:34,799
got any ideas you can make a mint here's

1604
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:38,030
some figures there from 2014

1605
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:40,739
but it's the penetration of mobile

1606
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:43,018
technology how many people in this room

1607
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:45,079
do not have a mobile phone please raise

1608
01:31:43,019 --> 01:31:48,179
your hand if you don't have mobile phone

1609
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:52,079
we've all got a mobile phone and office

1610
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:58,110
mobile phones between the ages of 18 and

1611
01:31:52,079 --> 01:32:03,539
24 this is 2014 so you can imagine this

1612
01:31:58,110 --> 01:32:05,489
people at middle age so the penetration

1613
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:08,630
of mobile phone is very high for we

1614
01:32:05,489 --> 01:32:13,938
deduce the bottom figure which is the

1615
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:16,590
expectations of mobile have nscc

1616
01:32:13,939 --> 01:32:20,130
technology we have to do is say that

1617
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:23,550
Apple did that did Apple pay and with

1618
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:26,999
iPhone 10 and I think with iPhone 8 you

1619
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:30,989
can now not just pay but also read cards

1620
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:33,030
with your phones which is great they've

1621
01:32:30,989 --> 01:32:37,530
opened a little bit of their system I

1622
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:39,869
haven't got an apple I mmm I phone 10

1623
01:32:37,530 --> 01:32:42,329
yet because I don't have any millions to

1624
01:32:39,869 --> 01:32:44,339
buy it but I would like to troll it just

1625
01:32:42,329 --> 01:32:46,619
to see the interface I've seen it in

1626
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:49,019
YouTube but it's not the same as seeing

1627
01:32:46,619 --> 01:32:50,789
it in reality it's like Samantha on the

1628
01:32:49,019 --> 01:32:56,489
telly says it's not the same living it

1629
01:32:50,789 --> 01:32:57,389
as saying it what are we gonna up what

1630
01:32:56,489 --> 01:33:00,829
are we going to see we're going to go

1631
01:32:57,389 --> 01:33:04,590
from this wallet it's all these

1632
01:33:00,829 --> 01:33:07,349
operations because the cart can also

1633
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:09,719
have health information it there are

1634
01:33:07,349 --> 01:33:12,869
projects which can have my data and

1635
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:16,579
create apps to say that for example I'm

1636
01:33:12,869 --> 01:33:16,579
diabetic I'm not but to imagine that

1637
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:25,770
and I have an anaphylactic shock and

1638
01:33:23,179 --> 01:33:27,900
somebody has to ring an ambulance for

1639
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:30,300
the ambulance comes they don't know if

1640
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:36,719
I'm diabetic or not and I can't tell

1641
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:38,580
them whether I am or not but perhaps you

1642
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:41,369
could have a card where in addition to

1643
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:43,800
say that I'm a diabetic it tells them

1644
01:33:41,369 --> 01:33:45,839
what sort of medicine I take and that

1645
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:49,320
would be securely store that information

1646
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:52,139
where only the health as personnel will

1647
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,549
have the keys to access and read them

1648
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:55,469
because that's the person that's gonna

1649
01:33:53,550 --> 01:34:00,599
save my life and obviously I'm not gonna

1650
01:33:55,469 --> 01:34:05,670
close the port to my card that is your

1651
01:34:00,599 --> 01:34:10,469
life records are kept safely this is

1652
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:14,670
something that we did I think 1012 years

1653
01:34:10,469 --> 01:34:19,469
ago and this project is used with with

1654
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:22,710
PDAs imagine all doctors these days have

1655
01:34:19,469 --> 01:34:25,550
a mobile and sometimes if you go to

1656
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:27,960
hospital you go to the A&E the doctor

1657
01:34:25,550 --> 01:34:30,719
it's usually playing with the what's up

1658
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:32,820
at the same time as treating you and the

1659
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:34,080
same with my students there's some

1660
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:36,150
students out there in the audience that

1661
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:37,710
I know are just playing with their what

1662
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:42,360
up and I what's up and I know that's

1663
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:44,630
what they're doing so for me the mobile

1664
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,630
phone

1665
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:53,370
there's always one in these talks

1666
01:34:58,110 --> 01:35:09,219
sorry that was a joke we're gonna go

1667
01:35:05,110 --> 01:35:11,019
from having a wallet to a normal wallet

1668
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:12,400
it's half of our wallets in a mobile it

1669
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:16,240
doesn't mean you put your mobile in your

1670
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:16,780
wallet other there lots of people do

1671
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:19,300
that

1672
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:22,000
no no what we want is for the cards to

1673
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:24,430
be in of the mobile that says you have a

1674
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:32,500
digital wallet so you can play with your

1675
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:35,110
phone in real time so but you can't do

1676
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:36,670
everything if you want to put a card in

1677
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:39,070
your phone this certain examples of

1678
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:41,830
which you can't use you can't just take

1679
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:44,320
a photo and say I've got my cards in the

1680
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:46,570
phone because I've got a photo it's not

1681
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:50,230
the same security the same information

1682
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:52,540
the information that I've stored the

1683
01:35:50,230 --> 01:35:54,519
safely isn't there so you can use a QR

1684
01:35:52,540 --> 01:35:56,740
code with you put a QR code which is

1685
01:35:54,520 --> 01:36:01,000
static I'm always gonna get the same

1686
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:07,030
information so why don't I just take a

1687
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:14,560
photo of the wallet for example there's

1688
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:18,400
an app for the mobile and I use a non

1689
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:21,010
apple non Android mobile phone and I

1690
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:24,250
don't have an app for this store I don't

1691
01:36:21,010 --> 01:36:26,950
have an app for this store I can't keep

1692
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:28,680
my discount card in the phone when the

1693
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:31,450
only thing that the discount has

1694
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:33,940
discount card is a barcode so if I take

1695
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:35,650
a photo of my barcode to put on the

1696
01:36:33,940 --> 01:36:39,309
screen that it'll do the same thing

1697
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:43,170
there's no additional security because

1698
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:46,840
the lady at the cash desk has said no

1699
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:49,450
okay you can't use it so I'm gonna I'm

1700
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:50,920
going to complain with I have no one so

1701
01:36:49,450 --> 01:36:55,110
that for the reasons why I needed to

1702
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:57,800
have that I'm going to be injected with

1703
01:36:55,110 --> 01:36:59,719
advertising it's visual with

1704
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:02,090
what I want you to know is that we have

1705
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:05,420
something else more inside his part

1706
01:37:02,090 --> 01:37:12,320
changes and we have it with the NVC

1707
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:16,880
technology so the NVC technology allows

1708
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:19,549
us for its short range in fact instead

1709
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:22,610
of wireless technology I put this

1710
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:25,910
technology within chips either so I have

1711
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:28,639
a chip all the the logic part I put it

1712
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:31,519
in the chip and I can put it within

1713
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:33,770
specific devices instead of a in a card

1714
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:39,080
I can put it in the mobile as a sensor

1715
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:41,960
or wearable or anywhere if somebody can

1716
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:45,170
integrate that for me so I have an added

1717
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:47,900
functionality it's compatible it uses

1718
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:49,640
the same frequency band and the same

1719
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:53,509
communication protocols that I use with

1720
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:56,350
my cards in office us while the cut

1721
01:37:53,510 --> 01:38:01,010
cards don't have heterogeneous

1722
01:37:56,350 --> 01:38:02,510
interfaces keyboard display etc I have

1723
01:38:01,010 --> 01:38:05,780
what I didn't have before

1724
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:08,210
I can have my card in a specific device

1725
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:11,240
that is not plastic it's embedded in

1726
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:19,250
another system in this case a mobile

1727
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:22,429
phone but we we can use wearables if you

1728
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:24,950
have an Apple watch you can get close to

1729
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:30,880
the card and you can pay because there's

1730
01:38:24,950 --> 01:38:33,800
an S NFC chip inside so this it just

1731
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:35,960
this this is stupid

1732
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:39,730
device because it needs a reader because

1733
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:42,780
my mobile phone is not stupid anymore

1734
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:45,579
so let's

1735
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:48,699
think okay instead of having it NVC

1736
01:38:45,579 --> 01:38:52,299
instead one mode it which is card

1737
01:38:48,699 --> 01:38:53,409
emulation my book mobile phone works as

1738
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:57,630
a card

1739
01:38:53,409 --> 01:39:02,888
well my mobile phone can be a reader I

1740
01:38:57,630 --> 01:39:06,849
can get my cut close an ear of the phone

1741
01:39:02,889 --> 01:39:10,780
and it can be a reader and then I can

1742
01:39:06,849 --> 01:39:13,179
pave and I can take and get one phone

1743
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:17,400
near another device and they can do

1744
01:39:13,179 --> 01:39:21,760
operations between them the peer-to-peer

1745
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:25,388
communication it's the typical examples

1746
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:28,269
of height of loudspeakers you put the

1747
01:39:25,389 --> 01:39:33,130
phone on top of the loudspeaker and it's

1748
01:39:28,269 --> 01:39:35,710
connected by bluetooth with no keys it's

1749
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:39,780
done within it vc technology there's

1750
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:45,550
data exchanged from a phone to another

1751
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:53,679
device that can be a loudspeaker here

1752
01:39:45,550 --> 01:39:57,489
you have this usage case one day in the

1753
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:59,679
what a day in the life of a user I wake

1754
01:39:57,489 --> 01:40:03,089
up I see my agenda I go to the

1755
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:07,449
underground I pay for my breakfast and

1756
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:12,699
instead of fine finding a QR code which

1757
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:16,480
is static and if it's painted over I

1758
01:40:12,699 --> 01:40:21,070
can't I can't read the QR code it's not

1759
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:24,699
infrared camera if I have the NVC label

1760
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:28,058
I can do it so I can near this place and

1761
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:30,638
I do I get Interactive Advertising I can

1762
01:40:28,059 --> 01:40:33,820
have a free trip on the bus it's an

1763
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:36,670
interactive operation then I go to my

1764
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:38,699
office and I say look I'm going to give

1765
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:42,690
you the tickets that I bought yesterday

1766
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:48,039
it's not what a QR code it's a secure

1767
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:52,598
ticket a digital ticket it's not about

1768
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:54,340
this QR beings can't like good

1769
01:40:52,599 --> 01:40:55,989
been like you if I give you this

1770
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:58,030
nobody's gonna check it because there's

1771
01:40:55,989 --> 01:41:07,419
no additional information with no photo

1772
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:09,879
etc so I go to cafeteria and I pay with

1773
01:41:07,419 --> 01:41:12,429
my mobile phone and then I need to go

1774
01:41:09,879 --> 01:41:15,939
shopping instead of doing my shopping

1775
01:41:12,429 --> 01:41:21,399
list I can go to a place where I get

1776
01:41:15,939 --> 01:41:25,090
near the tilde labels like Amazon - this

1777
01:41:21,399 --> 01:41:28,780
device one in fact you could have one

1778
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:32,469
five euros it was worn by Amazon with

1779
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:36,909
for one year oh no you could buy some of

1780
01:41:32,469 --> 01:41:38,679
them and have free free pouches I have

1781
01:41:36,909 --> 01:41:45,570
in enough devices in my office so I

1782
01:41:38,679 --> 01:41:48,550
don't need it so you can pair it up

1783
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:52,030
instead of having the Amazon - I can use

1784
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:56,919
my book mobile phone directly I go home

1785
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:58,499
at night and I say oh the phone is on my

1786
01:41:56,919 --> 01:42:03,249
table

1787
01:41:58,499 --> 01:42:07,929
normally we we sleep or near our phone

1788
01:42:03,249 --> 01:42:10,079
it's bad because if I get a wet top at

1789
01:42:07,929 --> 01:42:12,429
3:00 in the morning I'm gonna answer

1790
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:15,188
radiations are bad for your brain

1791
01:42:12,429 --> 01:42:23,760
so don't sleep near your mobile phone so

1792
01:42:15,189 --> 01:42:26,229
I I just I even switch my Wi-Fi off to

1793
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:28,449
during the night so I would use the

1794
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:30,099
phone here I put it on the table and

1795
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:32,969
there's a label or information which

1796
01:42:30,099 --> 01:42:37,359
which will say automatically it's a

1797
01:42:32,969 --> 01:42:39,699
plain mode just the alarm for the the

1798
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:43,239
alarm clock is working or I get to my

1799
01:42:39,699 --> 01:42:47,348
car bluetooth is activated connect to

1800
01:42:43,239 --> 01:42:50,228
your car I put label I get near to the

1801
01:42:47,349 --> 01:42:53,379
label and bluetooth is activated thanks

1802
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:57,159
to my mobile phone it's calm mode so

1803
01:42:53,379 --> 01:43:00,608
that you don't get the SMSs the display

1804
01:42:57,159 --> 01:43:03,429
might change for big buttons to appear

1805
01:43:00,609 --> 01:43:05,390
all these actions we can automate

1806
01:43:03,429 --> 01:43:07,700
because the mobile is a

1807
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:13,130
either of labels we can do many other

1808
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:15,530
things the first thing that I used to do

1809
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:20,240
with in emphysema

1810
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:26,380
it was about the washing machine I don't

1811
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:30,080
need to open it up to have a contact

1812
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:32,390
normally electronic devices have LCD

1813
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:36,190
displays but in the past of it just

1814
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:39,680
lights and when we you called to the

1815
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:46,910
repair service the people asked you what

1816
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:50,240
is the light of this in red or in green

1817
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:54,470
now I get my mobile phone near to my

1818
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:56,960
washing machine the NVC protocol allows

1819
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:59,870
for this communication there's a

1820
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:02,270
transfer then I push the fans and the

1821
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:06,530
technical service guy receives the full

1822
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:09,950
status of my washing machine it appears

1823
01:44:06,530 --> 01:44:12,050
on the display so the person there the

1824
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:14,780
repair guy knows what happens to my

1825
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:19,220
washing machine I send you a technician

1826
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:22,309
and he knows what's your problem just

1827
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:24,920
one person come in one time just once we

1828
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:28,420
can do that we can configure our Wi-Fi I

1829
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:33,110
didn't know that the key was that Oh

1830
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:35,650
somebody told me I had to type it we

1831
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:38,630
could have labels the entrance saying

1832
01:44:35,650 --> 01:44:41,240
put your NVC phone near to this label

1833
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:47,540
and then automatically your Wi-Fi is

1834
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:50,260
configured this type of actions we can

1835
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:55,190
do that with a simple thing your touch

1836
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:57,020
phone there are commercial solutions

1837
01:44:55,190 --> 01:45:00,040
these are the differences between QR

1838
01:44:57,020 --> 01:45:00,040
codes and at NVC

1839
01:45:03,710 --> 01:45:15,720
here maybe this is biased through and

1840
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:18,660
towards NBC technology when PC it's fine

1841
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:21,180
it requires an application yes because

1842
01:45:18,660 --> 01:45:23,130
the read reading of an thisi phone when

1843
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:26,400
it says requires application it's very

1844
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:28,890
positively doesn't require in fact to

1845
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:31,530
read labels there is embedded

1846
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:36,710
applications in the operative system in

1847
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:36,710
your phone when you get near the boss

1848
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:44,759
near the bus stops you you have labels

1849
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:48,210
and says math Santander there's a QR

1850
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:52,020
code and if you get you from closer to

1851
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:54,450
this to this NVC labels it's gonna give

1852
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:58,320
you an your URL it's gonna take an egg

1853
01:45:54,450 --> 01:46:00,510
directly to a site saying so many

1854
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:03,620
minutes until the bus gets to this bus

1855
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:07,830
stop with a QR code it works but if I

1856
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:10,200
I'm late with ASP and I put a spray or

1857
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:16,320
an ink on top of the QR code doesn't

1858
01:46:10,200 --> 01:46:18,450
work anymore in the QR it needs an

1859
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:22,170
application because there's no standard

1860
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:24,090
protocols so we need to download an

1861
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:27,270
application because mobile phone do not

1862
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:30,540
incorporate these applications others

1863
01:46:27,270 --> 01:46:32,880
don't read anything here you see the

1864
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:35,400
usability of these two types of

1865
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:42,000
technologies it's better to touch it

1866
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:45,690
than to need too many actions for the

1867
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:48,330
same purpose and feces better cost it's

1868
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:50,190
a little bit more expensive but at the

1869
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:53,250
end of the day it's value-added its

1870
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:56,280
durability the NVC label I can rewrite

1871
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:59,160
it when I want I can block it but I can

1872
01:46:56,280 --> 01:47:02,610
rewrite it if I want the QR code I have

1873
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:05,519
to put everything down the bus stop the

1874
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:08,610
post and and to reprint it and I want I

1875
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:12,420
need to keep the format so it's better

1876
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:14,880
to use a label with a logo it's nice and

1877
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:16,059
beautiful and I don't need to use these

1878
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:21,010
QR with

1879
01:47:16,059 --> 01:47:23,800
black boxes and now this is the part

1880
01:47:21,010 --> 01:47:26,800
about the security the mobile is a

1881
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:30,099
reader okay the mobile phone has

1882
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:33,460
emulator even if you can't believe this

1883
01:47:30,099 --> 01:47:37,210
well you have already your smart card in

1884
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:39,000
your mobile phones here in the whole

1885
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:45,460
world

1886
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:49,119
we have square thingy movie star

1887
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:53,199
Vodafone Amen I arranged a mass mobile

1888
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:57,089
and this told telephonic operators give

1889
01:47:53,199 --> 01:48:03,058
us a SIM card a SIM card is a smart card

1890
01:47:57,090 --> 01:48:06,130
this smart card used by the telephone

1891
01:48:03,059 --> 01:48:08,020
operators of in fact give it to us

1892
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:10,659
because it's a multi application card I

1893
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:15,670
can download a lot of applications to

1894
01:48:10,659 --> 01:48:17,888
these markets in a SIM card so I sell

1895
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:20,230
you the space inside the card and maybe

1896
01:48:17,889 --> 01:48:22,059
you have to pay for that this SIM card

1897
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:25,780
is linked to them your mobile phone you

1898
01:48:22,059 --> 01:48:28,360
have different alternatives this is to

1899
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:31,599
understand Apple pay SIM card is perfect

1900
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:34,598
for me it's the perfect case if you

1901
01:48:31,599 --> 01:48:37,719
it's a white card and I can change my

1902
01:48:34,599 --> 01:48:39,940
operator in a rapid way if there's a

1903
01:48:37,719 --> 01:48:43,449
market where they can download or make

1904
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:46,210
operations in a secure way because SIM

1905
01:48:43,449 --> 01:48:48,579
cards are in alter mobile phones until

1906
01:48:46,210 --> 01:48:51,630
now maybe this is going to be just a

1907
01:48:48,579 --> 01:48:54,730
chip but but it's full of a full of

1908
01:48:51,630 --> 01:48:56,619
potential I'll do it with their

1909
01:48:54,730 --> 01:49:02,739
applications changing the possibilities

1910
01:48:56,619 --> 01:49:06,909
of the same Samsung and Google Nexus S

1911
01:49:02,739 --> 01:49:08,558
phone they had an embedded element but

1912
01:49:06,909 --> 01:49:13,239
it's controlled by the manufacturer of

1913
01:49:08,559 --> 01:49:16,270
the phone I sent emails to Google to

1914
01:49:13,239 --> 01:49:19,000
have the keys in order to save

1915
01:49:16,270 --> 01:49:21,039
information in that mobile phone but

1916
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,199
they didn't say anything to me we can

1917
01:49:21,039 --> 01:49:26,920
have micro SD s added elements in a

1918
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:29,230
phone it could become a smart card but

1919
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:29,980
this elements are very sensitive because

1920
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:33,339
that's where

1921
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:35,919
we keep our photos etc if I don't have a

1922
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:41,110
big capacity I don't accept it and micro

1923
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:45,150
SD s with an NFC with an emulator well

1924
01:49:41,110 --> 01:49:49,929
the memory capacities are very limited

1925
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:53,620
so we don't like his systems it's not

1926
01:49:49,930 --> 01:49:55,180
very comfortable the micro SD in our

1927
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:59,590
mobile phones sometimes it's difficult

1928
01:49:55,180 --> 01:50:02,110
to get there and batteries are hiding

1929
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:05,580
the signal so it's not very it's not

1930
01:50:02,110 --> 01:50:09,009
very comfortable it's not effective so

1931
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:12,940
somebody had an idea it's not Google who

1932
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:15,210
in bit which invented this the first to

1933
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:19,089
implement this were BlackBerry people

1934
01:50:15,210 --> 01:50:22,300
it's called host card emulation instead

1935
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:24,610
of emulating the card within a hardware

1936
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:29,620
environment our emulated within the

1937
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:33,339
software environment it's an a software

1938
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:34,000
environment so I don't nobody has the

1939
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:36,640
control

1940
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,850
I will do my application put it in the

1941
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:43,930
market and open a range of possibilities

1942
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:46,470
to do the a card emulation operation how

1943
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:46,470
does it work

1944
01:50:46,590 --> 01:50:54,510
blackberries started with this several

1945
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:59,290
years ago and then Google with a KitKat

1946
01:50:54,510 --> 01:51:05,260
Android version that was done by Google

1947
01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:07,600
and then Google Wallet started and Apple

1948
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:10,930
had the idea to have Apple pay but it

1949
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:12,580
was closed but then similar procedures

1950
01:51:10,930 --> 01:51:14,830
were standardized and Visa and

1951
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:18,010
MasterCard started to do that how does

1952
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:21,160
it work I have my BOB mobile phone with

1953
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:25,810
a secure element I have a SIM card

1954
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:29,650
that's secure it boy than NFC a

1955
01:51:25,810 --> 01:51:33,130
controller and they have a CPU when I

1956
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:36,250
put my phone a near a reader what

1957
01:51:33,130 --> 01:51:39,730
happens if I just have secure elements

1958
01:51:36,250 --> 01:51:41,680
judge the SIM card the controller when I

1959
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:43,780
select the application of a car it's

1960
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:48,840
going to go to the secure element but

1961
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:52,329
if I have activated the Husker emulation

1962
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:54,369
HC then the microcontroller says I have

1963
01:51:52,329 --> 01:51:57,670
an application that is registered in

1964
01:51:54,369 --> 01:52:00,880
software mode say it says yes or no if

1965
01:51:57,670 --> 01:52:04,869
it's yes it's bypassed and it sends me

1966
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:10,570
to my app it's an Android app I have

1967
01:52:04,869 --> 01:52:14,589
another demo and the software then is

1968
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:18,159
activated and I can do anything my smart

1969
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:22,179
card con can walk in my app or can be

1970
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:24,879
run in my app and the whole of my smart

1971
01:52:22,179 --> 01:52:29,020
card works in the cloud I sent the data

1972
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:32,199
in a secure mode with encryption and it

1973
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:34,270
can get to net HSN which is a hardware

1974
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:36,308
security module and this with the

1975
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:38,770
security it can keep my information

1976
01:52:36,309 --> 01:52:43,119
secure what I do with HCE

1977
01:52:38,770 --> 01:52:45,699
is in fact the u.s. apps that go to the

1978
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:48,880
Earth's market now they go to Android or

1979
01:52:45,699 --> 01:52:52,629
to iOS Stan well whatever Windows 10 you

1980
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:54,400
can use it in a software environment it

1981
01:52:52,630 --> 01:52:58,780
works it works in your Windows 10

1982
01:52:54,400 --> 01:53:05,829
because I'm a user I'm still using

1983
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:08,199
Windows so I have that into my mobile

1984
01:53:05,829 --> 01:53:12,489
application and then I have procedures

1985
01:53:08,199 --> 01:53:14,230
that's very similar to those that I

1986
01:53:12,489 --> 01:53:17,019
programmed in into the cart

1987
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:20,799
if I program the card I just need to

1988
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:23,590
change the apps names the API is the API

1989
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:25,989
names and then then I can put it in an

1990
01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:27,520
application or open a communications

1991
01:53:25,989 --> 01:53:30,519
channel through the in through the

1992
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:33,210
Internet and that's where the advantages

1993
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:35,770
are I can have more implementation

1994
01:53:33,210 --> 01:53:40,900
possibilities because I don't need to go

1995
01:53:35,770 --> 01:53:42,699
through certifications but I would need

1996
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:48,009
to have certifications it's good but

1997
01:53:42,699 --> 01:53:50,829
there are drawbacks when using a NVC the

1998
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:53,050
sim card if I didn't have battery in my

1999
01:53:50,829 --> 01:53:57,530
phone I could continue to pay because

2000
01:53:53,050 --> 01:54:00,630
it's a card and doesn't need any battery

2001
01:53:57,530 --> 01:54:02,449
so I can activate the same in my phone

2002
01:54:00,630 --> 01:54:04,739
without a battery but if I'm doing

2003
01:54:02,449 --> 01:54:06,509
something and I need a communications

2004
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:12,150
interface to the external world

2005
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:17,370
I need the battery so I don't have

2006
01:54:12,150 --> 01:54:19,799
enough battery for everything so they

2007
01:54:17,370 --> 01:54:22,469
will have a problem of battery when it's

2008
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:24,660
what happens when it's switched off we

2009
01:54:22,469 --> 01:54:28,790
can't do the operations there's a lack

2010
01:54:24,660 --> 01:54:35,580
of interoperability its standard because

2011
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:38,570
it's a according to a standard but we

2012
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:41,760
can't use the Mayfair classic cards and

2013
01:54:38,570 --> 01:54:43,530
there's another problem in all software

2014
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:48,510
environments it's open to attacks

2015
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:53,780
malware etc these malware attacks could

2016
01:54:48,510 --> 01:54:57,449
be avoided while trying to creating

2017
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:59,849
specific environment in our phones

2018
01:54:57,449 --> 01:55:03,509
these are environments when you root the

2019
01:54:59,850 --> 01:55:06,810
phone they are closed so that nobody can

2020
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:08,850
open them if we use these operations we

2021
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:10,430
can minimize the risk but there's always

2022
01:55:08,850 --> 01:55:14,670
a risk

2023
01:55:10,430 --> 01:55:24,030
so we emulate the card so we have the

2024
01:55:14,670 --> 01:55:27,660
phone but I had an Apple watch all this

2025
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:30,719
who Elway or a smart band with NPC it's

2026
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:34,260
the same I put the chip inside and I can

2027
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:37,770
do anything I'm the user is going to

2028
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:40,980
decide the one I prefer I'm finishing

2029
01:55:37,770 --> 01:55:46,380
now because it's only three minutes to 8

2030
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:49,199
p.m. I'm not going to do the demos how

2031
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:54,780
mobile payment works you can use it with

2032
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:58,889
a Visa or a buffet instead of using the

2033
01:55:54,780 --> 01:56:02,160
card only there is a token in fact it's

2034
01:55:58,890 --> 01:56:04,440
virtualizing the card instead of

2035
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:05,760
generating or keeping in my phone number

2036
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:08,790
than my real number

2037
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:11,240
my real card number I asked and I

2038
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:17,850
request a token

2039
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:21,030
to my bank I send my card number sent me

2040
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:23,730
tokens that are virtual tokens these

2041
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:26,849
tokens have information related to the

2042
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:30,769
maximum amount of money that I can pay

2043
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:34,200
it can be only linked to my mobile if I

2044
01:56:30,770 --> 01:56:37,410
lose it I can use it for two hours or

2045
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:39,570
this is the content of tokens and I can

2046
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:44,099
download the tokens in my phone and I

2047
01:56:39,570 --> 01:56:48,000
use tokens to pay when I pay I give the

2048
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:50,880
token to the tpv the tpv covers the

2049
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:53,520
network and it matches the token that

2050
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:56,250
has received with the number of well the

2051
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:57,720
real card number the token and the card

2052
01:56:56,250 --> 01:57:00,210
numbers given to the bank and the bank

2053
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:03,390
validates this operation it's ok you can

2054
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:06,330
pay if it works it's fantastic and the

2055
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:11,370
payment is done so we are emulating a

2056
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:14,190
part of an smart card with tokens and we

2057
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:20,340
send tokens and that's the end of my

2058
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:23,400
presentation just conclusions the smart

2059
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:27,570
cards one of the most secure devices

2060
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:32,309
today we can guarantee that the great

2061
01:57:27,570 --> 01:57:35,700
question why because I have a lot of

2062
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:37,800
cards in my pocket and why do if I

2063
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:41,070
wanted I would prefer to have a just a

2064
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:44,390
single card technology allows and for

2065
01:57:41,070 --> 01:57:48,630
this even though it's a secure element

2066
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:52,050
I'm not going to say it but I think it's

2067
01:57:48,630 --> 01:57:55,530
possible there might be security

2068
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:59,250
problems it's not a magic recipe and the

2069
01:57:55,530 --> 01:58:02,040
last if I forget my wallet I don't want

2070
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:07,800
good to go home again but if I forget my

2071
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:10,470
phone I go home I go back home if you

2072
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:13,560
leave your card home there's no problem

2073
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:16,650
but if you forget your mobile phone you

2074
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:19,340
go back to recover it so if it's in my

2075
01:58:16,650 --> 01:58:23,009
mobile phone my cards will be there in

2076
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:24,240
mobilize our extension I have a

2077
01:58:23,010 --> 01:58:25,860
philosophy when

2078
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:28,349
speak with a colleague and there's a

2079
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:31,679
what's up and he starts to answer that

2080
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:33,660
what's up I go around and I go away

2081
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:35,670
because I I'm not talking to you while

2082
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:38,040
you're answering your whatsapp you don't

2083
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:40,350
need to answer immediately you can wait

2084
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:42,210
for a minute but now I'm wasting my time

2085
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:44,280
with you so we need to have social

2086
01:58:42,210 --> 01:58:48,330
interaction not social networks or

2087
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:51,240
social media I can say I'm a very

2088
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:53,630
handsome person and a rich man but in

2089
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:56,550
fact I'm lying

2090
01:58:53,630 --> 01:58:58,980
so social interaction is what I'm

2091
01:58:56,550 --> 01:59:01,950
looking for it's good for people here

2092
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:05,429
and online people have listened to me

2093
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:08,220
we've been interacting this is one of

2094
01:59:05,430 --> 01:59:11,960
the lessons I want to convey and last

2095
01:59:08,220 --> 01:59:15,410
but not least this is my great question

2096
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:19,710
when are we going to avoid plastics

2097
01:59:15,410 --> 01:59:20,160
because it's always in plastic I don't

2098
01:59:19,710 --> 01:59:23,760
know

2099
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:25,980
when plastic cards will disappear I

2100
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:30,180
thought there was gonna be no plastics

2101
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:32,070
now but in fact we don't have their new

2102
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:35,250
situation when we can just forget about

2103
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:38,190
plastic I'll be very happy when we don't

2104
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:40,830
need any cards of this type I'll be very

2105
01:59:38,190 --> 01:59:44,750
happy and very safe I can open my car

2106
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:48,809
with my mobile phones or when booking a

2107
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:53,820
car I can send the key to my mobile and

2108
01:59:48,810 --> 01:59:57,900
then I can open the car many functions

2109
01:59:53,820 --> 02:00:00,660
that we can use with my card or allowing

2110
01:59:57,900 --> 02:00:03,900
our phone to read smart cards it's your

2111
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:07,530
imagination these applications will be

2112
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:13,500
successful thanks to you and that's the

2113
02:00:07,530 --> 02:00:16,980
end thank you my contact Alberto's

2114
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:21,930

2115
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:25,709
address if you want to contact us if you

2116

02:00:27,690 --> 02:00:34,559
honest I'll say I don't know and I'll

2119
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:37,380
try to look for an answer if you're

2120
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:40,219
interested sometimes we organize courses

2121
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:43,949
in university and in other universities

2122
02:00:40,219 --> 02:00:47,040
we show the demos that I couldn't show

2123
02:00:43,949 --> 02:00:50,940
you today and I'm sorry for that because

2124
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:55,290
I didn't have time B I was going to show

2125
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:58,379
you the application but after the

2126
02:00:55,290 --> 02:01:01,199
streaming I'll be with you if you want

2127
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:04,250
to see it it's two hours it's a long

2128
02:01:01,199 --> 02:01:04,250
time II wasn't easy

2129
02:01:05,449 --> 02:01:20,549
who dies there's a question I'm I'm

2130
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:20,909
tired I wake I was up at 6:00 in the

2131
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:24,270
morning

2132
02:01:20,909 --> 02:01:29,370
good good afternoon you gave us a master

2133
02:01:24,270 --> 02:01:31,560
class of how cars work but in our

2134
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:34,500
society we are in fact two types of

2135
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:37,050
customers the young customers and the

2136
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:39,750
old customers how many old people's or

2137
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:44,150
how many people more than 50 years of

2138
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:46,770
age are here in the room the telephone

2139
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:49,920
penetration curvy and what is do what is

2140
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:51,989
the university doing for oldies but the

2141
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:55,830
university of canterbury ah it's our

2142
02:01:51,989 --> 02:01:58,589
university we don't have a program for

2143
02:01:55,830 --> 02:02:00,719
oldies for those who want to get

2144
02:01:58,590 --> 02:02:06,389
initiated in this technologist yes

2145
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:09,090
you'll have the senior program the

2146
02:02:06,389 --> 02:02:10,639
senior program well gives you something

2147
02:02:09,090 --> 02:02:13,620
else but not this

2148
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:16,080
somebody should explain to us what the

2149
02:02:13,620 --> 02:02:18,090
technology is all about how would this

2150
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:20,659
devices work in university there's

2151
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:24,659
nothing for us I went to the Secretariat

2152
02:02:20,659 --> 02:02:26,849
because I am a teacher and we didn't

2153
02:02:24,659 --> 02:02:30,299
need this smart card because the

2154
02:02:26,850 --> 02:02:32,880
mathematics teacher knew us all we

2155
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:35,699
didn't need a card because we were few

2156
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:38,730
students I wanted the university to have

2157
02:02:35,699 --> 02:02:42,150
something for old people as simple thing

2158
02:02:38,730 --> 02:02:46,138
or intermediate thing between the use

2159
02:02:42,150 --> 02:02:48,589
and the theory the university says that

2160
02:02:46,139 --> 02:02:51,590
I have to register

2161
02:02:48,590 --> 02:02:54,230
for all them subject matters I cannot

2162
02:02:51,590 --> 02:02:56,150
just pick one or two much subject

2163
02:02:54,230 --> 02:03:00,139
matters what is the is the answer of

2164
02:02:56,150 --> 02:03:02,000
university who's the person I could

2165
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:04,150
contact yes there are dissemination

2166
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:08,750
activities in university not just

2167
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:11,420
degrees or master's program for instance

2168
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:15,470
for this smartcards topic last year we

2169
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:18,890
organized a course summer course like

2170
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:22,400
WIMP courses this our specialization

2171
02:03:18,890 --> 02:03:26,450
courses for specific topics we organized

2172
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:29,420
this course for smart cards and apart

2173
02:03:26,450 --> 02:03:32,650
from what I just said this course was 20

2174
02:03:29,420 --> 02:03:35,960
hours long and I had very good feedback

2175
02:03:32,650 --> 02:03:37,759
they would have needed like 30 hours a

2176
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:42,550
two weeks course because I didn't have

2177
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:48,010
time these courses are more for

2178
02:03:42,550 --> 02:03:51,440
dissemination to teach this technology

2179
02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:54,610
sometimes it's just mental eluc

2180
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:57,410
aberrations and it's a bit crazy but

2181
02:03:54,610 --> 02:03:59,870
sometimes I feel that I'm more a

2182
02:03:57,410 --> 02:04:03,380
research an engineer than a researcher

2183
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:06,530
but I want my research to be applied in

2184
02:04:03,380 --> 02:04:08,600
the streets that's why we're here I come

2185
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:10,540
here to show you something that you use

2186
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:14,030
every day so that you can understand it

2187
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:16,880
so we have course this summer courses we

2188
02:04:14,030 --> 02:04:18,950
have the science weeks and we have the

2189
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:24,820
other activities that are organized from

2190
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:27,110
time to time visits and additionally I

2191
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:29,420
can give you an example because I have

2192
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:31,400
students here you have my email and my

2193
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:35,900
phone number if you have any technology

2194
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:37,549
query and questions please ask me and

2195
02:04:35,900 --> 02:04:41,330
come to my classes because you're are

2196
02:04:37,550 --> 02:04:43,490
inviting maybe people in university are

2197
02:04:41,330 --> 02:04:45,830
going to be very very cross at me people

2198
02:04:43,490 --> 02:04:47,650
are paying for the degree course but I

2199
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:52,340
do online courses

2200
02:04:47,650 --> 02:04:55,070
it's called OpenCourseWare these are

2201
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:58,730
online courses in the website of the

2202
02:04:55,070 --> 02:05:00,110
University and this is the same in other

2203
02:04:58,730 --> 02:05:02,388
Spanish universities

2204
02:05:00,110 --> 02:05:07,759
in the u.s. you have EDX platform

2205
02:05:02,389 --> 02:05:11,449
Myriad's Coursera etc you have courses

2206
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:14,960
the university courses even if you don't

2207
02:05:11,449 --> 02:05:18,769
believe me there's a guy giving courses

2208
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:22,179
well I watched it I watched videos the

2209
02:05:18,770 --> 02:05:24,409
machine learning courses there are

2210
02:05:22,179 --> 02:05:29,469
interesting online courses through

2211
02:05:24,409 --> 02:05:32,179
videos it's not done in our university

2212
02:05:29,469 --> 02:05:35,360
we have online courses on machine

2213
02:05:32,179 --> 02:05:37,239
learning that are for free they're open

2214
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:39,739
but they don't give you the degree

2215
02:05:37,239 --> 02:05:43,699
normally you pay registration for the

2216
02:05:39,739 --> 02:05:48,049
degree but have you can go and listen to

2217
02:05:43,699 --> 02:05:53,119
the classes to the courses but there's a

2218
02:05:48,050 --> 02:05:55,880
list of courses that you can choose my

2219
02:05:53,119 --> 02:05:59,269
job in the university is not secured not

2220
02:05:55,880 --> 02:06:03,980
more than three years so maybe I'm a

2221
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:08,719
nothing in university so it depends more

2222
02:06:03,980 --> 02:06:12,379
on the heist fears if you people want to

2223
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:15,170
learn more they would need to allow you

2224
02:06:12,380 --> 02:06:19,810
to pay your registration fee for

2225
02:06:15,170 --> 02:06:24,500
specific subject matters of a specific

2226
02:06:19,810 --> 02:06:28,580
lectures how does whatsapp work

2227
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:34,639
what about internet of things will teach

2228
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:38,659
how this works we do it in our courses

2229
02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:41,270
in a and I do agree with you instead of

2230
02:06:38,659 --> 02:06:43,339
registering for the full courses you

2231
02:06:41,270 --> 02:06:46,730
could pick one specific subject matter

2232
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:51,070
maybe you can do it my recommendation is

2233
02:06:46,730 --> 02:06:56,989
that you have to go to the university or

2234
02:06:51,070 --> 02:07:01,389
online courses summer courses science

2235
02:06:56,989 --> 02:07:04,339
weeks with people like us that do

2236
02:07:01,389 --> 02:07:10,159
dissemination and then we can be in

2237
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:12,739
contact we're not a shell we're not a

2238
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:13,909
closed shell we are open to society we

2239
02:07:12,739 --> 02:07:16,790
just love it

2240
02:07:13,909 --> 02:07:19,210
we've done a lot of videos showing how

2241
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:23,840
this intelligent the smart city works

2242
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:26,409
the news services have followed us we've

2243
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:31,600
taken part in conferences and congresses

2244
02:07:26,409 --> 02:07:34,780
this is free here today see this course

2245
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:38,840
even if you can't he don't believe me

2246
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:42,530
and I told a colleague what I've done it

2247
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:46,429
in my practice my tuition when I did

2248
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:48,230
this several years ago that the price

2249
02:07:46,429 --> 02:07:51,170
was thousands of years had to pay

2250
02:07:48,230 --> 02:07:55,570
thousands of euros for this and now it's

2251
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:58,940
free this is a very specific technology

2252
02:07:55,570 --> 02:08:02,239
all this talks in fact this is done by

2253
02:07:58,940 --> 02:08:05,110
University and I honestly think that

2254
02:08:02,239 --> 02:08:13,190
university is as of is offering

2255
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:17,449
activities of this type and I can I can

2256
02:08:13,190 --> 02:08:20,269
offer you what I can if I have time okay

2257
02:08:17,449 --> 02:08:23,750
we can sit down together on Saturday and

2258
02:08:20,270 --> 02:08:28,610
then I can go with you and I'll say

2259
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:30,500
hello to my wife and I will explain and

2260
02:08:28,610 --> 02:08:33,710
I answer your questions Alberta would do

2261
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:36,920
the same way already university does

2262
02:08:33,710 --> 02:08:40,040
tuition and research but dissemination

2263
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:42,830
it's what people ask for and sometimes

2264
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:47,659
what people ask for it's not something

2265
02:08:42,830 --> 02:08:49,929
that people give we are assessing us we

2266
02:08:47,659 --> 02:08:52,820
are assessed through the dissemination

2267
02:08:49,929 --> 02:08:54,949
products which are called articles and

2268
02:08:52,820 --> 02:08:58,400
those articles are not read by people

2269
02:08:54,949 --> 02:09:01,790
like you but a blog is read read by many

2270
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:06,280
people if I do YouTube videos and blogs

2271
02:09:01,790 --> 02:09:09,530
it this is more appreciated than

2272
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:11,840
specific articles because I'm talking to

2273
02:09:09,530 --> 02:09:14,860
people in the street people have to

2274
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:17,360
understand what we do in university

2275
02:09:14,860 --> 02:09:19,219
let's explain what you we do in

2276
02:09:17,360 --> 02:09:23,540
university we're not stealing your money

2277
02:09:19,219 --> 02:09:25,610
in university we work a lot this

2278
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:28,200
presentation is taken

2279
02:09:25,610 --> 02:09:31,170
meet time and there are some times I

2280
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:33,320
leave work at 3:30 a.m.

2281
02:09:31,170 --> 02:09:36,450
so that week I could have this

2282
02:09:33,320 --> 02:09:39,210
presentation ready if I've been paid to

2283
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:44,790
come here no it's a pleasure for me to

2284
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:47,250
be here here the people and Alberto and

2285
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:50,610
contemporary University I would do it on

2286
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:54,210
behalf of anybody so please never ever

2287
02:09:50,610 --> 02:09:59,219
say to me the university doesn't do

2288
02:09:54,210 --> 02:10:01,590
sufficient because it's not true what

2289
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:04,950
you're saying is gonna be recorded and

2290
02:10:01,590 --> 02:10:07,230
I'm saying on Monday I may go to the

2291
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:11,510
rector and I'll say to the rector's look

2292
02:10:07,230 --> 02:10:14,129
what happened to me when I talk in a dog

2293
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:16,980
it's not so much that it's not done it's

2294
02:10:14,130 --> 02:10:19,230
more that we don't know about it but the

2295
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:21,209
fact that you don't know about it when a

2296
02:10:19,230 --> 02:10:23,400
university as a communication service

2297
02:10:21,210 --> 02:10:24,870

2298
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:26,670

2299
