1
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:27,028
when US adult hello everybody I'm the

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:29,829
first speaker and I'm nervous this is me

3
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,599
these are my social networks and

4
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:34,089
everything that my colleague just said

5
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,780
and the different conferences where I've

6
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:41,320
been presenting things oder navaja etc

7
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,690
and first of all I'd like to thank my

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,390
colleague Alfonso who's been helping me

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,010
out with all the conferences and growing

10
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:52,000
professionally in the area of security

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,680
etc but let's go let's get down to

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,189
business I'm gonna be speaking about

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:02,199
social networks free networks and the

14
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:08,380
ideas are based on the user's privacy

15
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:10,869
and there are many okay we're gonna go

16
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:15,579
into the problems of traditional social

17
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:20,020
networks as a microphone traditional

18
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:24,100
problems like toxicity Commons addiction

19
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,569
so therefore what solutions have people

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,678
implemented in order to be able to

21
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:33,159
communicate we have different solutions

22
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:35,649
micro blogging blogs and water

23
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,420
conclusions can we draw from this and

24
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,969
what measures can we put in place in

25
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,539
order for these social networks not to

26
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:45,639
end up disappearing so what do we

27
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:47,560
understand what do we mean by a social

28
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,359
network on that first in the first

29
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,020
country or in the first place we have

30
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:55,208
platform Facebook etc and then a social

31
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,340
network which is a whole structure of

32
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:59,560
people who want to communicate this is

33
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:03,569
really important and we need to

34
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:08,580
understand this very well and the first

35
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:11,290
problems which you see is toxicity and

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,780
messages in any social networks like

37
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,500
today you can not send messages without

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:22,910
offending anybody and some people write

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:28,989
negative offensive messages

40
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:34,310
this leads to a very mean atmosphere and

41
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:36,110
there's a couple of networks that are

42
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,080
trying to make sure that people would

43
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,360
not write anything that just comes out

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,920
of the blue because you may hurt people

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,519
you may some people may feel offended or

46
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,829
there's also threats etc so I summarize

47
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,319
this by saying that there is a lot of a

48
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:57,489
toxicity you may complain but without

49
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:03,920
offending anybody without meaning

50
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:06,620
offense for anybody the next thing that

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,140
I wanted to talk about is addiction this

52
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,890
happens in free social networks and in

53
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:16,268
conventional networks you try and

54
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:19,069
compare yourself and make sure that

55
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:22,670
you're better than everybody else when

56
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:24,349
you see something somebody in the know

57
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,809
social network and you don't know what's

58
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:29,540
going on you want to connect to it

59
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,340
everybody wants to go in and see what it

60
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,890
looks like so there's a lot of

61
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:42,079
fluctuation of users many come and go so

62
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:43,518
network grows then it drops shrinks and

63
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,019
it's not like when people create

64
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,720
accounts and they just leave them there

65
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:52,160
and another thing that I wanted to say

66
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,109
is that since people try and compare

67
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,900
themselves this may generate depression

68
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,150
anxiety you need to use them you need to

69
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,100
be online all the time and these are

70
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,019
happens with conventional and free in

71
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,739
networks and then there's a whole issue

72
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:08,510
of censorship there's bad sort of

73
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:10,639
censorship which is the whole platform

74
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,519
as it's happening in many countries with

75
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,039
Facebook YouTube Twitter and there are

76
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,260
some associations that are trying to

77
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:21,620
make sure the internet will be free but

78
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:23,450
like I said this censorship is about any

79
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,910
you need to communicate you're gonna

80
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,460
start seeing alternatives and the best

81
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,810
thing is to know what they are instead

82
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,580
of having them there and just block them

83
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,250
and having people look for other

84
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,200
channels that you won't know this is why

85
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,000
I believe that this censorship makes a

86
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,919
no sense because people are gonna keep

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,080
on communicating and there's another

88
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,880
sort of censorship which is more

89
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,099
interesting and which has to do with the

90
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,770
contents especially with pornography

91
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:54,270
with x-rated things and then there are

92
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:59,609
some strange channels like kid who had

93
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:03,310
hormone problem with one nipple one

94
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,310
female breast and a male breast and one

95
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,010
of his nipples or breast only one of

96
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:11,979
them were censored so we see problems

97
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:14,500
like this and there are places you can

98
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:17,860
resort to you when your contestant is

99
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:20,770
censored for instance showing a pregnant

100
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,880
women something that is nice but others

101
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:29,169
believe that this should be censored in

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:32,830
any case these these are things we can

103
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:37,000
use and also the issue of money the

104
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:39,880
content in advertising if you use a

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,100
LinkedIn it will say sign up for this

106
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,950
master's course but and everything's

107
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:47,080
like commercial and there are some

108
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:50,169
solutions that say you have a platform

109
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,909
where you can upload your data and let

110
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:59,820
the media use them yes so Dean so this

111
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:03,220
is done with bitcoins or cryptic points

112
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,039
you can give your data but not to a

113
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,500
specific company but to our platform so

114
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,599
that people may use them and then we see

115
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:14,050
changes in the price we see more and

116
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,389
more data so that prices go down in the

117
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,900
old days you could say your data for 60

118
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:21,940
$70 and then they're worth cents

119
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,888
the only thing was this is that there

120
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,350
are more people more data are generated

121
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,450
so obviously there's going to be this

122
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:33,220
drop in prices what I'm going to tell

123
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,900
you is an introduction of why but in

124
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,330
this presentation we're going to see how

125
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,679
people try to look for alternatives

126
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,000
because of the problems we've seen

127
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,340
before an interesting thing is that they

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,930
you need to keep existing we cannot

129
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,890
avoid accessory or addiction but

130
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,560
monetizing is something that doesn't

131
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,050
appear anywhere a social network doesn't

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,710
keep your data doesn't solve and doesn't

133
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,210
use them because because this is based

134
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,159
on the fact that everybody will set up

135
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,020
on their own a social network and you

136
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,500
can sign up or create your own if you're

137
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,200
not interested in this well so they are

138
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,120
free there's no company back in them

139
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,090
they're all independent projects the

140
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,210
only problem this is a scalability

141
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,039
because it so happens that when there

142
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,930
are many users you'll realize that this

143
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,000
is a good solution for them and that

144
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:27,419
they like the way they can communicate

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,990
with smaller groups and so people start

146
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:38,090
signing up and then this platform there

147
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,090
are too many users it simply won't hold

148
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:53,940
is that the manager who ministry who

149
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:56,610
says the limits you see what happens

150
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,060
when you allow our users to just do

151
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:02,210
whatever they want in free to act and

152
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,430
this is just a summarize of all the

153
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,500
different social free social network so

154
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,169
we've been analyzing together with

155
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:21,180
Alfonso like I said

156
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:23,400
and Twitter was created the first part

157
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,289
has to do with micro blogging and the

158
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:30,090
rest will be blogging or enriched

159
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:35,718
blogging protocols etc and this is the

160
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:39,149
protocol on this slide and URL it's very

161
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,699
well set up and here you can see the

162
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,380
whole ecosystem of free social networks

163
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:46,229
and depending on the protocols some of

164
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,439
them into relating to communicate and

165
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,570
you see our messages are sent from one

166
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,389
to another these are based on the

167
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,500
distribution they also have their it

168
00:08:54,389 --> 00:09:00,329
towards me in soccer supporting

169
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:03,029
connective a connector you don't need to

170
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:06,199
be a specific one in order to see the

171
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:10,670
messages that are going back and forth

172
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:10,670
first of all there's a conciliation tree

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,690
well this is just to give you an idea of

174
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,260
the whole ecosystem that exists here's

175
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:29,820
the red fairy verse and this is based on

176
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:32,100
microblogging different servers that can

177
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,190
generate messages and you allow them to

178
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,230
be to communicate and regardless of

179
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,390
where you're registered you can see

180
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,540
other people's messages are as long as

181
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:45,120
they share the protocol or their status

182
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,819
so here you can see the muffed and we're

183
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,709
seeing here is all the social free

184
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,910
social networks and the largest

185
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:58,229
employment is the one we have here which

186
00:09:53,910 --> 00:10:01,110
is master the one that is more used is

187
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,540
more broadly used as master than it

188
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,120
started being used in Japan very much

189
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,519
there's very trendy

190
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,720
you can send messages that would be

191
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,949
censored by other social networks so

192
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,980
let's assume there were like five

193
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:23,758
hundred thousand users in order to make

194
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,579
sense out of all of this there is master

195
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:31,680
then there's quit another smaller one

196
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:33,660
but this is the whole universe and this

197
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:46,138
is where we have the big one which is

198
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:49,589
mastered and then G etc etc so this

199
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:52,709
research been going on for a year and we

200
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,749
started with Macedon because we saw that

201
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:57,268
there were many problems with security

202
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:59,279
and we wanted to expand it because if

203
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:03,569
you try and understand a master Dan

204
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:09,720
right from a scratch you need to go to G

205
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:21,480
new social new social and this is based

206
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:26,429
on messages are generated projects are

207
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,740
based Federation you look for a list

208
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:30,420
list where you can amass hang of the

209
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,089
problem with this is that this is also

210
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,740
when they look for instances many of

211
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,529
them are no longer there because people

212
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,779
have moved to another level other

213
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,550
instances or another social network

214
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,720
there's another interesting thing you

215
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,748
know we can't quit it

216
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,579
would have been good sweetie and

217
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:49,740
everybody has their instance and is

218
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:52,920
based on the language if I speak Spanish

219
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,679
or Catalan or whatever so this way you

220
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,189
people can communicate with our problems

221
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,439
and

222
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,270
and but an important problem with this

223
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,350
is that can we see what is being

224
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,390
prejudiced all the messages that are

225
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,210
going back and forth can I read them can

226
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:14,590
I see them basically yes because there's

227
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:18,370
no authentication protocol but in any

228
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:20,380
case there's a limit you cannot see the

229
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:24,130
first twit that appear but in this case

230
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,500
you can messages are sequential so that

231
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:31,260
you can look up all these messages in

232
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:34,390
different instances do some mapping and

233
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:51,480
well this has been open for two years

234
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:51,480
and you can look at the messages saving

235
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:08,949
millions so you can you can find out

236
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:11,439
well all the users whether they're

237
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,900
administrators because the first thing

238
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:20,400
is to sign up as usual become the

239
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:23,250
administrator to the first see no

240
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:40,780
problem - the problem with

241
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:43,710
authentication we see that with g1 s and

242

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:23,378
will fit in different content you don't

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:29,769
move the user is behind whatever you are

248
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:34,629
discussing there see you can see what

249
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:40,209
everybody is saying with this because

250
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:45,239
depending on what you say you may get in

251
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:48,339
trouble messages and users in quitter

252
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:50,589
this is easy you create an account you

253
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,720
send a message and then you have the

254
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,149
idea at the level of the last user on

255
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,979
the last message so you go back and you

256
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:02,079
simulate the maximum amount of users as

257
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:06,869
you have an idea rough idea of how many

258
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:12,478
users or how many messages I need to

259
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:12,479
pick in order to have my own databases

260
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,330
type of blocking or delays or anything

261
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:36,090
for days yes it is 40 million you have

262
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:39,569
to buy one repetition per second have

263
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:42,900
you do it one month from the house all

264
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,880
the users on a network in four days is a

265
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,800
very interesting thing a possibility so

266
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,800
let's send the one to master on which is

allows for constant warning and they can

00:16:42,810 --> 00:17:06,220
fix messages there's advertising cleaner

271
00:16:52,960 --> 00:17:08,829
it's a pure what do you connect the more

272
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,230
widely used and those that are censored

273
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:15,208
if you have one you don't want to

274
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,209
receive those messages siempre es porque

275
00:17:15,390 --> 00:18:00,220
allows hatred pretty no graffia just

276
00:17:27,810 --> 00:18:02,800
scan these messages just examples

277
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,440
doesn't matter what you like you'll find

278
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,720
it there if you want to find a group of

279
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:13,930
people who like the things you like you

280
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:21,160
can security problems can you monitor

281
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:23,110
messages or users generated by GNU

282
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,320
there's no limitation you can see the

283
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:28,600
message is one by one or 1440 you can

284
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,929
here you can pick a group of messages

285
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,540
for two messages for instance

286
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,950
and you can do all this in four days

287
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,170
instead of a year there's no

288
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,250
authentication know everything etcetera

289
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:43,980
so rough this is a very small instance

290
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,770
for instance and this allows you to see

291
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:52,020
all the existing relations or the

292
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:54,389
mapping what users who talks to whom how

293
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:58,680
many I can see how many messages you've

294
00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:00,690
sent you can do a whole map it's

295
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,290
possible to do it in small scale you can

296
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:07,470
not do the whole network real-time you

297
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:11,730
can make your network grow for instance

298
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:14,820
they're using key words a power of

299
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,620
whatever people are interested in and

300
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,870
you may say well I'd like to know what's

301
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:23,810
being discussed here and it's a free all

302
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,810
you need to do is to just get in and

303
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:32,220
this you uh start stalking you can

304
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,830
create all the users that I deem

305
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,290
necessary if I want to come 2000 users

306
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:40,020
in just a petition to get the

307
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:44,070
authentication token I send a post to

308
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:50,400
the instance and in a sense we capture

309
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:54,090
it sends me a confirmation email you set

310
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,360
up your account and instead of creating

311
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:59,520
an instance I put the whole listing of

312
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:03,179
1,400 instance then you create water

313
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,520
school the transversus of a user to the

314
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:09,210
same email account in all instances

315
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,780
instead of having a single user and you

316
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:18,559
can control 2,400 in only one just in

317
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:21,649
just one email address please

318
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:25,370
give me a camp child because there's a

319
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:26,389
problems never captured because it's not

320
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,379
difficult

321
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:38,630
oh so I made get in trouble is the issue

322
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:42,940
of fighting is interesting to be

323
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:46,130
validated so in these social networks

324
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,289
green tick in master the first and she

questions what you see is an icon if you

327
00:20:51,320 --> 00:21:01,730
read the FA use so with that win nobody

328
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,289
looks at it some people may believe that

329
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:10,909
this is a real account the president of

00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:13,700
the government for instance Private Eye

331
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:16,220
since nobody knows who's behind an

332
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:20,799
account like this could be anywhere

333
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:24,769
anybody so you could impersonate

334
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:30,500
somebody there's no technology that

335
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:34,010
allows you to control this issue because

336
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:38,990
of development problem for cannot please

337
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:41,600
kids or behave and so what if I want to

338
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:44,630
create accounts but not just not in all

339
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:50,029
the existing instances but to any users

340
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:52,840
in one same instance I need to check my

341
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:52,840
mailbox

342
00:21:53,139 --> 00:22:00,340
we have a junk mail for instance

343
00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:04,720
temporary one like yup mail I can create

344
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:11,230
all the users everyone so here I say

345
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:13,690
create hundred users and just a matter

346
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,279
of minutes and users you can have but

347
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:23,769
there are tokens you can do anything you

348
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:27,119
can do messages or so masteren just

349
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:32,259
allowed you to erase to get rid of users

350
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:35,889
developers said you just to go into the

351
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:40,919
database and europe race them my hand

352
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:40,918
but there's no tool to wipe them all

353
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,529
[Music]

354
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,399
especially for inactive non active users

355
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:56,259
because some people just try out the

356
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:59,889
technology and they just leave the most

357
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:02,019
famous in social and everyone to know

358
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:06,928
why you're blocked because not everybody

359
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:09,129
can fit in 700,000 and if your

360
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:18,899
generators and users you can attend a

361
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:18,899
service and if you per se or 200 2400

362
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:25,830
transversal users

363
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:35,500
if you have advertisements in the web -

364
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:42,610
tossing their messages this is like any

365
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:44,470
other socially appears a few seconds

366
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,929
because it keeps us scrolling down

367
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,550
because people keep sending messages to

368
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:54,760
the messages and stay there

369
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:59,290
fixed so for instance in the 2400 people

370
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:03,270
when I sent the click or just once was

371
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:06,520
seen once 10 seconds maybe you could

372
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:09,639
visualize it viewers see it for a second

373
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:22,810
but seventy four hundred forty seven

374
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:28,300
hundred people that it's very difficult

375
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:30,730
to control and finally example there was

376
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,970
this other example with cover channel

377
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:37,090
there was an instance and this is for

378
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:41,020
real they would use the dolphin language

379
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:44,530
and there's no joke so we set up a

380
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,710
coding in order to send coded messages

381
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:50,139
using this so we could send this kind of

382
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:52,480
message using this kind of coding it was

383
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,030
kind of cool because people didn't know

384
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,900
what is going behind the scenes and you

385
00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:01,540
can use this sort of channels in order

386
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,490
to exchange information you just use an

387
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:06,760
instance with a lot of activity and send

388
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:10,410
the messages through that way so this is

389
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:15,250
the micro-blogging network feed I varies

390
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:17,080
as you know the micro-blogging instances

391
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:19,630
need to use captures because otherwise

392
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:23,590
they're in big trouble then we have pump

393
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:26,290
IO which is kind of different they don't

394
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:30,070
consider themselves as micro bloggers

395
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:32,260
they are group based then there is the

396
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:34,929
activity pub and activities drink

397
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,650
protocols that are also used by Twitter

398
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,250
and Facebook

399
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,880
it's all based

400
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:45,200
on exchanging messages subscribing to a

401
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:48,680
message feed it all has the same basis

402
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,170
so you subscribe to a list and you don't

403
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:55,070
have a general feed you just have a

404
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:58,460
group of users and decide which messages

405
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:01,580
you want to watch and you are sent only

406
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,670
those kind of messages that is different

407
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:07,699
from all the messenger applications you

408
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:10,700
know that are totally different in this

409
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,210
case are very few users very few

410
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:16,640
instances this wind hasn't been really

411
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:20,600
successful and the number of users has

412
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:25,430
gone down from 170,000 to only 20,000

413
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:28,399
this is also based on status net and but

414
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:31,880
in this case it went somewhere else they

415
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,060
used the Corps they edited it and they

416
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,470
set up this social network as you can

417
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,530
see there are very few instances

418
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,750
published there are two different things

419
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,610
when you create an instance you want

420
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,610
people to know about that instance and

421
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,620
to get logged in case you want to have

422
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:52,250
people talking about a particular topic

423
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:54,139
but then you can create an instance that

424
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:56,810
you don't want people to know about and

425
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:59,590
you just want a few number of users

426
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:04,220
talking about that and here you can find

427
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:07,909
dirty dirty things and that well very

428
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:10,820
nice thing saying so as I would say in

429
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:13,850
the row groups in Catalan and Galician

430
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,649
language and spammers when you subscribe

431
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,730
to one of these groups you know merle is

432
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,030
one that what they are going to be

433
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,760
talking about it's no surprise even if

434
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:26,510
it's free it's it that doesn't mean that

435
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:30,050
they are not organized people are

436
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:33,230
actually a lot better organized than in

437
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:37,700
twitter there is this phonic group

438
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:41,450
called Pirates of Galatia and in Spanish

439
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:44,780
you have open off that is about

440
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:46,580
programming when it comes to login there

441
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,639
is no cap channel

442
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,559
you know that in some cases you have

443
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,980
email axes and others you don't in

444
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,629
others the proces is closed so starting

445
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,950
up an account isn't as simple as it

446
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:03,890
looks like when it is closed it lets you

447
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:08,600
derive the authentication to or the pump

448
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:09,980
io servers so you don't need to have an

449
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,100
account you can have an account

450
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,740
somewhere else use that account for

451
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,918
example the one with data mass you can

452
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,690
use that one you can go to the

453
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:26,389
authentication step and start sending

454
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:29,929
messages using copy channel etc the

455
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:32,449
authentication is derived so for example

456
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:34,100
think if you have Instagram and LinkedIn

457
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:38,510
you don't need to authenticate yourself

458
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:41,029
in both you authenticate yourself in one

459
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:42,740
and behind the scenes you can use that

460
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:47,330
account in order to use the applications

461
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:49,880
of any of them the authentication is

462
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:52,279
just in one place and you can create

463
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,580
your profile instance have your

464
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:59,149
credentials there and then the rays and

465
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:01,250
authentication derivation this is quite

466
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:03,739
interesting and I think it should be

467
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:07,519
looked at because it is quite a good

468
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,250
solution for authentication issues when

469
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,789
it comes to authentication and Twitter

470
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:17,659
and Masterton Pompeo you can list the

471
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:19,639
number of users you can create Maps you

472
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:21,590
can see how they are related among

473
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:23,629
themselves and in this case you need

474
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,120
authentication in order to know what

475
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,159
your who your users are there's this

476
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,889
application that I share with all your

477
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,299
users on a panel so you don't have to do

478
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:39,229
anything you connect to this URL and you

479
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:41,600
just the users you have on that social

480
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:44,139
network in you you can see how many

481
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,320
users you have et cetera without

482
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:51,399
creating programs

483
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,590
Asian was as I was saying the network is

484
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:57,720
small and as I said it has several

485
00:29:53,590 --> 00:30:01,959
problems and we have finally hoop Zilly

486
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:05,620
Zilly and diaspora share the same

487
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:10,290
protocols this project that we can see

488
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:15,310
there are Federation it's made up for

489
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:17,649
GDU diaspora Zilla and social home but

490
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:22,690
they aren't not balanced in terms of

491
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:27,820
user numbers basically we have this list

492
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:30,370
just based on the fact that everything

493
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:34,000
is known and published you have all the

494
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:38,560
listings with instances you can see how

495
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,250
many active users you have so if you are

496
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:45,730
into monitoring data and knowing the

497
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:48,910
issues that are discussed you can find

498
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:52,000
all the data here you know how many

499
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:55,420
people are currently active and you get

500
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,620
yearly summarized information however

501
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,750
here you can get that kind of

502
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:02,320
information for free because they want

503
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:03,940
these networks to be known so diaspora

504
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,409
is actually the one that's been more

505
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:13,300
successful it has six hundred and fifty

506
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:17,620
three thousand users whereas friend

507
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:20,649
dykey and social home and Zillah aren't

508
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:23,500
as successful because they haven't

509
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:27,040
created the need of knowing the social

510
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:29,410
network and connecting to it all the

511
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:31,570
data are available as I was saying and

512
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,730
if you want to analyze what's going on

513
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:37,270
in these social networks you just have

514
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:43,420
to log in and start working on it

515
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:46,450
bobzilla only has 480 users but it's

516
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:49,270
really cool and it was supposed to be

517
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:53,090
very successful however it wasn't it's

518
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:55,039
quite similar to Facebook

519
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,309
when it comes to the panel and the

520
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,830
organization on the website it uses just

521
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:03,289
a few nodes there were more there are

522
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:06,019
more and more users but it's not really

523
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:07,820
becoming a success the reason why is

524
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:10,399
maybe people don't know about it or they

525
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:12,970
prefer diaspora or other kinds of

526
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:19,070
interfaces I thought it was interesting

527
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:22,309
anyway they have 430 users and I said

528
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:25,340
but they only have 30 nodes that's quite

529
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:28,158
surprising but here you can see the list

530
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,139
where you can connect and there are many

531
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,960
different versions people create an

532
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:35,689
instance get connected and they decide

533
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,909
to use that instance or using all the

534
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,309
one but in the end of the day there

535
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:43,159
aren't any large numbers in terms of

536
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:45,379
users the problem is the usual one no

537
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:48,620
capture so I can automate our eyes the

538
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:50,990
registration process they ask for your

539
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:55,309
email account so you have to confirm

540
00:32:50,990 --> 00:33:00,260
your email address but still there is no

541
00:32:55,309 --> 00:33:06,350
capture so I can create users massively

542
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:09,679
I can have my users stored and perform

543
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:12,260
massive spams whenever I want I can use

544
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,419
cava channel and have people connecting

545
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:20,000
between different social networks etc

546
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:23,659
here now we go to diaspora where they

547
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,490
talk about pods that they call the

548
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:28,909
instance in different ways in order to

549
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:32,080
make a difference but the idea is the

550
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:36,710
same independent people who are interact

551
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:40,639
this project starts in Kickstarter and

552
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:42,019
Mark Zuckerberg invested on it he

553
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:44,600
thought well this is interesting because

554
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:46,460
they are replicating what they do but I

555
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,820
don't want to go too far from them just

556
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:54,649
in case they start using it I might need

557
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:56,389
to get back and say to them ok gave you

558
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:57,129
money know that you start off so now

559
00:33:56,389 --> 00:34:00,469
guys

560
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:02,360
so they started in 2010 and their goal

561
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,600
is literally

562
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:08,449
to create facebook without using your

563
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,819
data that is I want to create a platform

564
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:12,859
with the same facilities that Facebook

565
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:15,260
has but I want to make money with your

566
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:17,418
data I want to do things differently

567
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:21,889
etcetera but they are looking for

568
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:25,460
publicity tracking recommend purchases

569
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:29,659
etc it's free and it's a smaller number

570
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:32,599
of people they want to continue with

571
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:34,280
this idea of sharing and work in the

572
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:41,659
same way as the Facebook but they want

573
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:45,109
to have a different business model as

574
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:47,629
per the notes all over the world you can

575
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:50,000
see them on a map they have two hundred

576
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,719
and seventy five the number of messages

577
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,460
is growing but when you look at the

578
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,830
history of active users you can see

579
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:00,740
there is a peak in 2015

580
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:04,130
I've been looking for information and I

581
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:07,819
really haven't found the exact figure

582
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:10,760
but my intuition is that in the social

583
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:14,480
network they don't want to have zombies

584
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,000
or inactive users so after a while if

585
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,300
the network hasn't been used these users

586
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:26,480
are just deleted this way they avoid

587
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:30,440
congestion or problems so in that point

588
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,030
in 2015 they decided to get rid of all

589
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,420
the users who hadn't used the

590
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:38,119
application in two months because it was

591
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:42,050
impossible otherwise half of the

592
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:44,900
messages here in freedivers come from

593
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:47,930
diaspora in this case the difference is

594
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,330
that we have the Capuchin diaspora said

595
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,520
let's do things right the project is

596
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:54,500
very good and we need to use capture

597
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,990
because authentication works a lot

598
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,520
better with kappa chats and that is very

599
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:00,919
good they also asked for your email

600
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:05,210
address and once you've created your

601
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:08,230
account the metadata of all the pictures

602
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:11,839
videos and things you upload are

603
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:13,220
automatically erased by default they

604
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,680
just get rid of them

605
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,779
and they give you the option of sharing

606
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,868
those data if you wanted they allow you

607
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:24,070
to connect to other social network so

608
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:26,810
this means that this project is working

609
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:29,599
well if you take a look at the capture

610
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:33,190
you can see that this is not a Google

611
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:38,869
like capture this is maybe ten years old

612
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:42,890
if you go to Linus the OCR gives you

613
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:47,750
tesseract and from an image you can pull

614
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:50,900
out the text that it has so what you can

615
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:53,570
see here is that from a URL you get a

616
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,630
hash that is the ID of the number and

617
00:36:53,570 --> 00:37:00,020
then a time and that time did nothing

618
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:02,510
that or made nothing but noise that

619
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:06,200
number didn't change every time I axed

620
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:09,710
access to the page so you can actually

621
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:13,640
remove this from the request and ask the

622
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:17,990
image without noise so what is what

623
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:23,690
about creating a program that pulls out

624
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:26,930
an image every time you use it you can

625
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:31,400
actually create very easily capture

626
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:33,440
database and crack those captures

627
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,010
because you can tell people whenever you

628
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,760
get this ID you will get this capture so

629
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:45,830
it's very easy to create as many users

630
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:49,670
as you want but if you have tesseract

631
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:53,060
that requires five digits with different

632
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:56,540
characters etc if you get rid of the

633
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,730
noise that's even easier so in 50% of

634
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:03,560
the cases you were right so every time

635
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:06,290
for every two requests one was right so

636
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:11,150
if you know about rappers and how to

637
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:13,279
surf on HTML you can request make this

638
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:16,970
request very easily and you can create

639
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,710
as many accounts as you want when it

640
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,810
comes to the contents

641
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:25,040
this is the interface these are the

642
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:28,339
posts and the question is do they use

643
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,920
sequential IDs for all the comments so

644
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:34,609
that I can list all the users and

645
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,420
comments with G and a master don't or

646
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:39,410
pump IO

647
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:43,510
the answer is yes if I use the first ID

648
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:47,750
the one that is hello diaspora as alpha

649
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:51,290
if I use that very first one it is seven

650
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:54,950
years old so I can set up my program

651
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:58,250
from number nine on and then with the

652
00:38:54,950 --> 00:39:00,259
join diaspora instance I can see

653
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,330
absolutely all the messages in this

654
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:07,369
social network pretty interesting isn't

655
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:10,160
it so the way I see it is that if I

656
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:11,900
would like to know what was the first

657
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,759
what the first message on Twitter was

658
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,680
it's impossible because it isn't stored

659
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,900
but here it is stored you can see the

660
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,779
subjects of discussion you can see also

661
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,030
statistics that come from the instance

662
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:30,109
itself you can see absolutely everything

663
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:34,310
that is very good and there are no

664
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:38,259
limitations in terms of ap I when I tell

665
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:41,299
you that you can create a list the IP

666
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:43,460
isn't going to change there is no

667
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,250
control whatsoever so that's where the

668
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,660
problem is if they are sequential and I

669
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:53,960
don't need to predict anything I just

670
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:57,618
can make a list you can see that the ID

671
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:02,359
is a hash and in this case you cannot

672
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:04,490
list the social network that doesn't

673
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:07,759
allowed you to know who all the users in

674
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:09,589
this network are because every time a

675
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,220
new user was created a new number was

676
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:15,589
created as this one here you can look up

677
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,930
for them by name but it's more complex

678
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:22,190
it's easier maybe when you try to look

679
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:27,129
for administrators by looking for people

680
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:30,560
who have admin in their usernames but

681
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,940
you cannot look for all the users that

682
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,359
were created

683
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:38,750
this is something that is under control

684
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:41,869
by them services so summarize this is

685
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:44,089
the best of them all now for you to have

686
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:47,240
a better idea you can see that Master

687
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:50,058
Dan is the larger one and if you see the

688
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,680
blue line it is connected to G and you

689
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:54,140
and friend dykey

690
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,618
why because they share the same protocol

691
00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:00,259
from G and you we have status net fan

692
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:03,020
dykey then you go to diaspora that goes

693
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:07,160
back to fan dykey so this is what i was

694
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:09,650
talking about sharing a protocol if i

695
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,828
had a user in each of these social

696
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,990
networks i could create a channel to

697
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:17,450
federate the message and communicate

698
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:21,140
among themselves without network you

699
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:25,578
know in because you are talking to the

700
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:32,650
entire ecosystem at the same time in

701
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:33,770
summary networks aren't thought for

702
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,980
constant

703
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:39,490
privacy but for user privacy you can see

704
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,630
the entire content without

705
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:45,109
authentication you can list all the

706
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:48,309
users except for diaspora and there is

707
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:50,779
no control at all there is no API

708
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:54,500
limitation there is no limitation of

709
00:41:50,779 --> 00:41:57,109
time for example so you can create the

710
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,480
method that we just saw even bigger

711
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:03,740
because you can know how many users

712
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:09,319
there are how they are interrelated etc

713
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:12,288
etcetera the fising problem isn't it is

714
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:16,099
a serious one because if these networks

715
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:17,990
get a lot bigger I can use characters

716
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:21,200
that were successful in some social

717
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:24,229
networks and try to impersonate them I

718
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,240
can also use some malicious links as

719
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:29,890
well so this is all about the sign here

720
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:36,770
how do I do in order to control all this

721
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:39,288
how can I avoid impersonation because

722
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:42,430
this is not well thought in terms of

723
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:47,099
development when it comes to automatic

724
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:50,919
in the creation of you users you need

725
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:54,280
something you just need internet with

726
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:58,059
the exception of diaspora in diaspora if

727
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,819
you can use tesseract you can do it so

728
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:03,099
you can crack it every time you could

729
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:05,529
create as many counts as you wanted in

730
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:10,569
all the social networks that you would

731
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:13,809
want causing and DDoS in mustard and

732
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:20,349
this is even more serious because you

733
00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:22,869
cannot delete it you didn't have uses

734
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:26,470
one by one that's the most serious one

735
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:29,140
but in terms of contents you can perform

736
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,790
a total delegation and that is a problem

737
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,660
because they are all interconnected they

738
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:36,460
all federates

739
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:39,759
the messages because for example when

740
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,800
you are cracking Twitter you don't crack

741
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,740
Facebook and LinkedIn at the same time

742
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:47,290
but here you can you can crackle a

743
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:52,509
instances you can generate loads of

744
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:55,799
contents so I can actually bring the

745
00:43:52,510 --> 00:44:00,010
entire ecosystem down and leave a

746
00:43:55,799 --> 00:44:03,190
million users without service when it

747
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:06,069
comes to fising it's the same thing just

748
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,020
happen to deceive the administration

749
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:11,290
administrator because he's the only one

750
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:14,349
in control I have this funny story that

751
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:16,259
someone told to me that someone who

752
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:20,200
would follow a user with the spider

753
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:23,730
every time and people started realizing

754
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:29,890
that there was a spider following them

755
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:36,010
so I didn't want to be banned so what I

756
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:40,089
did was to say this but in another case

757
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:43,270
they they caught me and they banned the

758
00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:47,319
program that was scanning all the users

759
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:49,920
this is the same story with fising if i

760
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:52,829
make my message as real as

761
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,760
if the administrator doesn't know about

762
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:59,190
it I can reach more people with cover

763
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,609
channel there are many different ways

764
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:04,500
you can use it in the instance itself

765
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:10,710
you can set up a cover channel with one

766
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:13,020
single instance with even in capital

767
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:15,150
letters and in small letters are the

768
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,700
only ones allowed and then you can

769
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:21,450
create an account with master done and

770
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:23,848
and all the one with diaspora if you

771
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:27,899
have the users inside the network's

772
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:30,030
acting as channels I can forward message

773
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,480
back and forth without people knowing

774
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:35,849
what's going on so this is a sort of

775
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,710
fising that cannot be detected the

776
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:39,809
problem is that the users have to know

777
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:43,319
each other you have to know the IDS of

778
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:46,109
people sending and receiving messages so

779
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:50,549
what are the countermeasures that can be

780
00:45:46,109 --> 00:45:53,220
used please use a chat it's for free and

781
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:56,339
they give you the code so use it because

782
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,609
all the wise me or somebody else can

783
00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:01,170
just create when 100,000 users

784
00:45:58,609 --> 00:46:05,578
another factor I don't know if they have

785
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:08,119
this and diaspora but most of these

786
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:11,970
networks don't have a second factor

787
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:15,780
there are no other controls when it

788
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:19,770
comes to sequential ideas it's important

789
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:23,609
to have you and not to having them you

790
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:26,819
can go from 1 to 100 thousand and cover

791
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:28,920
all the users and the network the same

792
00:46:26,819 --> 00:46:31,950
in diaspora don't use sequential

793
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:34,410
messages because I will be able to

794
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:36,750
gather as much as much information as

795
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:39,868
possible then you need to authenticate

796
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:43,619
all the requests you cannot allow a

797
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:47,670
company using your social network you

798
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:54,420
know the to send their newsletters with

799
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:56,609
their own subscript one using this

800
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,990
social network can see what all you are

801
00:46:56,609 --> 00:47:00,090
talking about because you don't need to

802
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:03,549
login

803
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:07,090
finally the api's need to be limited

804
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:12,340
this is a basic thing otherwise it will

805
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:19,000
grow and till it bursts if you cannot

806
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:22,870
handle more well he in this case you can

807
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:29,010
use as many requests as you want as long

808
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:32,650
as the machine allows for it you are

809
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:35,170
stocking people and creating many many

810
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:38,110
many accounts you can bring the Machine

811
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:40,480
down even if it doesn't look like it I

812
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,160
like these free social networks although

813
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,260
it looks like they are going to fall

814
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,940
apart they are good and they are a good

815
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,100
alternative when you get tired of

816
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:51,400
LinkedIn Facebook Twitter all the

817
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:55,060
advertising and all the messages that

818
00:47:51,400 --> 00:48:00,040
are constantly criticized I like this

819
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:02,460
alternative it's easier to connect and

820
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:07,450
to have normal conversations and

821
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:10,990
according to your likes you have an

822
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:16,629
instance not for you for example there

823
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:19,029
is an instance about Game of Thrones if

824
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:26,470
you are into that security is an

825
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:29,440
important thing it's very serious that G

826
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:31,810
and you and Status net haven't done

827
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,510
anything for several years they need to

828
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:35,950
use capture and many other things and

829
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,730
this is an important source of

830
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:44,890
information for us analysis if you want

831
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:48,190
to find messages in order to test you

832
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:50,830
can use these networks in order to get

833
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:53,350
Massachusetts and do your analysis and

834
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:56,920
your analytics another important point

835
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:59,770
is that there is no censorship on these

836
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,480
networks they are controlled by the

837
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,430
administrators and when I started

838
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,950
investigating about these networks I who

839
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:08,440
is trying to look for a group talking

840
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:09,669
about dangerous things in order to find

841
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,910
out what happens

842
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:24,010
when they are talking about dangerous

843
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:27,790
things so what you find is that there

844
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:30,579
are no offensive messages the minute

845
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:35,170
there's somebody who wants to insult

846
00:49:30,579 --> 00:49:37,089
somebody else through message people

847
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:40,290
just send that message to the

848
00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:46,808
administrator and that user is banned

849
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:49,180
people are a lot more sensible here one

850
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:51,819
may think that because this is free

851
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,759
people are going to be watching porn and

852
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:57,220
saying terrible things all the time but

853
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,170
it's not like that they like to do

854
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:02,529
whatever you want but you you don't do

855
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:05,849
that kind of thing because you give the

856
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:08,319
social networks their real use that is

857
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:10,630
communication so it's interesting to

858
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,420
think about why people aren't using

859
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:15,700
these social networks in order to post

860
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:17,710
things that cannot be post on Twitter

861
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,950
that's the interesting thing they are

862
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:24,760
more respectful communities they are not

863
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:29,410
so interested in conflict and

864
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:31,329
confrontation so that's what I had to

865
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:35,348
say I finished a little bit early maybe

866
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:38,500
I was speaking too fast but well I can

867
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:40,119
now answer any questions that you may

868
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:43,109
have if you're interested in knowing

869
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:43,109
more about anything

870
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:57,080
yes I tell you livin your superhub lo

871
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:59,700
estoy so if I'm registered in master

872
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:10,440
could i register within a note in

873
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:13,350
diaspora yes is diaspora Asterix social

874
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:16,290
network and they don't share the same

875
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:18,930
status with master ins so what you can

876
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,850
do is use the same email account to be

877
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:23,310
in master learn and diaspora at the same

878
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:24,690
time but you cannot derive the

879
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,590
authentication I think that's what

880
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,860
you're talking about

881
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:32,990
so what I am proposing is or what I'm

882
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:35,760
saying is that G and you and have Zilla

883
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:38,640
well you could create a boat a user

884
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,880
there so that every time you use mustard

885
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,480
on that message is sent over to diaspora

886
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,670
so that the entire network is federated

887
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:51,030
so you would use master and only and all

888
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:57,480
the messages would be federated in the

889
00:51:51,030 --> 00:52:00,120
social networks the ones that have the

890
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:03,630
same protocol they just reach a certain

891
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:05,009
level if the instance is federated

892
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:08,820
you're going to watch the same thing in

893
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:12,570
both in both social networks but if you

894
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:15,570
also use GNU you can use it in order to

895
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:17,850
be redirected to diaspora and I asked /

896
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:25,140
is great it is just Facebook without the

897
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:27,870
advertising actually the topic of being

898
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:30,240
automatically registered in diaspora was

899
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:34,850
a subject in diaspora itself it's really

900
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:38,669
cool did you know about Masterton

901
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:40,920
masteren is pretty well-known but what

902
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:44,850
about diaspora or pom piyo

903
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:48,510
GNU as the oldest one it is more

904
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:53,700
old-school I don't know if you've ever

905
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:54,800
heard of the free social networks no so

906
00:52:53,700 --> 00:53:00,189
thank you very much

907
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,189
[Applause]

908
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:04,200
muchisimas gracias merrily
