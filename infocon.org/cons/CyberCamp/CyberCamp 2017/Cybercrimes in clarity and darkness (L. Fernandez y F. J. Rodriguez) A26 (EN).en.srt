00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,720
[Applause]

2
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,770
well I'm gonna cut that Otto and I can

3
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,659
up hello first of all like to thank for

4
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:36,190
cantata Canyon I mean they come you like

5
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:39,709
to thank you for inviting me this year

6
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:45,709
my colleague responsible for you see

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:47,050
their development area so what are we

8
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,649
going to see today

9
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:59,860
well we're gonna look at cyber crime

10
00:00:50,649 --> 00:01:02,960
detection in the daytime and nighttime

11
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:05,239
this is the Internet we know the two

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,509
sides of the same coin on the one hand

13
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:14,180
we have the surface web what we all use

14
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:17,210
work pleasure whatever and then we also

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:23,150
have the other side which known as

16
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:26,210
archaea and darkness and what we call

17
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,700
deep web and on both sides we see cyber

18
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,880
crimes and this is what we're going to

19
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:35,150
tell you of today precisely those

20
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,939
activities those recreational activities

21
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:43,009
that happen in these two sides of the

22
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:47,059
coin and how in in Seba we investigate

23
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:52,840
this crime and how we devote tools in

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:55,939
order to fight these criminal activities

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,720
very often we confuse our Terms

26
00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:01,309
ourselves as web deep web and dark web

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,520
and this is what I'd like to clarify

28
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,409
with these asteroids surface where my

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,079
father's

30
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:12,970
what an internet that are accessible and

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:17,739
that indexed with the main searches that

32
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:20,140
are engines that we use being Yahoo etc

33
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:24,519
and then the Deep Web that's accessible

34
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:26,920
but it's not indexed by these angels for

35
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:31,450
instance the content of your email

36
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:34,780
accounts or the information stored in

37
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,500
your corporate networks and finally in

38
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,069
dark web

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:43,480
what is restricted and non-indexed not

40
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:46,390
indexed because can access the content

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:51,640
of the neck itself so we need to use a

42
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:57,910
specific and specific web Freenet our

43
00:02:51,640 --> 00:03:02,440
clients or other so if we look at the

44
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:04,930
year 2017 we may highlight some events

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,840
such as everything that happened are

46
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,450
related to runs and when somewhere or

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,780
information leaks or issues related to

48
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,380
botnets and this is what my colleague is

49
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,690
going to start talking to you about

50
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,799
thank you very much I'm gonna tell you

51
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:26,200
about security issues that we've seen in

52
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,819
2017 and how they're related to the

53
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,310
subject we're treating them as to

54
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:35,980
whether they happen in daylight on the

55
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:38,680
surface web or the dark web let's begin

56
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,668
with a ransom aware I'm sure that you've

57
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,910
all heard about one a cry

58
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:49,959
petia etc and then other things that

59
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:54,269
last known but have also that have also

60
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:56,530
affected our companies and bank

61
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,440
institutions Eva those true that in

62
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:03,280
general they've affected Eastern

63
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,280
European countries mostly Russia what do

64
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,780
these run some away all this ransomware

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:15,320
a share

66
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:20,048
well the people that are managing these

67
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:23,630
this cybercrime trying to hide behind

68
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:26,419
anonymous networks network like toy here

69
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,690
we have examples of the typical panels

70
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,990
in order to rescue the files that have

71
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:39,770
been encrypted in computers and what

72
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:43,130
they share they're trying to have their

73
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,880
activities behind the internet this is

74
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:50,930
something that's happened in daylight in

75
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,659
clarity and they are hiding behind a

76
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:58,640
tool in order to hide next to the

77
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:02,230
anonymous e offered by these networks

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,940
and there's also the information leaks

79
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,520
every year more and more information is

80
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,300
being released from different sources we

81
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:18,020
have statistics a clear how since 2013

82
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:20,660
of 9 billion files have been leaked or

83
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,150
released from information systems or

84
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,890
they've been compromised and the true

85
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,020
problem here has to do with these

86
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:29,419
statistics we see underneath and that is

87
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,669
that only 4% of that information was

88
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:35,060
encrypted this means that the rest of

89
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:37,729
the information that was stolen was are

90
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,990
publicly accessible here we see the

91
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:43,919
evolution in 2005 2006 where we started

92
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:48,250
seeing lots of

93
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,469
left we see that these are balls will

94
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:55,560
start growing the amount of information

95
00:05:50,470 --> 00:06:00,040
that criminals are taking from companies

96
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,490
is increasing 2120 or 12 until we reach

97
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,200
an explosion in the last three years

98
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,580
where there's such an amount of

99
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:13,900
registers that they don't even fit in

100
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:16,450
net so much crime that we see but

101
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,880
they've also got a component of a deep

102
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,520
with a lot of information information

103
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,650
from my bank account and credit cards of

104
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,870
this information stored in the Deep Web

105
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:28,539
were through the network such as thought

106
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,270
that I'm sure you all know of and

107
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,090
something that we've seen this year is

108
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,909
the botnets you may say well this

109
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:42,900
there's no new malicious activity

110
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:46,600
because we've known about many years

111
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,299
things are shape things like Maury

112
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,700
Reaper

113
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,580
so they try to explain and exploit the

114
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:59,099
IOT Internet of Things right now we see

115
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:02,859
an exponential increase of Internet of

116
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,870
devices connected to the Internet and at

117
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,560
the end they are being compromised by

118
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:13,590
these botnets and as we know in the case

119
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,590
of my ray last year for instance

120
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:22,380
you know many companies Google etc were

121
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,890
affected and they can be used for any

122
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:29,460
attachment from spam campaigns malware

123
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:35,640
distribution attack how many different

124
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:37,830
organizations the DDoS attacks well see

125
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:43,409
them in the surface web but these cyber

126
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:46,109
crimes for in the Deep Web if we want a

127
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,540
DDoS attack all we need to do is to go

128
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:56,310
into one of those well-known thought

129
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:59,300
services and with a small price you can

130
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:06,780
buy these things were sort of cybercrime

131
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:11,000
appear in daylight so to speak surface

132
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,919
and that let me tell you about an

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,670
investigation that happened in the

134
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:22,770
summer 2017 because this is something

135
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:28,650
that I compared the light and this

136
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:31,859
affected dot s domains that is Spanish

137
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,579
domains the idea was we reach out to the

138
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,500
maximum number of users and I'm gonna

139
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,340
tell you about this investigation and

140
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,630
what it was about the origin well first

141
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:50,030
of all it tells you about a fraudulent

142
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:54,750
dot es domain that was impersonating a

143
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:57,839
famous Spanish brand this was in the

144
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:02,310
internet in the same platform and what

145
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,770
it does is to set up a virtual store and

146
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:10,439
the crime itself

147
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:12,600
theft of credit cards we we were doing

148
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,870
this research this investigation we

149
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,310
asked ourselves are there more as a dome

150
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,769
is that occurring

151
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,709
the same type of activity and that's

152
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:25,370
when we started doing parallel carrying

153
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:32,149
a different a parallel investigation

154
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:35,699
okay so out of the es domains so far

155
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:38,910
from out of all of them 11,000 we

156
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:43,859
started looking for deploy design cars

157
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:46,350
so we obtained 11,000 domains with a Zen

158
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,240
cart and we started pulling from that

159
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:55,529
and started comparing this with the

160
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:58,800
initial domain in the research some of

161
00:09:55,529 --> 00:10:04,290
these domains are detected with names

162
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:06,660
like for instance lawyer in marbella the

163
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:16,349
breeder dot yes I was

164
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:22,529
save and light Car Rental beauty and

165
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:25,350
health and our me.com dot s and police

166
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:29,040
online dot s these are just some of them

167
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:31,559
so the thing was what did they what did

168
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,740
all these domains share what do they all

169
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:38,490
have in common let's see for instance

170
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:41,670
our lawyer Mobilia sells some very

171
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:46,259
wonderful shoes with incredible

172
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:51,930
incredible discount 75% 80% discount and

173
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:54,389
if we move to the next one to add reader

174
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,519
that we all relate to a different sort

175
00:10:54,389 --> 00:11:06,269
of thing you can see some very nice

176
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:10,459
shoes also at very low prices ADSL free

177
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:16,230
eye DSL what do they do they sell

178
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:19,349
sunglasses sun shades Christmas time etc

179
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,250
so things are starting to become

180
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:27,899
suspicious

181
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:33,970
and for instance save in electricity

182
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:42,970
women's clothes with good sales car

183
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:50,610
rental shoes to restaurant El Cortijo El

184
00:11:42,970 --> 00:12:00,670
Cortijo restaurant snow equipment skis

185
00:11:50,610 --> 00:12:03,339
bags etc here they have different types

186
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:10,229
of material women's bathing suit

187
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:15,579
t-shirts etc mama dog come yes

188
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:18,069
sweatshirts and the last 109 police the

189
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:26,050
es watch are they gonna sell I sell

190
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:28,360
shoes so they're here it says there's

191
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:32,079
something that doesn't fit here and we

192
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,949
start and then investigating and the

193
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,589
first thing we say is who can

194
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:41,459
investigate this in Spain so from

195
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:45,370
anywhere in the world you can request on

196
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:50,018
domains as long as there's a links in

197
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:55,930
Spain for instance legal persons in

198
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:59,740
Spain or individuals or legal or in

199
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,349
person or individuals related culturally

200
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,600
speaking or socially speaking or

201
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,480
economically with Spain I didn't know

202
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,009
much about this so I wanted to look into

203
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,019
this and I wouldn't do answer the

204
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:12,879
following questions which are the legal

205
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:17,500
requirements in order to open up and

206
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:19,949
open an online store in Spain so here we

207
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,370
came up with a smaller group and

208
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:23,370
following the first

209
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:38,339
meet the law what you have to give

210
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:44,080
information such as name number of the

211
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:47,620
registry where the business is data

212
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,110
protection is a paranoia professional

213
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,320
ATO you know typical Rosario they don't

214
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,990
ecomo say yes to notify the user of

215
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,959
where these data are going to be stored

216
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:09,520
and other things like the famous cookies

217
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:12,849
a policy and secure payment legal things

218
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,980
so first of all we started doing this

219
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:20,260
manually and then we did it in an

220
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:23,860
automated way an automatic way to

221
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:32,410
analyze these domains and see if they

222
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:39,690
meet these are legal requirements name

223
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:39,689
of a company registry where it is

224
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:59,529
cookies policy was missing also privacy

225
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:08,170
policy was either non-existent or in

226
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:12,660
English or the wording was strange LLP D

227
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:17,099
nothing regarding where the information

228
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:20,130
taken from users or was stored legal

229
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:27,540
things nothing

230
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:32,700
and then payments procedure credit cards

231
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:38,160
and nothing about Sakura payment but

232
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:40,320
there was more to these sites affect

233
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,510
more brands not only Spanish one but

234
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:48,650
foreign ones many of which I'm sure you

235
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:54,930
know many of these domains were

236
00:15:48,650 --> 00:16:00,449
registered by five since who are

237
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:02,760
authorized that you register companies

238
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,830
in Spain and they all of these companies

239
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:15,480
said they had been registered by these

240
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:19,620
are five people ASM Istanbul you see the

241
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:23,910
open to these Naas ends energy I hosting

242
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:29,640
and also the ports twenty one twenty

243
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:36,839
five eighty a hundred and ten 3316 and

244
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:44,970
we also realized that the domains there

245
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:49,320
was subscriptions and all the signing

246
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:54,170
out always in different IP addresses

247
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:59,640
take into account the cost this entails

248
00:16:54,170 --> 00:17:01,260
some of these sites are presented our SS

249
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:05,849
services and with this we were

250
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:10,040
suspecting that there was a fraud many

251
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:16,050
of these email addresses were related to

252
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:18,659
fraudulent activities so the question

253
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,589
was who's behind all this who do you

254
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,659
think is behind all this

255
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:32,590
following question that we'll try and

256
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:35,960
answer I find this in these certificates

257
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:39,949
and that take us to this server when

258
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,500
starting to do the analysis we see China

259
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:45,950
right away start analyzing this and

260
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,899
apart from these are panels these

261
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:51,529
displays I don't know whether there's

262
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:56,840
worth 10,000 or 20,000 we also find the

263
00:17:51,529 --> 00:18:00,320
characters that made us start being

264
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,870
suspicious about the country that they

265
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:09,399
always came from when looking at

266
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:14,418
administrative contact we see these

267
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:19,639
different references Connor in 63

268
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:22,429
dot-com ye Annette Fox Mail calm and

269
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:26,719
many of them letters to Chinese domains

270
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:30,740
and many of which were fake addresses so

271
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,679
we started looking at the platform

272
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,539
security is there well since we you've

273
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,730
set up all this let's see if you've

274
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:42,440
really done a good job at least from the

275
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:45,399
point of view of security rescuers as

276
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:52,220
ice wise sql's

277
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:55,639
vulnerable addresses we start looking at

278
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:59,750
the mall and see a lot of a

279
00:18:55,639 --> 00:19:02,799
vulnerability the web server and Apache

280
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:05,389
that Tosa presents a lot of

281
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,620
vulnerability and why should we worry

282
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:13,760
why worry about security come on

283
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:16,518
so summarizing what do all these domains

284
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,669
are shared first of all they don't

285
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:21,890
comply with legal requirements name of

286
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:25,760
the product not

287
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:29,920
we're the product as such because they

288
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:36,950
will speak about shoes clothes just

289
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:39,830
driving unsubscribing the Ministry of

290
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:46,179
contact was a fake or the domain pointed

291
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:52,760
at an age as an Asian thing no digital

292
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:59,900
certificate in order to do to to do the

293
00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:05,330
purchase and here's the summary we

294
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:09,880
automate all this part of the 11000

295
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:15,889
domains we detected we see that 94% were

296
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:20,480
potentially malicious so we do did the

297
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:22,309
report in order to submit it to those

298
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,520
who are responsible for this but there's

299
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:27,559
always what if I pull from these

300
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,870
different ends what if I look into this

301
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:34,370
if I look into that and here comes the

302
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:38,000
surprise we start going into other

303
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:42,409
things and we find a server in the

304
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,049
internet server by these same people and

305
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,480
we see the structure of the directories

306
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:49,970
we have all the folders and within the

307
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:53,690
folders there is all these sub

308
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,860
directories with a zinc are about to be

309
00:20:53,690 --> 00:21:00,910
deployed ok

310
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:06,799
not only this but it was also file dot

311
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:09,530
zip and what was in it now let's look at

312
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,570
off along one Zen car this is what we

313
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:16,960
find once against reference to the same

314
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:30,450
thing ok and what did this file it had

315
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:30,450
fight like this payment payment dot XML

316
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:43,600
his you see all the structure of

317
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:46,450
complete directories files the CSV over

318
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,240
products of the store they changed them

319
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:52,630
change the names products everything

320
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,179
like I said earlier payment information

321
00:21:52,630 --> 00:22:10,000
information that domains once again

322
00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:13,539
China database Irvin you think a version

323
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,039
they had deployed was also vulnerable so

324
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:21,510
once we reach this point say all we need

325
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:46,779
I need a free to give me the passwords

326
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:51,659
yes so we get to the server they've set

327
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:51,659
up all the infrastructure for part of it

328
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:05,469
conclusions

329
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:08,168
finally we got of 11,000 domains that

330
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:11,200
commit fraud all the information

331
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:18,399
obtained was handed to the authorities

332
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:23,159
in order for them to act so conclusions

333
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:33,070
that nobody's free of being a victim

334
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:35,379
cyber criminals also make mistakes this

335
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,479
is something this detection something

336
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:40,509
that can be automated and this is what

337
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:47,259
we did and there's not only happens in

338
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:54,820
the dark areas Verrocchio on the surface

339
00:23:47,259 --> 00:24:01,919
more often than we suspected let's move

340
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:06,249
on to crime times in done in the dark

341
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:09,249
now let's move to the hidden Network

342
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:15,879
where we need a given client in order to

343
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:26,969
be able to have access once we know the

344
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:33,639
best door I to be the idea is to get

345
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:37,779
anonymity and privacy whenever we speak

346
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:39,998
about tor we always think about negative

347
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:43,119
things it seems that the whole criminal

348
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:47,320
activity focuses in a tour but what

349
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:51,519
happens in telegram or what's up who

350
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:56,139
uses a telegram who uses what's up okay

351
00:24:51,519 --> 00:25:01,809
so news like this things that have

352
00:24:56,139 --> 00:25:04,748
happened this year 50% gyro discounts in

353
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:06,399
stores like America Dona etc and the

354
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:09,100
idea was to

355
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:17,410
get information from users in order to

356
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:27,459
sell it or things like child sex abuse

357
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:30,700
and also ye hardest propaganda and it's

358
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,910
not just telegram because this expense

359
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:39,820
to the services will know Google+

360
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:45,700
Facebook Twitter YouTube by mere

361
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:49,649
assertion criminalized technology we

362
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:59,290
don't think we should make it illegal

363
00:25:49,650 --> 00:26:03,580
just because of an improper use made of

364
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:06,399
technology now we move on to tour and

365
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:10,360
hand the floor over to my colleague who

366
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:14,340
is now after the knife story that friend

367
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,570
told us about about surface

368
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:23,070
investigation I'm going to tell you

369
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:26,320
about stories in the dark web so what we

370
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:30,389
speaking of according to these

371
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:35,850
statistics we see that there are around

372
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:39,310
55 Orion caster services that have been

373
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:43,030
active and that is the figure that we

374
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:47,889
work with officially speaking and what

375
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:51,490
lies behind these active domains well

376
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:57,280
based on the analysis we carried out

377
00:26:51,490 --> 00:27:00,790
over more than 200,000 tor domains we

378
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:04,570
reach the conclusion that almost 75% of

379
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:07,330
those services hide web services just

380
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,939
like the ones that we can find on the

381
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:15,739
official web

382
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:20,869
the next we found where as Sh open

383
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:22,989
services and then residual share of them

384
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:28,600
which had to do with interests

385
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:31,249
instantaneous texting messages email

386
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:36,139
file-sharing services etc so this is

387
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:40,090
what tor is currently using so within

388
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:43,309
those 75% of services that are using tor

389
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:46,580
here we can see several examples of fora

390
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:50,658
that are pretty famous for example

391
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:54,559
Elysium was created in 2016 it lasted

392
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:57,340
less than a year because German agents

393
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:02,600
managed to close it because its main

394
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:03,408
subject was unfortunately sexual child

395
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,769
abuse

396
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:11,509
then there were famous markets such as

397
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:15,529
Silk Road or silk road abroad that were

398
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:18,230
closed by several international police

399
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:20,570
forces the spanish police forces have

400
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,929
collaborated the themes that the

401
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:29,889
subjects are very varied for example and

402
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:34,429
this one we have all sorts of drugs but

403
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:35,539
there are many other illegal activities

404
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:38,419
in tor

405
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:42,200
I don't want to demonize the technology

406
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:45,799
as Frank was saying but the truth is

407
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:52,220
that until we found all these sorts of

408
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:56,059
criminal acts sexual child abuse yeah it

409
00:28:52,220 --> 00:29:02,239
is propaganda sale of weapons sale of

410
00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:05,168
drugs and all sorts of people are using

411
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:08,480
the properties of toy that provides

412
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:12,259
anonymity in order to do this kind of

413
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,020
things these are some examples there are

414
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:18,570
many

415
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:22,460
and many services are only content

416
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:26,629
indexes since there are no Google style

417
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:29,940
search engines they have content indexes

418
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:35,270
so well we've blurred it a little bit

419
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,270
here in order to delete names and

420
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:49,040
sensitivities but the main subject in

421
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:53,120
these four are sex child abuse another

422
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:57,389
common thing in tor is the exchange of

423
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:01,770
content we have these examples these

424
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:04,590
Satoshi boxes that meet the supply and

425
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:07,139
the demand people want to sell for

426
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:09,959
example child pornography pictures that

427
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,110
may be of interest for some people so

428
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,690
they upload it to this platform they set

429
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:17,790
a prize in bitcoins and if people are

430
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:21,420
interested they just download it and pay

431
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:25,020
in bitcoins and this is what is

432
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,790
currently going on now in relation to

433
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:31,320
what I was saying in the beginning there

434
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:34,230
are many ransomware panels this is a

435
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:39,149
crime that takes place on the surface

436
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:42,690
and sure we've suffered as ransomware

437
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:47,990
attack at home or in our company and the

438
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:52,200
attackers actually meet and the tow web

439
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:55,350
in some cases even the web site is to

440
00:30:52,200 --> 00:31:00,240
say ransomware is becoming a service it

441
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:07,020
is now very easy so that you can create

442
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:10,500
your own ransomware panel you can get

443
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:13,020
information encrypted it's really simple

444
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,290
on the right here you have an example

445
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:21,360
and it's really scary to see how simple

446
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:24,389
it is there are other illicit activities

447
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,719
for example year it is propaganda

448
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:30,690
although this isn't the main means these

449
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,970
people use to disseminate their contents

450
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:35,880
as they use all the channels for example

451
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:39,320
telegram whatsapp and all the social

452
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:43,230
media here we can also find this kind of

453
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:45,750
information and there are markets as the

454
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:48,720
ones we saw before markets that sell all

455
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:53,700
sorts of drugs even referring to very

456
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:59,040
well-known brands sale of weapons there

457
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:03,110
are many fora on the subject and after

458
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:06,480
analyzing all these different subjects

459
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:10,379
we can't help my one but wonder who is

460
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:13,350
behind all these hidden services can we

461
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:18,900
really know who is behind these hidden

462
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:21,600
services well yes we can how how can we

463
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:24,720
approach this how can we locate cyber

464
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,659
criminals well we can follow the same

465
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,140
procedure as for these social website we

466
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:33,510
try to find human errors as people who

467
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,980
are operating these services are human

468
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,350
beings and therefore they can make

469
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,320
configuration mistakes and we can also

470
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:44,189
look for faults in the information

471
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,500
departments systems there are no hundred

472
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:50,250
percent secure information systems so we

473
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:54,140
can try to verify if the information

474
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:57,030
systems they are using vulnerable or

475
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:02,310
maybe we can even find exploits and

476
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:04,800
usually let's take a look at some D and

477
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:08,070
animation techniques that we've used in

478
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:12,590
some operations for example the first

479
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:17,429
one we can try to look for hidden

480
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:22,050
services that due to human mistakes have

481
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:25,680
been exposed both in the Tor net and in

482
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:28,800
these superficial web and if there has

483
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:31,830
been a connection we can use services

484
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:35,129
for example Soudan in order to find the

485
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:37,860
real IP where those services are located

486
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,870
and then we can report this to security

487
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,570
forces

488
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:45,559
thus in one particular location and we

489
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:49,550
were able to disclose a hidden service

490
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:52,100
provider that had more than 2,000 hidden

491
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:56,300
services and tour will reported this to

492
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:58,820
the police services and they are cut

493
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:04,610
them because it isn't technically too

494
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:08,418
complicated another technique that we

495
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:10,489
can come across or a technique that we

496
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:17,388
came across actually was this one in

497
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:20,928
this case the onion servers its own

498
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,669
private key every onion service has a

499
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:26,870
private key know the to operate and tour

500
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:29,839
and they had published it in the service

501
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:32,810
so once we found it we were able to take

502
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:36,470
over the service and gain control over

503
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:39,110
it we can replace the original service

504
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:42,799
this is something that can be easily

505
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:44,540
done and easily automate eyes then there

506
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,220
is another technique which is about

507
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:49,550
finding information in the mail that

508
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:54,649
data and pictures we can find many

509
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:58,010
metadata that refer to the owner or and

510
00:34:54,649 --> 00:35:00,319
sometimes a geolocation information so

511
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:03,890
we decided to do the same in the Tor

512
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,190
network so analyzing all these markets

513
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:13,670
and the million images that there are

514
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:16,280
inside of them 126 thousand we found 229

515
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:23,960
of them that contained information in

516
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:27,410
their metadata it's a small amount but

517
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,770
it is a first hand in order to help

518
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:35,089
people operating this kind of services

519
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:38,390
now going beyond the human error we can

520
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:43,550
look for faults in the information

521
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:45,950
systems used for these services here we

522
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:50,050
realize that they use the same things as

523
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:55,629
in the surface Drupal Joomla

524
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:59,410
WordPress PHP bb3 software to set up

525
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:03,100
shops such as world commerce or thank

526
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:05,049
God so this is software that is very

527
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:13,529
well known sometimes free software that

528
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:19,330
is community audited and there are also

529
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:22,270
information leaks we can see that

530
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:25,420
freedom hosting the largest server in

531
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:29,710
the dark web was attacked by Anonymous

532
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:32,830
and this way they found out that they

533
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:34,980
had more than ten thousand domains and

534
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:40,270
tor

535
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:43,510
so this hits tour very hard the main

536
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:45,550
subject of all those ten thousand

537
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:50,890
domains fifty percent of them more or

538
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:53,970
less were devoted to child sex abuse so

539
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:57,670
thanks to that more than eight hundred

540
00:36:53,970 --> 00:37:01,120
databases were published with user next

541
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:08,770
messages from our public and private for

542
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:13,750
emails and hashes from user passwords so

543
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:18,390
we analyzed all the information and what

544
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:23,650
was relevant was reported to our police

545
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:26,830
forces a few more operations that took

546
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:31,180
place throughout this year had to do

547
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:34,390
with our fab a hence closing this child

548
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:37,810
pornography forum in Germany so there is

549
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:39,640
a lot going on in tor so what are the

550
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:41,529
conclusions that we draw from these

551
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,520
analysis well

552
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:50,130
the hidden web isn't as dark as it looks

553
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,900
we realize that those behind it are

554
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:57,130
normal human beings they make mistakes

555
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:58,490
and we can be attentive trying to

556
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,450
disclose them

557
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:05,479
they use the same systems as in the

558
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:07,669
surface and the systems may have

559
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:10,119
vulnerabilities so our goal is to look

560
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:13,940
for them in order to disclose them and

561
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:17,510
then the last conclusion is that the

562
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:21,650
detection of cybercrime may sometimes be

563
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:26,300
automated and here is we where we take

564
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:30,610
apart so now what

565
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:33,710
after all these cases with all this

566
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:38,119
investigation how can we have our police

567
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:41,900
forces to arrest people behind these

568
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:45,530
services do we increase our resources

569
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:47,570
well we have great police forces in

570
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:53,030
Spain but they don't have endless

571
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:56,119
resources in order to investigate this

572
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:58,070
kind of thing 100 percent of the time so

573
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:01,250
what can we do automatize this is

574
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:03,500
something we are very good at and then

575
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:06,109
see them all of these techniques that

576
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:09,460
we've talked about on the deep web and

577
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:13,060
on the surface are potentially

578
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:16,790
automatize able since we develop

579
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:20,210
cybersecurity tools we decided to take

580
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,890
all the knowledge that we get from

581
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,680
police forces and that we get from our

582
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:29,950
own investigations and we turn them into

583
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:32,930
tools that make their work easier so

584
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:35,600
we've developed for example this tool

585
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:40,640
but you can see on the screen a tool

586
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:46,609
that crawls all the services and the toe

587
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:49,960
where in order to obtain relevant

588
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:54,740
information here there are some tags

589
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:59,330
this filter this well the screen was

590
00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:00,799
filtered out with the drug subject so

591
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:06,069
here we have them ordered and

592
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,070
categorized so that we can

593
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:15,480
act on these behaviors everything is

594
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:19,650
automatic all the phases sometimes are

595
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:22,530
in Syria we know how to build this

596
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:25,080
software mostly most of us are engineers

597
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:29,430
but at some point we don't have enough

598
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:33,150
knowledge in order to do it in this case

599
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:36,480
we hire specialized research teams that

600
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:40,830
analyze the texts and tor services the

601
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:44,550
images can be used in order to obtain

602
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:48,870
valuable information so these teams help

603
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:57,420
us categorize and prioritize that's why

604
00:40:48,870 --> 00:41:00,600
the investigation sort of services that

605
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:04,320
are running insightly dot onion inside

606
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:06,299
the hidden services and we show it in a

607
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,460
screen on a screen such as the one you

608
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,250
are now watching here we can see whether

609
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:14,430
it is it what service if it has SSH

610
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:16,770
ports if there is a file exchange

611
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,290
services of if there is an email service

612
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,960
behind a messaging service behind all

613
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:26,600
the information that we used to obtain

614
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:32,820
manually can be easily automate eyes and

615
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:36,750
prepared in tools for agents to use this

616
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:41,610
is the labeling part that I was telling

617
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:44,640
you about before here we have a almost

618
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:48,510
one category for each time of each type

619
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:53,160
of cybercrime with the algorithms we got

620
00:41:48,510 --> 00:42:00,060
from the research team managed to

621
00:41:53,160 --> 00:42:03,930
automate eyes them all areas of action

622
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:12,150
of the police forces can be categorized

623
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:15,210
as you watch on your labels we have if

624
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:18,270
we've been able to disclose the service

625
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:23,990
or not with the techniques that

626
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:29,640
we've mentioned we can label a service

627
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:32,250
if we are able to find out the IP or the

628
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:38,129
person was behind the service if it is

629
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:41,370
in Spain we also label it we label it

630
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:46,320
also if it's in Siebel related and if it

631
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:50,180
is vulnerable also we perform a light

632
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:54,030
search of the vulnerabilities that these

633
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:57,450
sites may have so vulnerable the

634
00:42:54,030 --> 00:43:00,660
detection and disclosure all these

635
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:04,649
techniques have been automatic to be

636
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:08,339
used in this tool for example obtaining

637
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:11,000
Internet domain this is what I was

638
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,520
referring to before we try to find

639
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,760
services that have one leg in the

640
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:26,130
superficial and and all the one in the

641
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:29,640
Tor web or net since we are crawling the

642
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:32,790
Tor net we try to obtain any additional

643
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:36,240
vulnerable information that might be

644
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:38,820
useful for example we have this piece of

645
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,609
news say in eleven people arrested in

646
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:44,490
Spain for distributing child pornography

647
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:50,820
through whatsapp so this happened

648
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:55,560
because we found a link in tor - what's

649
00:43:50,820 --> 00:44:00,980
up so we followed those links - what's

650
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:05,060
up it can be what's up or telegram and

651
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,430
here we can detect illegal activities

652
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:11,850
obtained all sorts of information

653
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:15,210
telephone numbers account numbers links

654
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:18,360
to Facebook or Twitter in case we can

655
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:21,690
relate to profiles with social media

656
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:24,960
profiles emails and all

657
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:27,359
the information that may enable us to

658
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,569
disclose the people behind tourist

659
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,119
services and not only the people who

660
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:36,270
have created them but the people who are

661
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,660
using them because this may be offenders

662
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:44,038
as well we try to obtain our Bitcoin

663
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:54,180
wallets github links this is also very

664
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:58,440
important because sometimes evil tools

665
00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:01,470
which are used in tor being more natural

666
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,530
that you find these tools and the links

667
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:12,680
to telegram and what's up what is the

668
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:19,589
goal the goal we are after is this to

669
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:22,578
manage to take down as many child

670
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:33,470
pornography services as possible or to

671
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:35,490
seize firearms or to perform operations

672
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:38,700
disclosing people behind money

673
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:41,160
laundering operations and things like

674
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,710
that this would be our goal and how do

675
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:47,339
we do that we take advantage of the

676
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:50,250
knowledge of our police forces who are

677
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:54,328
experts in analyzing this kind of crimes

678
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:58,099
we provide our capabilities we develop

679
00:45:54,329 --> 00:46:03,200
tools and automate eyes these operations

680
00:45:58,099 --> 00:46:07,109
with the aim of making a safer cyber

681
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,419
space and a safer world so thank you

682
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:11,770
very much and please if you have

683
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:18,510
questions do not hesitate to ask them

684
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:18,509
[Applause]

685
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:29,750
okay when it occurs which magician must

686
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:36,500
I guess I thank you so much guys there

687
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:38,599
is one question I have one doubt once

688
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,269
you know there is a servicing tour and

689
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:44,599
you've been able to evaluate it what

690
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:49,399
evidence do you need you know that you

691
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:54,859
prosecute somebody okay you disclose

692
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:57,500
that person if if you are able to get is

693
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:59,630
that enough to prosecute that person is

694
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:01,760
that enough to put them behind bars what

695
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:03,859
do you need more information no that's

696
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:09,260
not enough when we get that kind of

697
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:13,069
information that information goes to the

698
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:15,980
police services and its police forces

699
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:20,569
who launched the investigation and go

700
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:23,509
after the person is operating we don't

701
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:23,990
really violate those services inside at

702
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:27,259
all

703
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:30,019
what we do is report we report there is

704
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:33,470
this service and tour we've detected

705
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:34,700
that we use this software and we've

706
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:37,368
detected that they may have

707
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:40,640
vulnerabilities or exploits but we don't

708
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:44,089
tolerate or violate those services as we

709
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,910
aren't allowed to do it but we do report

710
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:51,740
police forces so that they take any

711
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:55,359
measures they consider effective but do

712
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:57,799
you need what kind of information or as

713
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,140
needed in order to put these people

714
00:47:57,799 --> 00:48:02,299
behind bars I know that this is

715
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:07,430
something that police forces have to do

716
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:10,369
not you well imagine we find and neck in

717
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:15,680
a child abuse forum and we are able to

718
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:17,570
link it to a Nick on Facebook or Twitter

719
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,759
if there is

720
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:24,250
strong evidence and a strong

721
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:27,710
relationship that they can dig in well

722
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,810
they cannot investigate the dark where

723
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:31,940
but they can go to Facebook or Twitter

724
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:34,370
no to find out more about that profile

725
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:38,570
and if they find that this could

726
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:41,240
potentially be the same person that can

727
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:44,990
be useful in order to arrest that person

728
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:47,390
we tried to give them all the valuable

729
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:51,049
information that we believe may be valid

730
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:52,759
to launch investigation I don't know if

731
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:56,650
I answered your questions yes thank you

732
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,650
very much I need further questions

733
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,190
thank you

734
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:16,070
you
