00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,090
when I started s a todos hello everybody

2
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,080
welcome and thank you for being here

3
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,790
after lunch on one on Friday the title

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,668
of this talk

5
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,500
threat intelligence what is that and how

6
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,370
what do I do it do you know anything

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:45,050
about this does it does this ring a bell

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,050
I suppose this interests you Who am I

9
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:53,159
fan of security like you I like to

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,970
innovate I like to be an intrapreneur or

11
00:00:53,159 --> 00:01:00,559
today I'm working in a big four it's a

12
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:04,229
consulting company to bringing

13
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:08,220
innovative solutions for threats I

14
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,689
worked in cyber intelligence I in cyber

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:16,350
camp 2015

16
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:19,978
we opened a startup and we were the

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,460
winners and so we we just love to

18
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:28,920
generate new ideas and I'm a fan also

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:31,979
about my wife and my daughter so you

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,399
will have kids you know that this is a

21
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,950
real passion and you can share passions

22
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:42,619
and you have to share your time do you

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:47,039
know what DLP traffic light protocol

24
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:49,380
it's a simple system very intuitive how

25
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:52,289
we share information what is really

26
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,539
interests us as what we can share with

27
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:57,420
whom we have documents in the

28
00:01:54,539 --> 00:02:03,569
intelligence area that will be attacked

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:06,420
as super confidential TLP red we can

30
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:13,410
share those within our organization and

31
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:16,850
the PIA amber for the community and the

32
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:21,810
TLP green and for the public at large

33
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:25,500
TLP white this is done in such a way

34
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,660
that if you're dealing with an incident

35
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,910
you don't want to expose confidential

36
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,010
information outside your team

37
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:35,579
so you have the definitions and where

38
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:39,540
this comes from this is applied and this

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:46,140
is protocol that is indicated in most of

40
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:49,470
slides well you will see those acronyms

41
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,489
in strategic points so this presentation

42
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:55,560
would be tagged as what it's none

43
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:58,770
unlimited dissemination for all publics

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,840
so it's TLP white this is being

45
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,060
implemented by the CR in the United

46
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,780
States for this presentation it will be

47
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,610
tagged as TLP was take this into account

48
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,130
for the introduction if you go to

49
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:16,320
security congresses and conferences or

50
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:20,280
you will see it in a very typical way

51
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,590
and people don't want to do you to make

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,150
take photos and this information

53
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,790
shouldn't be published in the internet

54
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:32,270
so depending on your color and if you're

55
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:38,130
interested this is a telegram grouper

56
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:43,170
dot me slash Jesus said you know that

57
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:46,470
these people are very busy or news

58
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:49,440
channels and the cyber cam 24/7 did you

59
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,859
have any doubts comments questions this

60
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,579
all this is welcome as for the structure

61
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,580
of my talk we'll see the finishes were

62
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,400
we're talking about intelligence types

63
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,350
of intelligence types of threats when we

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,850
speak about threats and intelligence

65
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,489
what is a threat would be agents its

66
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:14,750
actors and films the birds are called

67
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:17,760
actors you can imagine these people

68
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,640
carrying guns the maturity model within

69
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,280
the organization how we are ready or not

70
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,280
to defend ourselves and the next part

71
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,110
it's a collection use and sharing of

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,480
information what are our sources in what

73
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,790
formats because you have a lot of

74
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,610
information but you don't really know

75
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,950
how to move it from one place to another

76
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,639
and what are the platforms that I'll

77
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:48,969
help us

78
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:50,849
for that information sharings I'll give

79
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:54,389
you this presentation so you can

80
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:56,889
research on your part on your side and

81
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,199
I'll give you the names of my colleagues

82
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:05,229
so that you can make ask them questions

83
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:09,460
and then acknowledgments and thanks many

84
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:11,830
people have helped make this talk so I'd

85
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,810
like to thank him thank them and I hope

86
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:17,919
you will learn a lot you in this hour

87
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:22,629
and I'll give you the references so that

88
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:26,680
you can know more about this let's talk

89
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:32,830
about definitions I can FAC Tomas isto

90
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:37,569
why do we need this technology it's more

91
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:42,270
and more popular and instead of stealing

92
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:46,360
banks when instead of doing this with

93
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:49,960
guns and hammers it's easier from a bar

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,779
from home you can have malware

95
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,448
techniques and they they can make profit

96
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,779
and it's not about robbing banks it's

97
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:02,259
not just an economic or financial

98
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:04,990
purpose the technology allows for very

99
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:07,270
good things and this these people are

100
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:13,900
taking advantage threats continue to

101
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:16,419
adapt we stopped a security breach and

102
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:21,370
then that just afterwards there's a new

103
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:27,310
one so you can patch these every week

104
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:29,550
and this is detected very easily and the

105
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,550
traditional defense are less effective

106
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:36,159
people put a firewall and they think the

107
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:39,039
organization is protected when there's a

108
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:46,230
freising email through the secretary and

109
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:49,140
it's inside so so sometimes

110
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:52,650
this is very inefficient not just in

111
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:57,659
education but in technology in trainings

112
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:59,609
people have to be aware type of

113
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,060
intelligence

114
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:05,730
suppose that you know the O sinks open

115
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:09,030
source intelligence everything that you

116
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:13,530
can get from open sources fuming do you

117
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:17,429
know finish it's human intelligence

118
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:21,020
it's like spies movies people with

119
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:26,030
microphones or listening and talking

120
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:29,880
signal SIGINT signals economic

121
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:35,539
intelligence finished there are

122
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:38,190
companies which totalize bills by

123
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,290
Samsung and Apple to invest in the stock

124
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,950
exchange and they know that according to

125
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,880
the sales of the last quarter they know

126
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:48,180
how to make money

127
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,270
these are anonymous data but they having

128
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:58,040
a competitive edge because they know who

129
00:07:51,270 --> 00:08:01,710
earns more money geospatial intelligence

130
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,020
geo IND and sit-ins what is intelligence

131
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,450
there's a collection of data and what we

132
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,690
correlate data there's always data all

133
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,580
over the place the only thing to know is

134
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:16,500
how to process them and to explore them

135
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:19,520
once we have compiled a data when we

136
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,650
process data and we have information we

137
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,299
we don't have intelligence from data

138
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,840
which is have information when there's

139
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,360
an analysis of that information then we

140
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,309
can obtain what we could be called

141
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,880
intelligence that's what you see on the

142
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:37,949
right information is material with that

143
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,559
hasn't been assessed you can have a lot

144
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,570
of databases but if you can't really see

145
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:48,719
the meaning behind that you don't have

146
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:51,120
intelligence in my tokus speak about

147
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,540
threat intelligence it's the knowledge

148
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,090
of threats including capacities

149
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,880
infrastructure motivation goes and

150
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,209
what's behind the attacker you know that

151
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,939
we

152
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:07,579
hacktivists sometimes they just want to

153
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:09,809
have fun because they want to revenge

154
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:12,540
vindicate courses but then we have

155
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:16,259
armies are hackers behind a state and

156
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:19,849
they want to get information for a

157
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:24,240
financial goal you know the NSA tools

158
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:26,970
are tools used by the Chinese army how

159
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,670
can we protect ourselves we have sources

160
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,009
of information internal and external the

161
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,709
more information we have and the more

162
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:37,769
accurate this information is more

163
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:39,868
intelligence will be able to get you can

164
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:43,439
obtain this from honey pots

165
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:46,019
crowler's any type of source is valid to

166
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:49,529
obtain information to process it and to

167
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:52,559
obtain intelligence to do so there is an

168
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:54,329
intelligence cycle that allows you to

169
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,999
get information there's a comparative

170
00:09:54,329 --> 00:10:02,189
comparison between CIA and CNA in the

171
00:09:56,999 --> 00:10:06,420
CIA you have five States planning

172
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:08,248
direction the director says we are going

173
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:13,349
to obtain this type of information or

174
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:15,779
intelligence and the resources people to

175
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,799
start collecting in intelligence they

176
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:22,649
have people on on-site in signal

177
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:27,240
infiltrated people and resources are

178
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:28,699
quite wide we imagine all that they have

179
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,350
in the CIA

180
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:34,519
we are aware there are many sources of

181
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:39,619
information and they're more accessible

182
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:42,569
for governments after the processing

183
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:44,999
information in fact different teams were

184
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:48,029
separate teams should do that at the

185
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:51,839
same time in order to cross to do cross

186
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:54,779
information analysis and processing to

187
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,499
get out the necessary knowledge out out

188
00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:00,420
of that and then produce in intelligence

189
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:04,319
and dissemination once the cycle is

190
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:07,259
finished this is delivered to for

191
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,180
instance Chiefs of State of management

192
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:13,290
people if it's a company

193
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:18,130
as for the intelligence cycle applied to

194
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:22,810
tier I T this vague similar the C and I

195
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:26,170
in Spain uses military models all these

196
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:30,280
cycles come from the military arena and

197
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:34,390
we apply this for cyber war or at least

198
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,000
to detect threats then we obtain data

199
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,730
feeds information that gets to us from

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,070
Punic ports or campaigns of people who

201
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,460
are reporting malik malicious

202
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:48,220
information this information is external

203
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,690
its threat intelligence that more

204
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,170
valuable or less valuable information

205
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:56,680
depending if it's commercial or if we

206
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:59,800
generate this internally and if we have

207
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:04,270
on earth these breaches it's interesting

208
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:07,479
to see those to check that information

209
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:10,449
in order to analyze it once we analyze

210
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,820
the data what do we obtain valuable

211
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:16,570
information DT piece what Artie T piece

212
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:19,090
will speak about TT piece it's a

213
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,190
technical and procedures used by the

214
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,490
attackers how they are attacking their

215
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,140
neighbor once we know that maybe I can

216
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,180
protect myself from that that same

217
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,270
attack and procedure we can produce

218
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,109
threat models I want to know how do they

219
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,970
do it the the attack tree one of the

220
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,520
resources that you will find at the end

221
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:43,470
there's a presentation by David Barroso

222
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:51,340
where you will see the trees he prepares

223
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:52,780
trees and it's it they it attractive to

224
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,170
know that the threat so that the

225
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:58,089
attackers follow the route once we get

226
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,870
this information with refine

227
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:04,630
requirements we share or we deliver this

228
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,940
information with tic-tac c4 much I don't

229
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:11,500
know if you know them this format are

230
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:13,540
quite unified for information sharing an

231
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,910
exchange and then we are there is case

232
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,310
studies development once there is an

233
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,240
incidence we can follow up the case to

234
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,160
and then to close it and

235
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,380
lessons learned and in the next

236
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,680
iteration we will have more information

237
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,390
and more knowledge so it's good what are

238
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,329
the beneficiaries of this intelligence

239
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,390
well we have strategic tactical

240
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:38,460
operational and technical intelligence

241
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:42,840
the technical intelligence is the most

242
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:45,060
popular one so use your computer for

243
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,360
that but the CEO of the company or the

244
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:52,140
port are more interested in knowing what

245
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,120
are the external threats threats against

246
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:59,280
other companies or to the company itself

247
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:01,320
as this information from this

248
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,600
information you can generate

249
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,250
intelligence you need to adapt it to of

250
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,840
the stakeholder and to the the people

251
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:13,560
you are going to deliver it so you can

252
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,810
give reports on purchases on financial

253
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,119
decisions a company selling or buying

254
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,640
this can have an impact on the company

255
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,750
especially for the shareholders

256
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,660
observing in the internet or in other

257
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,090
sources you can deduct this top type or

258
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,670
deduce this type of information tactical

259
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:34,440
information tactics techniques and

260
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:36,900
procedures this information is about how

261
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,790
the actors want to attack us basically

262
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:42,079
oh it's about knowing their

263
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:46,800
sophistication level how they do it and

264
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:50,970
this information is for architects this

265
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,550
is operational information now the

266
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,320
security people and defense people use

267
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:59,280
this type of information and the

268
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,860
technical part is for the shock teams to

269
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,319
its technical teams and Incident

270
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:08,880
Response imagine that there's an attack

271
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,620
and there is a department managers

272
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,880
saying are we are being attacked let's

273
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:17,880
see how they do it and then we follow

274
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,590
the procedure they follow to attack to

275
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,980
report it you define the attack you see

276
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:28,410
the procedures that are being used and

277
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:32,339
once you've located them you know

278
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,579
already how you are being attacked and

279
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,620
you know how

280
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,180
remediated this information is given to

281
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:44,060
the operational team everything stops

282
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:46,339
and it's quite simple method how to lift

283
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,900
up the information and give it it to the

284
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,800
CEO of the company we've been attacked

285
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,079
we know how to stop it

286
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,540
and once we've we stopped it we you can

287
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:56,150
draft a report of what's happened what's

288
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,339
what about the incidents the financial

289
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:02,439
repercussions but thanks to a team and

290
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,440
to our work we've stopped the threat

291
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,229
what sort of information do we have

292
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:11,300
indicators ttp security alerts in from

293
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,700
automatic information and intelligence

294
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:18,589
repeaters I don't if you know but

295
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,130
intelligence reports have to be adapted

296
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:24,890
to the interlocutor but also technicians

297
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:27,380
read them so that they can deduce what's

298
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:34,040
happening and how to protect indicators

299
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:37,010
and o'seas are usually IP addresses or

300
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:41,449
atomic data that you can use to pinpoint

301
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:44,660
a hacking campaign if they're out of

302
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:48,130
context they may not have a much value

303
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:51,709
but if you raise them and you see how

304
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:53,720
Ram a software what sort of indicators

305
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,060
there are and with the hash you can get

306
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,150
more information and out to process it

307
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,000
what's interesting about that well that

308
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,129
the information that we have be

309
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,920
appropriate and that you can use it I'm

310
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:08,709
not going to talk much about this I'll

311
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,860
let you read it but as you know

312
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:14,750
everything that a company does what you

313
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:18,079
want is for it to be as quick as

314
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:20,030
possible so you can defend it as much as

315
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,889
possible what kind of threats are there

316
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:27,170
here you can see three threat landscape

317
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,970
there they main kinds of threats you've

318
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:36,680
got security breaches a service denial

319
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:39,080
exploits insiders that is people inside

320
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:44,540
the organization again sometimes do more

321
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:47,730
harm fishing which is one of the simple

322
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:52,658
most simple threats that attackers

323
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:58,539
but that are usually very successful if

324
00:17:52,659 --> 00:18:02,320
you go to the ETL page you can get more

325
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:05,249
information and you can see of each

326
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:10,299
threat its description and its type

327
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:12,129
there's also a mind map for threats it's

328
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,230
quite a big one you probably can't read

329
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:16,209
it from the back of the room but if you

330
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,759
look in more detail you see there's

331
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,320
malware that's probably what you've most

332
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:24,940
heard about in fact the next talks about

333
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,889
a malware adware information

334
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,080
manipulation attacks and other kinds of

335
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:32,229
attacks and they're not just computer

336
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,809
attacks there's also attacks if somebody

337
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:37,389
uses a device or that it's robbed or

338
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,830
somebody can recoup that information

339
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:43,600
that suddenly becomes a threat there are

340
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:47,379
also legal issues man-in-the-middle

341
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,629
issues and a whole list of threats that

342
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:51,459
probably you're not even considering

343
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,779
when you're trying to think about how to

344
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
protect an organization and they are

345
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:57,700
important

346
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,710
another issue that needs to be

347
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,279
considered because sometimes people

348
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:05,559
confuse threat with risk is to show

349
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:09,299
where the risk is under weather threats

350
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:17,019
line as you can see risk is equal to

351
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:18,460
threats multiplied by the

352
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:21,220
vulnerabilities and the impact they can

353
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,980
have so it's not just so much that you

354
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:28,059
are vulnerable to a threat but that the

355
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,070
attacker manages to use it and that it

356
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,369
does create a risk so all the factors

357
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,700
that we've seen do give you this risk

358
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:39,629
equation and that's important because if

359
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:43,029
you carry out a global survey that

360
00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:44,740
reflects the main concerns over the last

361
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:48,899
12 months of the largest companies in

362
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:52,210
the world you can see that malware risks

363
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:55,330
is one that the major companies are most

364
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:58,470
concerned with today or phishing attacks

365
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:03,139
these are the most harmful

366
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:05,400
in the last 12 months what CSO's of

367
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,470
Donna's bubbles the other security

368
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,659
managers what they've done they've

369
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:13,530
considered those are the most dangerous

370
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:16,169
as for vulnerabilities people who are

371
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,120
careless who don't pay attention I mean

372
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:20,820
the threats aren't necessarily in the

373
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,178
technology but actually sometimes it's

374
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,918
the employees or people that that try to

375
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,789
interrelate with technology you've

376
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,789
probably seen a gif

377
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:37,830
technology versus sysadmin and sometimes

378
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:39,840
it's the sysadmin that can get things

379
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,000
room it might not just be the secretary

380
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,158
that opens the fishing email might be

381
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,230
any kind of employee let's now look at

382
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:51,230
actors we're talking about the bad guys

383
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:55,640
motivation what sort of bad guys are out

384
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,890
there we've got opportunistic attacks

385
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:03,360
hobbyists people that just go home and

386
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:05,909
then I've got a few some spare time and

387
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,350
managed to get it into a database and

388
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:10,289
because they do it in their free time

389
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:12,809
but they are a threat for any kind of

390
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:15,408
organization sometimes you don't realize

391
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:20,100
that you're not safe and somebody can

392
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:22,500
create a lot of damage but there are

393
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:26,010
lower risks but if you go up the scale

394
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:30,200
there are activists activists people who

395
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:33,360
for political reasons come together to

396
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,840
carry out coordinated attacks on

397
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,570
security installations I'm sure you've

398
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,059
probably heard of cases in which people

399
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:46,039
come together as a group to achieve an

400
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:46,039
aim and the aim isn't always a fun

401
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:53,220
organized crime these are searching for

402
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,580
profit they want money either through

403
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,780
fraud extortion sometimes they use

404
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:03,000
personalized

405
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:04,920
malware Trojans ransomware but that's

406
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,700
usually through different organized

407
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:12,270
gangs in which each group takes charge

408
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,460
of each part and can create a lot of

409
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,980
harm and then there are advanced

410
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:22,050
persistent threats which are elite

411
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:25,770
groups who Rob intellectual property and

412
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:29,639
you can be dormant or and go undetected

413
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:32,850
for two years and who are spying making

414
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:36,179
money they've got their own malware

415
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:37,919
their own techniques and actually it's

416
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,300
kind of complicated to get hold of them

417
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,350
there are not very many of them but

418
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:45,620
they're usually very good at what they

419
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:47,820
do and state actors for example

420
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,159
governments like the Chinese government

421
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,870
I'm trying to point the finger at

422
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:59,540
anybody but we know that China has a

423
00:22:51,870 --> 00:23:04,080
hacker army and these attack countries

424
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:05,909
try to influence in elections these are

425
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,790
people with lots of resources and

426
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:13,100
they've got a state financing funding

427
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:16,620
these kind of things diplomatic problem

428
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:22,980
they are very very highly advanced and

429
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:24,750
it's kind of complicated to defeat them

430
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,990
because they can manipulate them how do

431
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:33,270
they go about this normally the kill

432
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:36,330
chain is is how the attack happens

433
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:39,080
there's a recognition phase the

434
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,850
techniques to recognize the the victim

435
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:45,960
and you can see what infrastructures

436
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:49,409
they have it exposed possible vulnerable

437
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,900
vulnerabilities what attack lines then

438
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,980
you can manufacture malware

439
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,210
made-to-measure

440
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,790
this is the initial stage which you know

441
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:02,520
that you're going to follow and you

442
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:06,409
concentrate on a directly defied then

443
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,410
the delivery sometimes you know

444
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:23,429
fishing or spearfishing the lottery

445
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:26,789
Christmas and you send the email but

446
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:29,549
fishing and spearfishing campaigns are

447
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:31,559
smaller and far more directed once the

448
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:35,970
employee or the person who's being

449
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:39,570
attacked opens their email you'll get

450
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:45,539
their starting running once the malware

451
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:50,759
or the attach is opened and there are

452
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:55,940
several techniques the program is

453
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,940
installed and a back door is left open

454
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:08,629
to carry on accessing in the future what

455
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:11,840
sort of options are out there there's

456
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:14,699
information theft information

457
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,480
manipulation it's important to know what

458
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,429
the aim is the target is and then carry

459
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,070
it out there are a thousand different

460
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:28,080
ways of hiding what you're doing and to

461
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,460
glean the data that are interesting for

462
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,369
the attacker at that time how do we

463
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:38,999
detect these kind of attacks we can

464
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:41,908
detect through the malware sample we can

465
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:43,739
remove the hash and with that we could

466
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:47,970
see whether other endpoints have been

467
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:51,080
affected by this sample and or by the

468
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:55,080
same attack IP addresses if we detect

469
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:59,480
that an attacks been launched from an IP

470
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,480
address we can block it in our firewall

471
00:26:01,549 --> 00:26:07,649
however if they've already in got into

472
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,570
several pieces of equipment they've just

473
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:13,109
got to change their IP address domain

474
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:15,029
names because if we could discover the

475
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:16,699
domain names that they use for the

476
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:19,159
control

477
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:22,549
- DeLong downloads more information we

478
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:26,330
can block them but attackers can find

479
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:32,090
others and it's quite easy to register a

480
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:35,570
domain net artifacts and TTP's when we

481
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:38,779
finally hit the nail on the head the

482
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:41,450
procedural techniques are the most

483
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:44,269
complicated things to detect for an

484
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:46,609
analyst but that what most harms that

485
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,710
the attacker once you've discovered how

486
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:51,830
the attack has been carried out it's

487
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:55,460
actually fairly easy to detect the next

488
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:58,789
iteration so the attacker will create a

489
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,529
domain and IP address is fairly easy but

490
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:02,269
are changing their techniques completely

491
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:05,029
from top to bottom is far more difficult

492
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:09,519
- that takes more time there's something

493
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:09,519
else which comes from counter craft

494
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:15,940
which is counterintelligence

495
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:20,149
counterespionage that's hack

496
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:24,590
intelligence where the attacker may feel

497
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:27,908
that they've they've attacked the target

498
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:38,480
and can extract information from it

499
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:40,369
that's counter intelligence so you adapt

500
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,139
to what he's doing and you allow them to

501
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:49,309
do what they're doing

502
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:54,758
examples of TTP's military server which

503
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:57,859
has been infected communication channels

504
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,629
normally in universities they add to

505
00:27:57,859 --> 00:28:03,999
whitelist and nobody suspects that in

506
00:27:59,629 --> 00:28:03,998
university because they may have a a

507
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:08,509
piece of equipment a computer that's

508
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:12,190
affected and they don't know that or

509
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:14,899
there's also backdoors as well it's

510
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:18,259
these the sort of TTP's that are used if

511
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:21,179
we detect all the procedures that the

512
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:25,350
attackers have then of course we can

513
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:33,490
deal with them this is a threat report

514
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:40,780
you can see the time frame I work the

515
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:45,430
identifier malware's name campaigns that

516
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:48,490
are known at that time the reports they

517
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:50,140
were that was not no TTP's and the first

518
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:55,120
thing you they write is that a curse of

519
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:57,990
spearfishing and another one comes in

520
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,669
additional information or indicators

521
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:05,380
with hashes and they're there different

522
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:08,320
letters are up on the screen and you can

523
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,580
follow the malware and see what it says

524
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,580
about that there are other platforms

525
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:15,850
that also I'll show you to obtain more

526
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,500
information one of these reports can

527
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,820
tell you whether you could be affected

528
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,470
or not or whether you need to look at it

529
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,740
in more detail and the references as

530
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:29,290
well this is a more technical report and

531
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:33,460
what we're seeing here are strategic

532
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:36,180
kind of reports when you get agent

533
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,700
trends how they're moving

534
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:41,680
it's a quarterly or four months of new

535
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:46,900
reports you don't get so much technical

536
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:48,550
information so much so many technical

537
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,380
details but you do see the kind of

538
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:55,120
groups that are being attacked here you

539
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:58,260
can see one of the groups a p229 I think

540
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:02,260
it's called has different names

541
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:04,030
interesting names and they're several

542
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,950
references to the same groups with

543
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:12,190
different names if you want have a look

544
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:18,100
at this there are pictures such as apt

545
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:19,750
threating names of these groups what

546
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,280
they're called lingers to get more

547
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:25,360
information about them and campaigns

548
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,660
that you know you won't get all the

549
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,120
information from public sources but if

550
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,040
there are groups of people that are

551
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,830
trying to bring all this information

552
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,720
together in one

553
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:42,860
site another page in google if you

554
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,730
search ATP 29 a BT 29 here you can find

555
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:51,139
groups operations malware and

556
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:52,580
investigate what these people some kind

557
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,289
of people are like because they're TTP's

558
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,500
go inside or cuz the hash that's popped

559
00:30:54,289 --> 00:31:00,408
up is the same as one from another

560
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:06,309
campaign let's now move on to the

561
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:10,490
maturity models what you do is collect

562
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:11,809
information when the organisation is

563
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:15,049
trying to implement a strategic

564
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:18,110
intelligence plan there you can see the

565
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:22,158
different platforms where you can gain

566
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:24,320
data what many people do is try to get

567
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,100
information what's interesting is to

568
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,230
analyze data gradually make the program

569
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,678
more mature get information about

570
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,840
business decisions and on that basis you

571
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:43,100
can see whether they're attacking you or

572
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:45,709
a neighbor what you can prevent certain

573
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:48,799
kinds of attacks refine processes and

574
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:50,539
take active defense this is when there's

575
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:56,299
a very mature organization has its own

576
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:58,360
team for defense and can generate

577
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:01,370
intelligence internally not all

578
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,939
organizations have that possibility cuz

579
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,590
it's expensive and sometimes it's not

580
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,720
even accessible because you can spend

581
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:13,699
years looking into a campaign you always

582
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:18,620
see all the others may be affecting you

583
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:21,710
here you've got a maturity model which

584
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:24,649
is more detailed on the left in that

585
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:27,860
column you can see the basic state and

586
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:29,809
on the right what you access and at the

587
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,580
bottom you can see the complete

588
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:34,970
reference you can see whether you're

589
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:38,779
working in a company what stated seeing

590
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,990
where you can improve the next and this

591
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:42,330
is

592
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,100
I've divided into the technical side of

593
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,080
things strategic and operational and the

594
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,730
technical side of things it's written in

595
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,860
English and that's very important for

596
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:54,510
this sector of cyber security and threat

597
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,850
intelligence it's very important that's

598
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,350
written in English the majority of the

599
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:00,750
documents that we're talking about are

600
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:04,230
written in English here we can review

601
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:06,900
indicators and where you see indicator

602
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,900
analysis the first box says that if we

603
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:16,970
got them in Excel and they're stored

604
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:19,170
manually we need to look at the next

605
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:23,280
area see where they indicated as a

606
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:25,110
shared extracted and directly go to a

607
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:30,000
system which can either share them or

608
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:31,770
extract to them or the indicator

609
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,940
application if we've detected in a

610
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:38,250
sample that might be malicious we can go

611
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,070
from computer to computer to see what's

612
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,890
happened or automate it with a third

613
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:45,810
party software to avoid the manual

614
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:50,600
dealing with things these are subjects

615
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:53,040
things that you learn over time and once

616
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,020
you suffered from different attacks

617
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:59,909
experience shows you that you need to

618
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:04,020
mature as for organizations this was

619
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:06,840
taken from a security survey where you

620
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:11,670
can see that there are organizations

621
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,960
that don't have a program for threat a

622
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:19,170
program of threat intelligence or

623
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:20,550
companies that share information I've

624
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:23,430
got an intelligence of threat

625
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:31,740
intelligence program are able to look at

626
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:36,299
external feeds 12% of companies have

627
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:43,290
intelligence teams and only 6% have an

628
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:47,240
advanced function which are dedicated

629
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:50,629
intelligence and create intelligence

630
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:55,129
and this is to make it reliable these

631
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:57,890
are of course studies in which several

632
00:34:55,129 --> 00:35:01,339
companies participate and you can see

633
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:07,129
the size not much done or what has been

634
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:11,240
done isn't very advanced collection

635
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:14,030
using and sharing information and this

636
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,270
part we're going to look at sources

637
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:22,550
formats and platforms as for sources you

638
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:25,580
know in surface web you can find indexed

639
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:30,140
and or sentient acts open access and

640
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:32,650
free feeds and some kind of tools that

641
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:37,000
you can start with in the Deep Web

642
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:40,310
these aren't indexed by search engines

643
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,970
sometimes it's information that isn't

644
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:49,130
accessible to everybody and as for the

645
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:52,580
deeper sometimes the information is only

646
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:55,790
accessible if you're invited in certain

647
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,619
closed communities where content can

648
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,390
last for a few minutes or a few hours

649
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:04,400
it's not always possible to access it

650
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:06,379
what about sources if we got an anti

651
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,780
phishing source here you can see the

652
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,840
type of format you can access their

653
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:15,910
website and obtain information what are

654
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:19,490
you interested in we're not seeing it

655
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:23,690
manually but able to access it through a

656
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:25,490
P ie each platform each source may have

657
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,350
a different format but what we're

658
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:30,169
interested in the future is to

659
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:38,210
standardize or use a common format in

660
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:40,640
which our platform communicates find the

661
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:44,650
information or request it sometimes it's

662
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,650
not always easy to find that information

663
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:55,350
notify that and score to indicates

664
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:59,310
whether the information

665
00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:00,990
is correct or not and you can see

666
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,570
whether it's an automatic bot let's take

667
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:13,100
the case obviously you get to lowest

668
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:15,780
score there so it's not to confuse and

669
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:26,790
see the trusting of information there

670
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:28,530
are the oh you've got other indicators

671
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,779
to detect them or to apply them in your

672
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:33,540
system there are commercial sources as

673
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,000
well such as this one where you get

674
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:39,180
information about IPs malicious IP spots

675
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,680
that do logins activist campaigns and

676
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:47,970
others as well what are we interested in

677
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:50,669
here it can be integrated in it seeing

678
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:53,520
and how this information can be used to

679
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:57,150
correlate with internal indicators to

680
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,790
see whether there are any IPS connected

681
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:02,130
to malicious attack on with these type

682
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:04,410
of commercial feeds we can get it if we

683
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,570
don't use blank but another kind of

684
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,420
platform there's another format for

685
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:13,190
information where we can adapt to our

686
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,620
needs or consults them directly and

687
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:19,110
integrate it with the happy that's inner

688
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,190
solution but we don't have to reinvent

689
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,350
the wheel

690
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,910
there are a lot server platforms such as

691
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,970
Yeti which we'll look at in a moment

692
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:30,600
that will give you sources integration

693
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:32,850
these are the open sources I try to make

694
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,310
a list of them so that you could tinker

695
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:37,620
with them there are many commercial

696
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:41,700
tools that I'm not mentioning but if

697
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:50,839
you're interested we can mention them at

698
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:53,460
the end Simon i/o here you can see

699
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,080
different repositories with information

700
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,600
sources which is very useful and

701
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,819
interesting where there's a high level

702
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,250
of trust in that information so there

703
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,720
are many investigators putting

704
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,220
information in there and what's good as

705
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,049
you can also share it you've got the URL

706
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,509
if you're interested in

707
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:15,360
at formulas here you can see there are

708
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:18,300
different formats SIF open IO sees few

709
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:21,480
box stick stacks let's have a sudden

710
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:30,119
make a summary of what dicks and tacks

711
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:31,770
are depending upon what platform you use

712
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,390
one or the other whichever you find most

713
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:36,150
convenient the best thing is to get to

714
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,589
know them and try to exchange

715
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,880
information between several of them

716
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,470
because you've probably got different

717
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,980
kinds of information you're probably

718
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:45,569
interested in this threat intelligence

719
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,070
information you probably want it to be

720
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:54,350
able to share to share it easier with

721
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:57,510
sticks information is shared by machines

722
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,799
consistently and legibly it's important

723
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,690
that we be able to read it but that also

724
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,030
that machines be able to read it and

725
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:07,160
that it be reliable there's more

726
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:10,530
information about that in the github

727
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,310
page how what does it look like well

728
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:15,780
there's a part

729
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:19,009
- that's TT piece as I said before which

730
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:23,310
are tactics techniques and procedures

731
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:25,440
there's detractors response to the

732
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:29,700
attack this always information can be

733
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:36,359
represented by cons group identities and

734
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:40,790
boy indicator identities the IOC which

735
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:45,900
is indicators hashes and eyepiece

736
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:49,170
intrusion sets which are malware kits or

737
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:52,950
whatever is being made to attack it's

738
00:40:49,170 --> 00:41:02,310
like the set of intrusions that's used

739
00:40:52,950 --> 00:41:06,740
to attack the corporation malware which

740
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:06,740
is past the most atomic kind of date

741
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,990
reports which we looked at briefly

742
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,160
what's what each report means positive

743
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,160
information is out there

744
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:23,578
they're real bad guys and you know they

745
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:27,720
are depicted with a guy with a hat and

746
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:31,470
glasses legitimate software sometimes to

747
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:35,549
achieve its objective malicious

748
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:39,828
attackers use tools legitimate

749
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:42,210
commercial tools for their campaigns and

750
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:44,869
vulnerabilities which software mistakes

751
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:48,390
many of you will have found lots of them

752
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:52,980
some zero-day type if they're not

753
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:55,710
reported to the company who owns the

754
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,220
software sometimes they used in the

755
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:08,010
shade to attack certain companies and

756
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:09,328
obtain a profit percentage to relate to

757
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,550
this information and see that

758
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:15,390
something's been observed here you can

759
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:21,240
see how what sort of activity with

760
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:23,129
seeing you can see this yes you can want

761
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,770
to tell what threats we're seeing what

762
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:32,369
indicators that affair what tactics are

763
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:34,530
being used to support exploits if you're

764
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:37,980
used to attack us what actors are behind

765
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:41,130
that and how we can solve it because on

766
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:47,250
many occasions having seen everybody

767
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:49,260
else's list we're interested in how to

768
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:55,079
solve the problem not just a dictate it

769
00:42:49,260 --> 00:43:02,280
but also how to solve it information

770
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:06,119
exchange platforms this is a P which

771
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:08,520
aligns the exchange models taxi it's

772
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,640
been designed especially to interact

773
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,240
with s tix so you've got collections

774
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:19,190
which are repositories of objects

775
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:22,970
requests are made in request reply mode

776
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:27,589
the canals show you the producers

777
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,589
sending data to one or several

778
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:34,310
consumers you can't rely on all of them

779
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:38,000
you can enjoy your own conclusions let's

780
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:38,930
now move on to the platform okay you can

781
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,990
see there's all sorts of information

782
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:45,790
both internal and external as for

783
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:49,390
internal there's parts that are reliable

784
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:54,190
forensic investigation teams the

785
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:57,520
forensic side and machine analysis is

786
00:43:54,190 --> 00:44:01,520
related to threat intelligence

787
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,970
penetration team and that's together

788
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,840
with external part of things such as

789
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:11,810
different external thoughts crawlers

790
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:16,880
malware lists and their database is full

791
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:19,279
of vulnerabilities this is all combined

792
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,260
and you get to the threat intelligence

793
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,100
which you can take action on let's just

794
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:28,610
briefly look at the threat intelligence

795
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:30,620
platforms the application program that

796
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:35,960
allows me to centralize those data and

797
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:37,940
to reach conclusions many of those that

798
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,070
allow you to take information and out of

799
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:42,260
malware you can take samples but can be

800
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:44,390
the first of the class and maybe you're

801
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,310
taking you're seeing a malware that

802
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:49,790
nobody has seen so this information may

803
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:53,779
be very valuable and then we have a free

804
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:57,380
use tools or commercial tool so some of

805
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:59,420
them have a trial period and limited

806
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:02,900
functionality but it's useful because

807
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,320
you can just have an idea of how to use

808
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:08,270
them

809
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:15,710
let's see intel mq incident handling

810
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:19,730
platform these tools are good for set to

811
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:22,760
work with Incident Response Teams this

812
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:28,670
allows you to collect a great number of

813
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:31,430
data and as you can see here there's a

814
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:32,070
part of important export of data here

815
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,190
you

816
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:38,850
and link it see the data flow and how to

817
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:42,480
work with this I want to import data

818
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:50,299
browser to export them with me Sierra

819
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:54,920
rules etc this is the exports part with

820
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:59,850
API this is the formats that you can

821
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:03,630
pick in some he will see the information

822
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:05,060
that is contained you'll see it in JSON

823
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,920
format

824
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:10,049
you will see what our field information

825
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:16,230
contained and how this information is

826
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:20,430
brought to the next entity exit you see

827
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:21,060
the type of exit that all these data can

828
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:24,470
give you

829
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:27,090
where does information come from boats

830
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:30,839
so boats are collecting information and

831
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:34,440
this is updated regularly most of this

832
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:37,110
data this is public information so you

833
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,810
can subscribe to those and start seeing

834
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:42,240
information later on we'll see how to

835
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:47,370
treat it how to process it and interact

836
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:51,509
it you can use qivana so that this can

837
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:54,000
be operational this is cabana free

838
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:59,430
software you can install this for free

839
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:02,370
keep cabana elastics lock start last

840
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:05,310
o'clock starts and I just can't remember

841
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:10,650
the other one and well Cabana you can

842
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:15,390
view all the data searches here through

843
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:20,040
malware mile code you can search for the

844
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:23,250
source of information or IPS or types of

845
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:26,880
attacks this is a type of information

846
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:30,330
that we can obtain in this type of

847
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:34,380
platforms as you can see it's quite free

848
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:37,380
and open to what you want to do it not

849
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:40,410
everything is written you can enlarge it

850
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:42,670
with your own modules and take more

851
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:46,629
advantage of this tool

852
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:50,320
as for Mizpah tools this is used by

853
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:53,260
third in CB is using that too

854
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,940
this is used to share information for

855
00:47:53,260 --> 00:48:00,090
malware indicators

856
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:04,210
this is tagged well you see the big

857
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:06,160
letters at BP wipe what is the type of

858
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,020
information I can share and with whom

859
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,000
sometimes we share information between

860
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:13,000
companies or between the national certs

861
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,550
or between all bodies that are validated

862
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,280
with you can subscribe you see that the

863
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:24,040
European cert is working with this

864
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:26,980
platform Yeti is another tool that you

865
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:30,390
can use it's quite intuitive and quite

866
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:36,060
recent here you can see the campaign

867
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:36,060
follow follow up actors malware

868
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:43,479
everything is centralized a single

869
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,760
location but if you go to look for

870
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,500
information in many places it's not very

871
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:52,090
effective it's better to have in a

872
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:54,850
single location it's good to have an AP

873
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:59,850
/ - no if this IP is malicious or not or

874
00:48:54,850 --> 00:49:03,730
if it belongs to an well-known actor so

875
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:06,279
it's our trial to analyze that in a

876
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:09,490
single location and if you can do the

877
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,550
enriching of investigations with graphic

878
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:16,839
format much the better here with this

879
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:19,270
picture we can see it easier for humans

880
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:22,930
it's much easier to understand in a

881
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:28,780
graphic way let's see the Simon io

882
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:31,509
platform these platforms you can search

883
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:39,430
directly what do you look for in the

884
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:48,490
search engine for threats here let's

885
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:51,259
look for one of these samples kira

886
00:49:48,490 --> 00:50:00,750
malware malware

887
00:49:51,260 --> 00:50:02,760
of course the hash searching this case

888
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:07,590
and out of this document I want to get

889
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:11,520
more additional information about RAM

890
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:13,920
somewhere here with a web web interface

891
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:21,540
well you can use consoles here the list

892
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:24,210
of reference tools you can see the hash

893
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:28,110
that is related to other hashes with

894
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:30,660
with with which virus if we do the

895
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:34,800
search in other communities like blue

896
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:38,779
lift blue live here you can search

897
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:42,360
indicators you can share information I'm

898
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:47,940
searching for total virus this is alien

899
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:50,360
boat so typing the same hash I can get

900
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,360
more information

901
00:50:51,660 --> 00:51:01,379
you see another community Tia runs

902
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:01,650
somewhere Padilla Remsen where petia IOC

903
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,210
s

904
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:04,890
and then you can have compromised

905
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:07,110
indicators this is a virus total

906
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:13,799
intelligence the same hash and the

907
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:15,450
information that I can obtain here I get

908
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,090
more information about the file itself

909
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:21,000
the executive all the antivirus that

910
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:24,900
detect this so having the hashes and

911
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,060
they did in the indicators you will find

912
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:30,020
what antivirus can detect this this is

913
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:32,880
two years ago you can see the details

914
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:37,620
content of the file analysis who detects

915
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:45,540
it who doesn't detect it and comments of

916
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:47,790
the files and actions I'm sorry because

917
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:55,470
I didn't show you this this is the

918
00:51:47,790 --> 00:52:00,920
actors chart these apt groups operations

919
00:51:55,470 --> 00:52:03,480
and malware search engines actor trucker

920
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,920
and I think that's all

921
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:15,010
and that's what I showed you at the

922
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:16,650
beginning references in my presentation

923
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:19,480
shows that you can have a look and

924
00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:22,420
obtain information from specific samples

925
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,580
and if you think that web is malicious

926
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:27,670
you can have a look at it commercial

927
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:32,410
tools you can make a test do a test of

928
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:34,960
the AVM tool of course it's very good

929
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:39,129
repository x-force for threat

930
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:42,580
intelligence eco compatible how do we

931
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:45,040
share information about threats we see

932
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:48,390
it Sox you know it's a security

933
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:52,300
operational center that's sock their

934
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:54,450
information is shared with other Sox but

935
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:59,560
some of them don't share any information

936
00:52:54,450 --> 00:53:01,689
these global surveys it's not easy to

937
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:05,680
share information it's not always

938
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:09,130
accessible because personal data could

939
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:14,350
be violated in Spain ip's are considered

940
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:17,230
as personal data I'd like to thank some

941
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:23,770
people even Gonzalo these guys always

942
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:26,400
helped me in all projects we are always

943
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:30,550
together doing something these

944
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:33,630
colleagues in cybersecurity as a recap I

945
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:38,200
hope that you've learnt about formats

946
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:41,590
stick taxi threat intelligence strategic

947
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:43,680
and operational tactics the tools that

948
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:46,300
you could start using many of them are

949
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:49,029
in web format if you're not very good in

950
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:52,090
consoles so others can be installed very

951
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:54,490
easily in your computer and if you

952
00:53:52,090 --> 00:54:00,090
prefer to program you can interact with

953
00:53:54,490 --> 00:54:07,899
a api's to MMM manage information

954
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:11,530
references many links here here you will

955
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:15,510
find enough information to go ahead if

956
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:17,230
you're interested and at some points

957
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:20,800
explanations are very good

958
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:25,690
but you can also contribute I don't know

959
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:28,900
if you have doubt to questions we left a

960
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:32,790
channel telegram channel and a telegram

961
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:36,250
group so that we can be updated on this

962
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:39,279
section you can ask through telegram or

963
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:52,960
if you want to ask questions here I will

964
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:53,530
be glad to do so thank you very much

965
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,540
indeed

966
00:54:53,530 --> 00:55:02,679
thank you for your attention

967
00:54:54,540 --> 00:55:02,679
[Applause]

968
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,670
you
