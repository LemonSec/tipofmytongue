important event on a national level in

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,720

here to speak about social networks and

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,440
about the evolution of the Guardia Civil

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:10,350
the civil guard in this respect and I'd

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:13,920
like to say that our corpse since 1884

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,158
were told that we would be a protection

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,620
for victims and for those who were

18
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:26,310
suffering and that we would take care of

19
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:30,090
the needs of everybody in petha MO and

20
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:35,070
this is what we've been doing since 1884

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:42,060
a 44 driver and we've been evolving and

22
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:44,969
adapting to new technologies the types

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,659
of crimes and we have different we've

24
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:54,839
been working in different areas and

25
00:01:47,659 --> 00:02:00,119
domains land air etc see right now we're

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,999
also in cyberspace and in 1996 so we

27
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,659
first detected the need to do research

28
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:08,310
in the field of new technologies and

29
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:11,280
we've been evolving and the group has

30
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,020
been adapted has been adapting as I was

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,990
saying to these new technologies and

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,730
right now we've become a department were

33
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:22,380
no longer group the Department for

34
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,280
telematic crimes and very recently we

35
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,850
held

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,030
our 20th anniversary and this these are

37
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:34,489
pictures from another conference on

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:39,450
Security and a Madrid and we were

39
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:43,830
invited to participate we were invited

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,220
to speak about the history of the

41
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:50,010
apartment and here we have three

42
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,260
different directors of the unit one of

43
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,410
them couldn't attend because they have

44
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,590
been four and I'd like to say the

45
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:04,079
president the group is structured in the

46
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:07,080
following way on the lieutenant there's

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,540
a section also for institutional

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,870
relations and citizens collaboration

49
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,790
that I belong to you and also an

50
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,630
Operations Department that's in charge

51
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,269
of investigation per se and is made up

52
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,060
by four sections one of them has to do

53
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:27,769
with crime against people another one on

54
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:35,459
hacking security and also fraud and

55
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:37,440
economic crime and copyrights etc and

56
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,709
then we have another department that

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,140
takes care of developing systems and

58
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,440
applications that will help us in with

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,529
our research and also technical support

60
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:54,810
and support regarding the analysis of

61
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:57,180
the evidence that we get obviously we

62
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,810
collaborate on a national level with the

63
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:05,730
rest of our colleagues of other police

64
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:11,480
from other police forces University the

65
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:16,950
Attorney General Department the hacker

66
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:19,870
community and by hackers we mean people

67
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,880
who are interested in security and

68
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:29,770
Vail's and works for security we don't

69
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,990
use this to mean criminals no way

70
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,500
and we also collaborate with a private

71
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,360
sector and we also hold an international

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,960
collaboration through our bilateral

73
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:46,630
relations with other police forces

74
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:48,609
Europol Interpol and networks 24/7 and

75
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:55,080
other institutions such as the ones we

76
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:55,080
can see that fight child pornography and

77
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:05,260
abuse child abuse etc and here we have

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,870
colleagues from FBI Europe oh well and

79
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,889
this is a an example of international

80
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:16,449
collaboration right now Internet has no

81
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:20,830
borders and our mission is the work on

82
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:23,710
all the information we may get and that

83
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,770
could lead to a police investigation

84
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:30,520
well whenever judges tell us to

85
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:34,090
investigate something or whenever the

86
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,310
Attorney General asked us to do so we

87
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:40,000
work in different sorts of operations

88
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:47,580
for instance this international

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:53,740
operation for instance children

90
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:56,590
pornography dealing traffic and others

91
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:02,380
operations such as the opie riccati a

92
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:04,349
recent thing by which a group of

93
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:11,849
criminals were

94
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:15,589
arrested they had gained made 330

95
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:21,719
million euros through a malware and

96
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:23,909
through different cyber crimes and so

97
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:29,669
these are different operations like for

98
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:35,248
instance against intellectual property

99
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:40,139
and copes force has been evolving

100
00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:46,409
because at the beginning Prime in the in

101
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:47,999
the net used to was 1.0 users went in

102
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:50,959
the Internet in order to get information

103
00:06:47,999 --> 00:07:00,360
or in order to look at certain things

104
00:06:50,959 --> 00:07:02,999
also so now we work on crime such as

105
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,669
corruption and children prostitution

106
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:13,759
that was the past and then we moved on

107
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:13,758
to to door all cyber crime and cyber

108
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:22,110
cyber crime things more related to

109
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,099
technology and now we move to three

110
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:31,229
point of and we are in the antechamber

111
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:35,459
of 4.0 were already speaking about cyber

112
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:38,758
attacks cyber spying cyber war we're

113
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:41,849
already speaking about a war and the net

114
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:44,669
and some people say that were already

115
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:48,740
into cyber war our department's been

116
00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:53,159
evolving so in 2005 and this one point

117
00:07:48,740 --> 00:08:01,080
web we launched our first web this is a

118
00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:04,619
weapon that was used to do queries we

119
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,409
used to use an email something that is

120
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:09,389
the used little by little we've been

121
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:12,099
making progress and this is a picture

122
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,900
from the web we have right now

123
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,830
and right from the beginning we're

124
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:20,140
publishing alerts news and or any

125
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,510
information that we thought would be

126
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:28,330
interesting for internodes

127
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:32,289
in this 2.0 think we have an interaction

128
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:35,650
of the user with us and I have to say

129
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,870
that telematic complaints I did not

130
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:43,780
exist but through our portal you can

131
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:49,480
download forums and once you've filled

132
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:52,240
them in and you can you can submit them

133
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,950
in order to be able to report on

134
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,940
whatever has happened to you and to this

135
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:04,330
and we use this service called the II

136
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:09,760
guarantee or you guarantee and it's an

137
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:13,360
online witness to speak of so this can

138
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,930
this tells us what was present in the

139
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:21,190
web at the time of the capture and we

140
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:24,000
can also use it as legal as legal

141
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:28,240
evidence then we have what we call

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,600
collaborate it's this collaborative part

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:36,030
by citizens through this I want to

144
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,920
report on and they can report on any

145
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,339
suspicious attitude or something they

146
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,829
may see in the web I was talking to

147
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,690
somebody and we're saying we don't need

148
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,660
to know whether this is a crime or not

149
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:52,870
it's something which as we see it could

150
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:55,530
perhaps be a crime so through this

151
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:59,080
portal we can find out

152
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:02,800
anonymously you can send there's a file

153
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,530
telling us what you are so who the

154
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,949
suspect could be so little by little

155
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:10,589
were sent information in this case we

156
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,639
are sent

157
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:18,719
Twitter profiles which in this case went

158
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:21,749
against children pornography so we work

159
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:26,069
on this information we analyze it if

160
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:28,739
it's information we can access to we

161
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:31,228
start with an investigation or if it's

162
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:37,079
an investigation that is related to

163
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:40,109
somebody abroad outside of Spain so this

164
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:42,659
is information that we submit or sent to

165
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:45,719
other colleagues in other countries and

166
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:51,149
then we started with social networks

167
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:54,419
where the 3.0 thing so since 2010 we

168
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:58,319
started having our first profiles in

169
00:10:54,419 --> 00:11:02,669
Twitter Facebook and 2020s called a

170
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:07,679
social network aimed at teenagers mainly

171
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:11,098
20 as you very well know well 20

172
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:13,319
disappeared and we added YouTube by

173
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:16,919
adding contents that I will tell you

174
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:19,498
about in a few minutes so what do we do

175
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:23,098
with the profiles we have in social

176
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:33,989
networks in Twitter and Facebook we try

177
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:37,499
to we try to somehow we focus on

178
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:42,569
campaigns launched by Europe or or

179
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:44,849
campaigns that deal with profile by the

180
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:47,878
way this is a person who's a disappeared

181
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:53,269
so we disseminate this or we disseminate

182
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:58,649
were other colleagues from police forces

183
00:11:53,269 --> 00:12:04,040
tell us of for instance in this case sex

184
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:09,300
offender was being looked for was being

185
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:12,060
chaste aim is to find the bad guys and

186
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:17,339
so if we join forces and in this case

187
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:22,349
for instance is when the attacks took

188
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:24,510
place in Barcelona so the regional

189
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:27,050
police force were telling us what was

190
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,300
happening and we're trying to help and

191
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:33,240
reinforce and help them wherever

192
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:37,500
necessary and when we started with

193
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,020
Twitter we started with a hashtag we all

194
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:45,480
know what this is this is this part of

195
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:53,520
Twitter and then we created our own

196
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:56,820
which was gdt Twitter dia this forced us

197
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,160
to publish one to it a day telling

198
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,550
something telling something that would

199
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:07,260
be necessary it is true that we are

200
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:10,010
prioritized quality and not quantity so

201
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:12,900
we want to tell something that may be

202
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:16,200
useful for citizens so we came up with

203
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,740
this first profile always followed and

204
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:23,100
I'll tell you about them so we created

205
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:28,680
gdt alert profile with this a hashtag we

206
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:32,250
wanted to get to Twitter and Internode's

207
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,250
by telling them something by telling

208
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,280
them about a threat that perhaps we had

209
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:52,680
discovered in the Internet in this case

210
00:13:38,280 --> 00:14:01,640
its campaign about a fraud given sort of

211
00:13:52,680 --> 00:14:06,030
fraud and we also produce videos we

212
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:12,740
create gdt news for instance in order to

213
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:12,740
you for instance since he launched this

214
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:28,610
forum we we also disseminate our own

215
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:31,279
news in this case riccati operation that

216
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,350
I've brought here to tell you about how

217
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,819
we start the working with social

218
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:42,440
networks because here we not only speak

219
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:49,219
about this operation but this operation

220
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:53,360
was something where we obtained many

221
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,339
telephone numbers related to potential

222
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,380
victims so you wouldn't imagine the

223
00:14:55,339 --> 00:15:00,889
amount of work trying to look at all

224
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:05,180
these victims so in our own website we

225
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:09,790
had a window we had an area in order to

226
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:14,449
ask people whether this person had been

227
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:17,599
ripped off so in this case we also

228
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:22,010
launched a video saying what the

229
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:26,889
operation was about and how it affected

230
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:37,790
victims and how these victims were

231
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:40,850
attracted or attacked was for this to be

232
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:46,819
easy to handle easy to understand in

233
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:51,470
order people to understand how these

234
00:15:46,819 --> 00:16:02,649
cyber criminals go to the victims and

235
00:15:51,470 --> 00:16:06,649
then we created this star hash tag this

236
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:09,350
DDT council thing here we tell people

237
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:15,160
how to avoid problems with the internet

238
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:20,569
how to avoid fraud scam

239
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:23,540
we used pictures images with which we

240
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:27,829
explained the different steps to be

241
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:30,439
taken in this case when we are sent a

242
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:34,910
typical message saying we are an alert 3

243
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:38,029
or 4 or call this bring this phone

244
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,939
number and these things are fake are not

245
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:44,540
true so in order to know whether this is

246
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:48,410
real piece of news or if it's just a

247
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:51,309
fake we give them advice in order to

248
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,709
tell people how to detect these things

249
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:58,639
so and we had a problem with this and

250
00:16:54,709 --> 00:17:00,439
this is that was somebody we were

251
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,079
through facebook said everything that

252
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:05,629
you're telling us is wonderful you guys

253
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:08,240
but whenever you send us an image a

254
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,250
picture we cannot see it we cannot read

255
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,359
it because we've got a special software

256
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:18,319
that reads out what you tell us but it

257
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:24,708
doesn't translate what's in the picture

258
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:28,220
so in a basic sort of way what we do is

259
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:32,570
the following we transcribe what we have

260
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:35,330
in the picture we tell what's in the

261
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:41,870
picture we explain it we're trying to

262
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:44,270
make this a much user friendly and we're

263
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,860
collaborating also with the Association

264
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:50,870
for the blind in order to make sure that

265
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:56,809
we reach out bigger audience here we

266
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:59,689
also launched many tips throughout the

267
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:04,760
day basics security in Internet in

268
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:08,659
mobile phones and also holidays through

269
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:12,379
the internet security when buying online

270
00:18:08,659 --> 00:18:14,600
security with smartphones holidays

271
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,409
digital security and something that's

272
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,240
very important

273
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:23,730
the danger of dangerous communities

274
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,690
and we launched this because we started

275
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:30,870
detecting too much movement in certain

276
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:38,490
media related to the problem of blue

277
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:42,239
whales before serious problems happen in

278
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:47,010
Spain different security forces who are

279
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:51,870
launching these alerts just if in case

280
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:53,879
any kids were going into these games and

281
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:58,409
these are no games by the way these are

282
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:03,590
activities these are things where kids

283
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,590
had to keep passing a series of tests

284
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:11,700
harming themselves during themselves

285
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:16,530
harm and the last test had to do with

286
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:20,190
committing suicide for pouring frozen

287
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:26,160
water freezing water over their heads

288
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:29,010
and then boiling water burning

289
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,930
themselves and doing horrible things so

290
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:38,180
this is what we're trying to avoid

291
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:41,820
and we also so what we want to do is to

292
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:45,900
address these messages to more

293
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:49,790
vulnerable groups like people with

294
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:54,360
special needs the elderly our dear cyber

295
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:59,990
grandmas and grandpas and to this for

296
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:07,649
the children we created these DDT G DDT

297
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:10,350
councils was very small kids and they

298
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,660
need to read these messages together

299
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:15,090
with their parents because kids need to

300
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:19,410
be at least 14 in order to go into

301
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:21,689
social networks so we launched videos in

302
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:23,520
order for them to view them to watch

303
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,450
them together with their parents or

304
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,450
family members

305
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:34,190
in theory supposedly there's some music

306
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,340
to this there's a soundtrack there's

307
00:20:34,190 --> 00:21:13,070
some music to it something that little

308
00:20:37,340 --> 00:21:16,159
kids like very much uniformly cantata we

309
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:21,770
also launched some campaigns and special

310
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:32,510
days like the internet safe and secure

311
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:38,870
day some special days like May 17th for

312
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:41,720
instance the world internet day thanks

313
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:45,639
to the collaboration of celebrities in

314
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,140
the field of cybersecurity sports or TV

315
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:52,420
with the help of these people we

316
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:57,200
launched some video clips with tips and

317
00:21:52,420 --> 00:22:00,140
we are asking people to record these

318
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,170
things as professionally as possible

319
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:08,240
because the idea was of these videos to

320
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:13,010
reach out to citizens and I'll show you

321
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,490
an example of a comedian on the or

322
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,490
Olivia

323
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:28,220
[Music]

324
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,950
now tell me this

325
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:36,220
there's simply no computer don't forget

326
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:39,440
to always keep copy back haha

327
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:42,880
because in case your system has failure

328
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,920
or if it is attacked by a cyber criminal

329
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,900
so that you won't be able to access your

330
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:53,110
professional information the good thing

331
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:59,270
the best thing to do is to retrieve this

332
00:22:53,110 --> 00:23:03,320
with safety security copy the backup

333
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,889
that you have that is always ready to be

334
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:09,460
used

335
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:14,540
remember this thanks to the help of

336
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:17,410
influencers easy way to reach out to

337
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:23,389
citizen so far I've been speaking about

338
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:28,460
information we provide social networks

339
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:30,470
information for citizens for us the

340
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,790
information we get is much more

341
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:39,920
important citizens collaboration and

342
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:43,250
thanks to this portal for us this is

343
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:45,190
like a radar in order to know what's

344
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,980
going on in the internet because

345
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:55,390
unfortunately no matter how much we want

346
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:58,430
to cyber crews or cyber patrol we cannot

347
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:00,830
reach out and reach everywhere so

348
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:06,350
through these communications we can find

349
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:10,129
out about new ways of crime or criminal

350
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:14,120
campaigns which back for instance

351
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:15,140
there's a typical case which once in a

352
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,580
while

353
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:22,130
shows up again we see this blue screen

354
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,080
in our computer asking us to dial a

355
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,929
telephone number

356
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:33,570
I know they want us to all they wanted

357
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:37,230
is to ask my money from us

358
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:40,090
for instance this gets through this

359
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,509
collaborate portal where they speak

360
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:47,549
about sort of prime through a platform a

361
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:50,320
citizen is doing an improper use of

362
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:52,440
buying and selling platform so we

363
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:57,189
analyze all this

364
00:24:52,440 --> 00:25:00,220
and if it is criminal campaign we launch

365
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:10,559
our hashtags will launch our contents

366
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:15,909
through YouTube and through pictures and

367
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:19,259
if there are reasons to start criminal

368
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:23,320
proceedings we start with our

369
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:27,809
investigation and we report the judge of

370
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:31,450
course we don't work if there is no

371
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:35,070
order from or no no warrant from the

372
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:38,289
judge asking our students we are always

373
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:45,119
reporting judges and this is useful also

374
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:49,408
to report to the technology crime

375
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:55,178
prosecutors office the prosecutor is

376
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:57,970
always informed and updated and they

377
00:25:55,179 --> 00:26:00,609
know what is currently going on on the

378
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:05,429
internet and if the prosecutor's office

379
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:09,330
requires it we collect information

380
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:11,679
regarding for example crimes of hatred

381
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:13,689
the recent case of

382
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,009
the death of the general States

383
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:22,419
prosecutor is an example of this I

384
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:25,840
repeat all the crimes committed through

385
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:29,190
new technologies and which are related

386
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,709
to terrorism are dealt with by

387
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,340
specialized groups if we receive this

388
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,320
kind of information we

389
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:40,970
that information to that department this

390
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,070
is a crime of cyber terrorism we refer

391
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:46,039
that information to the group the

392
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,590
specific group as I said imagine that we

393
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:52,610
get information regarding animal abuse

394
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:55,010
then we refer that information to the

395
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:58,699
Department of the civil god that is in

396
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:02,629
charge of that if the crime has to do

397
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:06,200
with road traffic we refer all the

398
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:08,210
information to the corresponding unit or

399
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,710
Department this is an example of a

400
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:17,510
recent case only three weeks ago

401
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:22,610
somebody said that he read in a forum

402
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:26,960
that someone was saying that he was

403
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:29,510
going to commit suicide so we read the

404
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:34,250
comment and it was actually a farewell

405
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:37,490
from somebody he was saying it my in a

406
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,559
forum it is not our competence but we

407
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:43,039
couldn't waste any more time so we had

408
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:45,289
to verify the information thanks to the

409
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,230
cooperation of the forum we found out

410
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:51,620
more information about this person we

411
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:56,860
located that person and found out that

412
00:27:51,620 --> 00:28:00,080
he had attempted suicide before so we

413
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:04,039
reported this to our colleagues in the

414
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,879
city where this person lived and our

415
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:10,039
colleagues made it in time this guy had

416
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,190
already taken some pills but our

417
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:17,960
colleagues made it in time and were able

418
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:20,870
to save him so we feel very proud that

419
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,299
we are able to avoid and prevent this

420
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:26,330
kind of situation with the support of

421
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:30,320
the citizens we also receive all the

422
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:33,020
sorts of information for example this

423
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:38,480
person here says I lost my purse with

424
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:40,000
IDs passports and credit cards we tell

425
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,470
them

426
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:49,810
we're not competent to work on this this

427
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:52,840
message actually was coming from Romania

428
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:56,590
and we don't know how they work there so

429
00:28:52,840 --> 00:29:00,399
what we did was refer that person to the

430
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:03,850
pertinent authorities and his country

431
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,980
sometimes we get requests for

432
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,219
information there to have little to do

433
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,980
with our work for example good morning

434
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,820
my child is 8 years old and he's 1 meter

435
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:18,820
40 centimeters high does he need a chair

436
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:24,310
in the car well that's something we

437
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:28,990
cannot answer some things cannot be

438
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:30,940
dealt with by us however we try to give

439
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:37,900
them an answer and refer them to the

440
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:40,810
appropriate Department there is also the

441
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,570
risk of confusion between dgt which is

442
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:46,899
the general department for road traffic

443
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:51,100
in Spain and gdt which is the acronym

444
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:54,040
for our units that's why we received for

445
00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:03,550
example this warning from somebody and

446
00:29:54,040 --> 00:30:06,100
Twitter they said that well the civil

447
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,200
guard guys were trying to make some

448
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:12,340
money and that's why they were

449
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:17,050
patrolling and put in tickets for for

450
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:19,570
over speeding on the roads and well

451
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:22,629
since we are not in charge of road

452
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:26,379
traffic and security we responded within

453
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:30,220
all the twits say and well we are very

454
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:32,560
grateful for your kind remark but we are

455
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,800
not in charge of road traffic actually

456
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,050
the street went viral and a lot of funny

457
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:43,260
comments came afterwards but that's

458
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:45,340
definitely not our intention yesterday

459
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:50,110
somebody

460
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:55,330
was asking us yesterday where he could

461
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:58,300
find a toy for his daughter well we had

462
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,760
to give an answer it's not police action

463
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,399
but behind the crimes and behind

464
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:06,790
everything we do we are human beings and

465
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,870
if that little girl was longing so much

466
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:12,760
for that toy

467
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:15,629
well moved us and we decided to help

468
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,340
people and that's actually our

469
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:21,610
motivation people's thankfulness I

470
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:26,230
started my presentation by quoting the

471
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:27,520
8th article of the civil guard statement

472
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,970
and I'm going to finish with another

473
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:34,840
statement which is the satisfaction of

474
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:38,380
the accomplished duty and this is our

475
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:42,600
motivation at the civil guard we always

476
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:47,620
try to support and protect citizens and

477
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:50,679
my final word is we are here if you need

478
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,439

479
