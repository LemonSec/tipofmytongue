1
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:28,590
and when it goes off so well I've been

2
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,080
introduced but I repeat it again my name

3
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,729
is Kabir Rodrigo I come from Centinela

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,339
raise your hand if you from sent in

5
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:40,529
there good now I'm responsible for the

6
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,220
intelligence and front department at

7
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,040
Thai logic and actually my background is

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,290
in the public sector the operative

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,309
central unity well in a nutshell this is

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,949
what I used to do the classical police

11
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:59,580
work and this is what I'm doing now the

12
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,879
difference between the two may seem huge

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:06,420
but it's actually very small the company

14
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,729
I work for works on cyber security among

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,280
us all the things I don't know if ever

16
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,830
done pen testing auditing consultants

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,240
say well if not you will probably do

18
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,870
this kind of thing in the future the pen

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,679
testing which are attacks that go a long

20
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:28,080
time and then the intelligence the Red

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,970
Team I was talking about and then the

22
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,250
intelligence that is really really

23
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,530
important since we have a lot of

24
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,860
attendance here I'm going to say a few

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,610
things about Cantabria we are far from

26
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:46,650
Cantabria which means people from the

27
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:48,750
mountains it's a pretty rainy area and

28
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,820
this is the price we have to pay if we

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,700
want to have this beautiful greenery we

30
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,830
have a lot of good stuff for example so

31
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,810
boughs I don't know if you've tried them

32
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:03,150
because they are delicious and the NED

33
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,010
mountains and some more things that I

34
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,870
would like to take the opportunity to

35
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,330
talk about it I've worked in Madrid for

36
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:12,569
several years but something I noticed is

37
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,190
that we are never present in the weather

38
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,619
focus there's something I always wonder

39
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,599
or why

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,870
our traditional dishes get different

41
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:26,099
names in Spain we also have our

42
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:30,629
particular words that we only use on

43
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:34,079
this part of the world so now I'm going

44
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:39,238
to go to the nitty-gritty cyber

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,989
intelligence what is it about this is

46
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,940
probably one of the most widely used

47
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:46,980
terms in cybersecurity we're going to

48
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,900
talk about intelligence about cyber

49
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,840
intelligence we're going to define what

50
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,620
it is not cyber intelligence we will see

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,530
an example of industrial espionage and

52
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,349
then we will draw some conclusions first

53
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,840
of all what can we know what can we say

54
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:08,099
about cyber intelligence here we have

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,920
some headlines cyber intelligence ghost

56
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,709
one step beyond in cyber tech

57
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,510
Prevention's blah blah blah you've

58
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,329
probably heard about it it seems that

59
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,450
cyber intelligence is there it is taken

60
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:23,310
care of as almost like a Montek scare of

61
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:31,608
her child as in this picture it's

62
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:37,980
something that protects you let's begin

63
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:39,989
by defining intelligence once we do that

64
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,328
and once we understand what intelligence

65
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,400
is we will apply it we are plant we will

66
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:46,889
apply the concept to cyber intelligence

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,069
intelligence is providing useful

68
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,829
information and I underline useful

69
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:56,060
because 200 pages report may not be

70
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:59,220
useful so useful information that

71
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:02,430
enables decision making or the

72
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,440
modification of a decision so this is

73
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,980
the important thing it is a useful thing

74
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,079
that saves time to decision-makers I

75
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,569
have a problem I received some kind of

76
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:17,010
data that helped me make the right

77
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:18,889
decisions therefore I reduce uncertainty

78
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,108
[Music]

79
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:25,560
intelligence has been a widely used word

80
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:27,109
throughout time it was Sherman Kent the

81
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,569
father of

82
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,879
the intelligence as we understand it

83
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:35,569
today he worked at the OSS the

84
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:39,080
predecessor of CIA during the second

85
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:41,740
world war make trouble very troublesome

86
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,258
times so this guy would just collect

87
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,900
information from the bad guys so to say

88
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:50,090
the Japanese in this case and he would

89
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,840
turn that information into useful

90
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,878
information for the command that

91
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,628
information enabled documented to make

92
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:04,699
the right decisions once the world was

93
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:06,110
over he realized that this was his way

94
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:08,659
of doing things but there were many

95
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,550
other ways of doing things that's why he

96
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:12,080
decided to write this book so that you

97
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,190
get intelligence for American world

98
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,508
policy what it basically says is let's

99
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,960
set some rules

100
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:23,300
let's turn intelligence into a

101
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,258
discipline rather than an art and let's

102
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:30,169
shape it so that it can be applied to

103
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:33,199
any field whatsoever so this is a

104
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,940
fundamental pillar this book is so he

105
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,740
basically said that there are four main

106
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,610
processes Direction collection

107
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:43,969
processing and dissemination these are

108
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:47,000
actually stages we have the direction

109
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:48,560
phase that is someone coming up to me

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,960
and saying well I have this problem I

111
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,360
need to know more about this then the

112
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,870
next stage is about collecting

113
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,080
information about that matter then there

114
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,199
is an elaboration phase an analyst or an

115
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,279
expert will take that information and

116
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,349
turn it into a report present the

117
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:12,770
product so to say product is a synonym

118
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:14,930
for report in the intelligence world and

119
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,719
finally the dissemination the

120
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,240
dissemination that needs to go to

121
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:23,449
decision makers or the people who need

122
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,210
that kind of knowledge is it doesn't it

123
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:28,789
so we are at home we need to buy a drug

124
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,710
for example so I research on the

125
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:33,190
Internet I

126
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:38,680
some drugstores our addresses and then I

127
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:41,469
buy what I need every country has its

128
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,990
own cycle and the National Intelligence

129
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,750
Center in Spain has its own cycle of

130
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,820
they're all pretty much the same there

131
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:53,440
are several disciplines for example

132
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,760
oesn't or searching the internets it's a

133
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,340
bit more complicated than that people

134
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:01,420
think that intelligence is about this a

135
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:04,359
guy in a hat spying and stealing data

136
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:06,850
but it's rather more like what you can

137
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,220
see on the picture it's a huge vast

138
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:12,580
amount of information that a unity

139
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:15,520
analyze understand report on that is a

140
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,520
great problem and finally this all of

141
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,500
this information is given to

142
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,229
decision-maker so for the intelligence

143
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,230
we need specialized staff this is not

144
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:30,490
about sitting at my desk and collecting

145
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:32,230
information analyzing and given the

146
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,390
information away it takes more than that

147
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:39,820
we need specialized staff who knows

148
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,190
about how to collect who knows about the

149
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,370
collection technique whether it is on

150
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:48,719
the internet or looking for a pathway or

151
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:55,000
a route in Google Maps for example and

152
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:58,750
this is also human maybe you won't

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,520
believe this in the 21st century but it

154
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,830
is so I don't know if you've ever heard

155
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,549
of a thing called a letter that was a

156
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:09,969
piece of paper folded inside an envelope

157
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:12,130
and sent to somebody else

158
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:17,550
well this is what my grandfather used to

159
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:22,420
do anyway we need personal staff

160
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:25,870
specialized analysis we also need a

161
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:28,450
cycle manager the boss that's very easy

162
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:31,270
to find in Spain and then the

163
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,819
decision-maker the one that receives the

164
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,960
final product and makes the right

165
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,960
decision that is a politician

166
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,350
in case we are talking about the public

167
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,450
sector here they all require

168
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:48,400
specialization with the exception of the

169
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:52,390
politician so the decision-maker maybe

170
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,279
the CEO it could be the pharmacist in

171
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,069
your neighborhood but it could be any of

172
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,820
us it's actually the person who has the

173
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,110
final word so what do we have up to now

174
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,020
intelligence is about a series of

175
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:08,080
processes related to the collection of

176
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:11,189
information from several sources they

177
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,690
are then analyzed reported and

178
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:18,250
disseminated to someone who needs that

179
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:21,520
information so this means you know there

180
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:24,040
for you to do your work right need to

181
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,650
know about what I am doing do you need

182
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,829
to know information from a report I can

183
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:32,199
draft it is as simple as that but it

184
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:36,970
causes a lot of problems at the same

185
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:39,990
time and especially in the private

186
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,940
companies as we don't have that mindset

187
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:51,400
so what can we do with intelligence many

188
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:53,890
different things now you can attach the

189
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:58,390
word cyber to any other word and it

190
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:01,500
would make it look very modern so any

191
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:04,180
way we can have territorial intelligence

192
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,950
regulation intelligence competitive or

193
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,650
economic intelligence that's what we're

194
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,110
going to be talking about military

195
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,230
intelligence as well I have put this

196
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:17,730
asterisk here because everything comes

197
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:20,380
from the military image intelligence

198
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,000
this is what we do with world maps where

199
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,209
can I go and have a drink afterwards

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,200
and signal intelligence and finally do

201
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:31,089
diligence which is nothing but

202
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:35,589
investigating in order to find out more

203
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:37,800
about what somebody is doing based on

204
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:42,370
your interests and then the cyber

205
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:45,280
intelligence which is everywhere here it

206
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:51,280
is and here is how we figure

207
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:55,780
in our heads nobody can agree on what

208
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:58,360
this really is a bad we've seen that

209
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:01,689
cyber intelligence is about a set of

210
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:06,840
processes by which I collect analyze and

211
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:09,840
generate everything and what happens

212
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:13,270
[Music]

213
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,780
this comes from the private sector where

214
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:19,900
we all are and the public sector that

215
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,730
would encompass the come in the

216
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:26,470
intelligence community the National

217
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:29,340
Intelligence Service police etc so here

218
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,130
are some definitions we need to are

219
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,800
predict cyber attacks by recollecting

220
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:37,300
information in from the cyber world the

221
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,490
obtention of information from the

222
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,729
cyberspace in order to process it and

223
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,730
many more definitions so intelligence is

224
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:49,030
everywhere but cyber intelligence as

225
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:51,460
such doesn't exist it is all a lie well

226
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:55,689
there are a few new answers to it the

227
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:58,720
intelligence is all about cyberspace so

228
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,150
bear something in mind cyber

229
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:06,220
intelligence is collected from human

230
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:11,140
sources what is the source the human

231
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:13,630
knowledge I can see or I can learn from

232
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:17,949
somebody from a place and from the

233
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:23,110
cyberspace so cyber intelligence or

234
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:26,710
cyber space are not the goal but a

235
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:31,060
source of information this is something

236
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:34,960
that we need to bear in mind although

237
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:38,500
the term has been evolving there is an

238
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,290
explanation to it since now cyber

239
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,930
intelligence is linked to the classical

240
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:47,469
malware analysis well my family are here

241
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:50,290
watching me so I would say to my mom a

242
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,820
malware is nothing about a virus that is

243
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,550
the bug that goes inside to your

244
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,780
computer and starts doing strange things

245
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,469
and then you have to call a friend to

246
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,470
help you out

247
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:04,998
so it has to do with that and we're

248
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,279
processing information the good thing

249
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:09,799
about the computer size is that we can

250
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,959
process fast amounts of information so

251
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:16,160
here is where the problems begin if we

252
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,488
have a problem

253
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,279
an attack affecting a computer system is

254
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:24,139
giving us information about the

255
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,059
technique that was used but we don't

256
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:29,839
know what happened

257
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:31,999
I mean who did it and why they did it I

258
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,759
don't know if you've ever done reverse

259
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:39,799
engineering or not you're going to get

260
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:43,209
some information that analysis will tell

261
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:45,499
you how good or how bad that virus is

262
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:48,049
it'll tell you a little bit more about

263
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:53,629
the sophistication etc but you will

264
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:57,829
never know who did it and why so what do

265
00:13:53,629 --> 00:14:05,389
we have a technical information source

266
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:09,439
nothing but that so I've seen on the

267
00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:12,790
internet many strange things and I'm

268
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:16,669
going to focus now where all these

269
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:19,160
confusions are arise from this is

270
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:22,249
something that we've created in order to

271
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,629
explain this flow a little bit we have

272
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:26,439
the computer

273
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:31,999
my grandfather's computer here which

274
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:35,480
contains a virus so the computers

275
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:37,519
running slowly or whatever that virus is

276
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,829
connected to a control panel that is

277
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,279
telling the virus what to do it's as

278
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:47,118
simple as that and then there is some

279
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,009
hacker that is controlling everything so

280
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,589
we have four actors although it looks

281
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,299
like for the virus my grandfather's

282
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:56,749
computer the control panel and the

283
00:14:53,299 --> 00:15:00,108
hacker so this is a very very basic

284
00:14:56,749 --> 00:15:01,970
scheme of what amal were and the viruses

285
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:03,379
there are more complicated ones but I

286
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,549
think this is pretty straightforward

287
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:08,660
isn't it ok is it clear so far so what

288
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:14,370
saw happened

289
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:18,899
obviously the more viruses I can analyze

290
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:20,910
the better I will be if I analyze at ten

291
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,830
thousand different computers well I'd

292
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:30,660
have ten thousand grandmother's anyway

293
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:33,510
so if I have access to many to lots of

294
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,000
malware or be very good and I'll have

295
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:39,870
very a lot of information about these

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,899
ten thousand pieces of malware so the

297
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:46,050
more well the more information and I'll

298
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:48,120
have them will learn IP addresses

299
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,550
they're connected to you and will sorts

300
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,580
of viruses technical information because

301
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,800
it comes from a technical analysis and

302
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,110
apart from this we have many more things

303
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,589
and especially lots of information from

304
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:04,649
open sources in the records I see

305
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:07,470
there's a lot of information from open

306
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:10,279
source internet and not so open

307
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:13,890
sometimes so now I keep these items

308
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:16,090
these are expensive and very expensive

309
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,360
and studies

310
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,610
[Music]

311
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,850
so actually what we have here is lots of

312
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:27,980
information that's built around a virus

313
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:33,779
or system that's been attacked but

314
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:37,950
that's been breached starts information

315
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:41,339
there are very bad people

316
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:43,890
Putin etc and other things like machine

317
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:46,260
learning etcetera so what we're seeing

318
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:49,199
is that the tendency is that I have a

319
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,329
piece of software I analyze and I'll say

320
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,820
that I'm a Rotter where I'm Russian I'm

321
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:55,829
a Russian one guy that's fascinating

322
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,529
right and this comes from a Sherlock

323
00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:01,500
Holmes and paradox because he would say

324
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:05,280
there he was in a building where there

325
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:08,130
was a murder every day so Sherlock

326
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,428
Holmes would say it's been somebody from

327
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,500
within somebody inside big my ghostess

328
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:19,230
colleague because when

329
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:24,900
the somebody dies dog does bike so it's

330
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:28,740
a solid evidence Sherlock Holmes thing

331
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:31,440
so what happens with all this war cyber

332
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,090
intelligence Department normally does or

333
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,659
somebody who's into cyber intelligence

334
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:39,090
and please remember the aim of this to

335
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:41,850
provide useful information there's a

336
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:45,240
bunch of systems that you or America

337
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:47,969
software analyses collect information

338
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,890
automated software that classifies this

339
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,039
and that mashanda and we've got a bunch

340
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:56,880
of specialized there people who analyze

341
00:17:52,039 --> 00:18:03,390
malware and people you go look for the

342
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:06,620
virus and there's assembles it and puts

343
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:10,350
it apart in everything so basically

344
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:12,600
comes the event and they take the piece

345
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,850
of software or the computer and they do

346
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,879
a technical report so the product they

347
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:22,408
create remember intelligent product is

348
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:25,350
repo the brilliant reports because they

349
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:27,440
take a virus or malware and they write

350
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:32,389
an incredible report but I saw with the

351
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:36,659
Chinese the Indian always Russians and

352
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:39,179
so and the quality is high we go it must

353
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:43,320
be an essay so through a software piece

354
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:46,980
I can elaborate all this and if wiki

355
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:51,149
leaks agrees that must be a trip and

356
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:55,289
Putin Putin's always there yes say hello

357
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:57,330
and ok so far so good so we've looked at

358
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:59,510
the definition and I want you to take

359
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,070
home the definition of intelligence

360
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,020
classical definition and what happens

361
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,389
with cyber intelligence which is

362
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:11,908
something that still

363
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:14,519
coming I mean nothing landed yet not all

364
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:16,440
the way is in the information that Putin

365
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,630
must give us and the best way to

366
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,460
understand this is to use a case of

367
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:27,659
industrial spying and this is something

368
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:30,000
that is happening so these attacks do

369
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:32,580
occur so let's see well from the time

370
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,110
when somebody feels like attacking an

371
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,158
infrastructure in order to obtain

372
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:40,350
information all the phases or stages he

373
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:46,610
or she goes through until this reaches

374
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:50,059
the analyst for instance I picked

375
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:53,639
pharmacy industry for instance of

376
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:55,740
pharmaceuticals this company this

377
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:58,260
industry this company operates in

378
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:02,279
several countries 70 by the way 70% of

379
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,110
GDP this generated our service fame the

380
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,120
thing about the crisis is that many

381
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:09,899
Spanish companies said well we have to

382
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:12,268
go international well in Spain so here

383
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:14,668
there are several research lines and

384
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:16,320
this company competes on an

385
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:19,250
international level something that's

386
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,809
normally a Warner doesn't need to go to

387
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,460
sophisticated companies in order to

388
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:26,940
understand that there are smaller

389
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:30,870
companies that got international that go

390
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,210
abroad they abroad and mean everything

391
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,100
outside this region cantebury it could

392
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,010
be somewhere else is fine so this

393
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:45,029
company has got a bunch of enemies

394
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:46,460
physical security for instance physical

395
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:50,700
security

396
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:55,950
there's also computer security or cyber

397
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:58,620
security and some here well so this is a

398
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:02,450
company you operate abroad normally has

399
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:05,100
a risk map

400
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,680
whatever country they go to so there may

401
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,379
be somebody from the competition maybe

402
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:14,520
packed or supported by governments or

403
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:17,190
whatever and whole set of enemies when

404
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:20,780
I'm speaking about competitive

405
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,130
competitive company supported by our

406
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,210
enemies well there are some companies

407
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:30,270
with an economic intelligence sector and

408
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:34,710
for instance a country will tell you my

409
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:38,700
companies for me are my GDP children

410
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,800
generating companies so the more GDP

411
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,470
they generate the better so you guys

412
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,710
both companies in Italy the US or

413
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:49,080
whatever every work outside and bring

414
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,940
money are healthy and I'll give you a

415
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,070
resources there's lots of literature

416
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,790
about this and a lot of it is true is it

417
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:04,260
this is no secret and it makes sense

418
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:07,080
so we are pharmaceutical company B and

419
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:10,500
we operate in a given country in for

420
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:13,050
instance we want to get some gain some

421
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,990
contracts get some contracts and we're

422
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:19,050
competing for the contract of a patent

423
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,480
in Australia so I have a problem because

424
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,100
I need to go to Australia but it's not

425
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,070
just me there are going to be companies

426
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,830
from other companies in this case a

427
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,750
pharmaceutical company a so we need

428
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,220
intelligence we need information we need

429
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,860
to know what that company is going to be

430
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,870
doing we want to know what the offer is

431
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:41,080
going to be we want to know about their

432
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:45,520
infrastructure I want to know it or so

433
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,290
is trade technical things so the more

434
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,879
information you have the better is my

435
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:54,070
country supporting me

436
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,950
yes I've resources then available we

437
00:22:54,070 --> 00:23:00,340
know that for instance China when

438
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:02,050
expanding abroad what they do is to get

439
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,909
information from other companies in

440
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,460
order to create its own I don't know

441
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:10,020
whether you like the world of aviation

442
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:13,900
well I hate it because I'm scared

443
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,629
shitless of that flying so in any case

444
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:21,760
and I'm saying this because Airbus which

445
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:25,110
is a European consortium builds

446
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:29,770
airplanes a model came out the a320

447
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:31,840
mid-range airplane about 320 they came

448
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,900
up with this model and it took the

449
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,179
Chinese 1020 years to 5 10 years to

450
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:39,970
build a woman exactly like I saw they

451
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:44,020
either stole and hide the whole

452
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:46,960
engineering team from Airbus or it was

453
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:50,680
that their government was helping them

454
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,720
supporting them so many people do these

455
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,330
things many countries so what I mean

456
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,650
first of all I need willingness and

457
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:03,909
resources so I what and I know that I

458
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:06,580
want to access data from pharmaceutical

459
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:09,580
company B and I have the necessary

460
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:13,659
resources in order to do it and if you

461
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:17,050
have all these resources sound great

462
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:20,470
and also great for the other company so

463
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,990
now we have a need and the need is to

464
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:25,390
know what's happening to a

465
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:30,040
pharmaceutical company a so we can

466
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:32,260
deploy our resources human resources and

467
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,639
interview workers workers we want to

468
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,640
swap jobs and

469
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,510
stakeholders right now we're in the

470
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:45,880
physical world I haven't said anything

471
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:52,950
about cyber nothing yet so we simulate a

472
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:59,740
bunch of things and yeah and yeah and we

473
00:24:52,950 --> 00:25:02,770
all said the idea is to obtain data that

474
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,660
are interested i'm pharmaceutical

475
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:08,520
company b and i don't want to be caught

476
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:12,370
so we speak about coverage coverage is

477
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:15,580
he is like a lid is like a shield

478
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:18,489
it's like covered for instance when i

479
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:23,649
was little i go home and my mother was

480
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:26,260
saying have you smoked a drum your

481
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:29,260
breath I can tell your eyes are

482
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,080
bloodshot so my mother's say I don't

483
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,000
believe you so now coverage is something

484
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,929
that's much more sophisticated this

485
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,410
means that the only thing that will

486
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:45,190
avoid legal problems is having a good

487
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:47,230
coverage of resources so we go back to

488
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:50,740
resources for instance I have to set up

489
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:54,460
a human resource company in order to

490
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,260
hire a worker skill or a change job this

491
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:59,050
is very confidential because the worker

492
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:01,870
who wants to goes to an interview

493
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,419
because they will not change jobs but

494
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:07,389
you don't know who they are

495
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:12,840
the pharmaceutical be a it's my problems

496
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:12,840
I know with our CEO is that is the boss

497
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:22,330
posh way of saying boss CEO so I can

498
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,760
depend on the company I can do this when

499
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,889
open source I read the papers or read

500
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,379
this and other companies when they

501
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:33,130
operate and they go to other countries

502
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:36,970
they say out loud and make sense they

503
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:39,610
want to be known visible so a

504
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,010
pharmaceutical company B says well I've

505
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,990
what I want

506
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,360
maybe I interviewed somebody who's just

507
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,910
involved in the country in the project I

508
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,500
have an Australia maybe he or she told

509
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,080
me everything everything that I wanted

510
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,720
no sir shall we go on or not maybe I

511
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,899
have to go on I know that if I wanna go

512
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:08,070
on I know who the company is I know you

513
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:10,410
know how they they operate mo for

514
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:15,049
instance information that come comes

515
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,049
from humans this is highly credible

516
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,690
information that come comes from open

517
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,790
sources unless you do a good screening

518
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,770
many things could happen for instance

519
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:29,639
you've been looking for something and

520
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:31,350
you find that 10,000 hits 10,000 the

521
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,510
Internet and this is school or the

522
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:40,320
Wikipedia and this is called the echo

523
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:42,390
effect so I see this obtained

524
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,540
information even though it's not viral

525
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:49,410
it gives me operational information from

526
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:51,450
the company so I'm here so I have all

527
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:55,410
these informations I'm going to go I'm

528
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:59,100
going to launch I'm gonna release I'm

529
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:01,140
gonna go for this cyber attack and the

530
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,590
idea is to get confidential information

531
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,100
on specific projects we know we have to

532
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:10,000
know then in these cases we have a final

533
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,699
objective

534
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,570
if I want to infect the whole world what

535
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:18,370
I want is money if i infect this

536
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:21,550
specific computer first of us because i

537
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:24,639
wasn't able to do it differently or

538
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:27,040
because I want this computer in order to

539
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,070
do it maybe I'll leave a whole bunch of

540
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,530
traces this is what's cool lateral

541
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:35,379
movement whatever resources obviously I

542
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:39,790
need somebody something that will allow

543
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:45,850
me to infect and this is the virus and

544
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:50,020
apart from this this virus mustn't relay

545
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:55,270
me like me to anything and also it's

546
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:57,639
going to be and entertaining and this

547
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:02,950
means that we need make nervous it's got

548
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:16,360
to be user friendly operation must be

549
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:29,020
secure the people know about something

550
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:32,290
the worse it is here the objective the

551
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:37,060
idea is not to be caught and the virus

552
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:42,820
most the whole operation everything that

553
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:45,929
is Lamar web has to be able to hide it

554
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:49,120
subject I have never seen anybody with

555
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:52,840
something written on their forehead

556
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,159
saying I'm gonna hack it and it's gonna

557
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,530
be simple we need to

558
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,650
get away from complexities it's got to

559
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:14,430
be simple we have several options we can

560
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:20,560
buy out-of-the-box virus something that

561
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:22,390
prefab we can buy with bitcoins sounds

562
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,230
horrible I know so you buy something

563
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:30,600
that's already been ready-made and

564
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:36,130
either you can take your granddad's

565
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:38,949
newspaper or sorry computer and modified

566
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:42,760
for instance wanna cry you know why no

567
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:46,150
cries so some people took that virus

568
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,970
modified it and there are things inside

569
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:51,730
of it and sent it around the world or an

570
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,990
ad hoc maguey but there's something new

571
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:56,250
when somebody does something new is that

572
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:59,760
[Music]

573
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:04,630
he hasn't been able to solve this with

574
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,250
existing alternatives after you have the

575
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,930
amount well remember what I showed you

576
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,180
at the beginning when I wanted to show

577
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,710
you what a virus looks like and then

578
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:17,920
there's another thing called the

579
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:20,560
dashboard or this is just a computer

580
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,780
system that linked to the virus and it

581
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,610
gives it instructions now you do this

582
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:29,710
now you're raised now this now that

583
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:31,209
simple so far so I need to have to buy

584
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:33,340
that server I have to create the

585
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:37,870
necessary infrastructure that will

586
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:41,439
support my attack and I did systems that

587
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:44,709
will make me anonymous so that I won't

588
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,470
be caught and also creating malware in

589
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:51,190
case I decide to create it and there's

590
00:31:47,470 --> 00:32:00,350
nothing called Stuxnet have you heard

591
00:31:51,190 --> 00:32:04,720
about Stuxnet you know Angelina Jolie

592
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:07,070
you guys sleeping are you hungry

593
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,010
this is something that was created by

594
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:11,689
the US and Israel because they had a

595
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:15,890
problem

596
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:19,309
Iran was building an atom bomb so what

597
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:21,260
did Israelis do and they said am I gonna

598
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:24,860
bomb them or should I create some sort

599
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:28,610
of virus that will go into their nuclear

600
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,729
plant in order to slow down their

601
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:35,870
operations I'm a scallop halo live in

602
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:37,940
stocks net this this was the first cyber

603
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,379
weapon that was used for that objective

604
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,230
Bert

605
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:45,350
well they didn't tell tell you Stuxnet

606
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,150
has been analyzed and reversed and

607
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,949
everything but what they don't tell you

608
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,760
is that the coverage they used were the

609
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,610
following

610
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,919
hey I need a certificate certificates

611
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:57,678
like one of those passports the

612
00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:01,880
diplomats have where the piece of virus

613
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,640
that tells the system illegal I am legal

614
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:09,110
so they took a certificate from China

615
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,850
from Taiwanese company they stole it

616
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,139
from the company from a company they

617
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,750
said oh listen I've got there's a

618
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,669
wonderful piece of software but what do

619
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,860
I do with it so they collected lots of

620
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:22,220
information not technical information

621
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,990
but human information so they collected

622
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:28,850
lots of information to see how they

623
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:31,340
could where they could stick this so we

624
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:34,789
have everything we know the company and

625
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:40,459
I always say the same thing we want to

626
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:44,270
act the will is there and objective is

627
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:45,950
clear so how do we get in well this is a

628
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,900
flowchart of the company and this is

629
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,870
what you can find and it's a large

630
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,240
company with X workers now going there

631
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:57,139
to see what you do well we think that

632
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:01,370
the CEO is the important guy of the boss

633
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:03,679
of the important guy but our experience

634
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:06,110
and after analyzing these things maybe

635
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,330
the secretary is more important than the

636
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,750
CEO

637
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:14,110
as the CEOs secretary or the people who

638
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,880
are in charge of payrolls people who've

639
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:22,090
been working for the company for 20

640
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:25,630
years and normal times but all the

641
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:27,520
informations go formation goes through

642
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,110
them this is something you don't see in

643
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,130
the Internet and the internet you may

644
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:34,870
see a flow chart but what with other

645
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,670
things and there's nothing we need to

646
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:40,029
understand and that's is emerging

647
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:43,139
possibilities here I've analyzed the

648
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:46,120
people by person by person what they do

649
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:50,139
and what department I can have

650
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,179
everything well structured there's

651
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,339
something called emerging properties a

652
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:58,149
company is a community of individuals

653
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:00,820
from sitting down around a common

654
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:03,010
objective and they make up community

655
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:06,160
communities include what we call

656
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:09,610
emerging properties an example here

657
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:13,450
we're all civilized but if we go to you

658
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:16,360
the soccer stadium all of some you guys

659
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:21,339
start going crazy not because you're

660
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:23,920
crazy because there's pressure pressure

661
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:28,660
the communities are changed and because

662
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:32,580
everything so companies are not just

663
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:35,500
made by people made up by people but

664
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:39,759

you believe it or not but in the end we

668
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:51,460
all want to do different things thing we

669
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,970
want to make a difference with what we

670

do differently

once so once know about this once I

673
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:09,288
understand all this and I'm not gonna

674

say here we're gonna be hittin Anika is

675
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:15,019
the only cyber thing we've done is the

676
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:18,499
virus and what the evil and the virus is

677
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:21,379
the weapon I need in order to continue

678
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:26,569
and getting information there's not the

679
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:29,630
end of the virus infection vector this

680
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:34,099
is the gate I'm going to go in through

681
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:40,720
zero what kind of gate is is we have two

682
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:40,720
types of vectors we have the record rich

683
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:51,980
zero day which means that zero days when

684

your mother catches you when you say you

685
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,980
were gonna go somewhere you were not

686
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:59,029
gonna go somewhere and all of a sudden

687
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:03,410
she gets you to them and in order to buy

688
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:07,089
this you need resources and go back to

689
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:10,819
the same thing do I need to do all this

690
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:13,160
do I need to buy this cyber weapon in

691
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:17,950
order to get this well in general no you

692
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:20,720
don't need to go that far some specific

693
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:26,328
scenarios were perhaps you need to but

694
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:29,899
not always and most we have the virus I

695
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:33,470
have the virus I can do something which

696
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:39,289
is the classical operational things I

697
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:43,220
can go to a hotel and do something some

698
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:44,890
hacking technical procedures I can go

699
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,649
into a computer I

[Music]

701
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:54,790
connect the computer by the way by the

702
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:57,070
way everything I'm telling you another

703
00:37:54,790 --> 00:38:00,100
some of you look surprised but it's true

704
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:03,310
the world is ugly what happens outside

705
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:08,680
our house is ugly the world has changed

706
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:13,600
a lot and when my interests clash with

707
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:18,569
yours what I'll do is do that way what

708
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:22,299
you have for instance hotels where

709
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:24,850
informations been manipulated and for

710
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:28,270
instance somebody could how hardware in

711
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:31,950
your computer when staying at a hotel so

712
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:38,980
and then we have the normal sort of

713
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:41,830
vectors when I want to do something and

714
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:45,430
have the necessary resources I don't say

715
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:52,060
an email pretending that I'm some banco

716
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:55,419
santander when BBVA you've no money in

717
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:58,240
Bank result on that so I need to have a

718
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,150
coverage that's believable because the

719
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,359
idea is for you to believe me means

720
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:09,070
whatever target my target is whatever my

721
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:10,720
objective was ever he's got to do

722
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:15,190
something that's gonna be a click and

723
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:19,240
it's got to be realistic or believable

724
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:23,050
and who do i attack for instance when

725
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:26,740
you throw water on the floor water does

726
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,310
something you throw glass of water on

727
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,720
the floor

728
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,509
[Music]

729
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,700
and water just runs and this happens

730
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:37,910
this is the same thing that happens with

731
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:41,660
the attacker they they're not gonna go

732
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:46,399
into complex things no they want things

733
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:53,828
done easily without having to spend too

734
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:57,589
much resources in the case of Stuxnet

735
00:39:53,829 --> 00:40:00,430
the Israeli virus we talked about they

736
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:03,230
said that the easiest way to go in was

737
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:06,769
through suppliers companies have

738
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:09,289
suppliers people they trust people they

739
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:13,160
do business with and with whom they have

740
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:15,559
a special link that's why the most

741
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,348
dangerous attacks come through these

742
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:20,390
suppliers as opposed are usually small

743
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:24,289
companies so there is something very

744
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:27,710
easy that we can do we can call them on

745
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:31,579
the phone via social engineering and

746
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:33,650
establish a relationship we can ask do

747
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:37,759
you sell chewing gum well I'm very

748
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:39,559
interested in chewing gum maybe they

749
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:41,779
also send products for the

750
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:43,839
pharmaceutical sector but that's not the

751
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:46,789
matter the matter is to establish a

752
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:52,220
relationship to start some kind of

753
00:40:46,789 --> 00:41:04,220
process that they can believe in the

754
00:40:52,220 --> 00:41:06,649
past we can use PDF or web files any

755
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:11,720
file any sort of I will want this is a

756
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:13,069
bit more complicated because a zero-day

757
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,788
for example doesn't require the

758
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:21,019
interaction of people so using the

759
00:41:16,789 --> 00:41:23,569
supplier trick we go in and this way we

760
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:26,328
can obtain all the information we need

761
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:29,869
related to that pharmaceutical company

762
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:33,859
called a and maybe information about

763
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:36,970
Company B - so what's important here is

764
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:40,400
that while this is all happening our

765
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:44,209
contact with the supplier continues

766
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,860
because we don't want to be caught so

767
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:50,390
this company a has a wonderful cyber

768
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:55,790
intelligence department and what do they

769
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:59,690
do well basically the cyber intelligence

770
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:06,770
department people correlate computer

771
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:09,800
related events they perform a lot of

772
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:13,000
analysis as we've explained before but

773
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:16,910
they haven't sniffed anything yet I

774
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,280
learn a lot from people from red team

775
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:22,520
because they simulate this kind of

776
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:27,980
attack a lot and the truth is they

777
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:32,150
aren't aware of anything why is that

778
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:34,520
because cyber intelligence today is

779
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:37,880
focused on the technical side because

780
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:44,060
that's like the solid like the strongest

781
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:45,770
part because if I am cyber attacked that

782
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,590
entails that there are a lot of faces

783
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:51,370
that I haven't looked at before then

784
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,930
there's the issue of alarms you've

785
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:57,350
probably been in the situation where

786
00:42:53,930 --> 00:43:00,470
your antivirus has popped up so this

787
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:03,049
means that the antivirus is intelligence

788
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,330
has told you that you have a virus but

789
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:06,920
the problem is already there that's not

790
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:11,230
intelligence intelligence is about

791
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,230
predicting that that is going to happen

792
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,730
then the questions basic questions on

793
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:24,170
intelligence are the ones from last

794
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:26,810
world's paradigm whose is what to whom

795
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:31,880
through which channel and with which

796
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:33,830
goal because when I get the on from the

797
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,140
antivirus this means that the virus is

798
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:39,110
already there so as I said before it's

799
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:42,379
too late so what do we have a few months

800
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:45,110
months after words continuing continuing

801
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,510
with our story well one of these senses

802
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:50,930
and the company generates an alarm based

803
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:53,360
on a new rule that was created through

804
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:57,830
cyber intelligence

805
00:43:53,360 --> 00:44:01,220
so a development department they

806
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:06,080
developed forensic analysis they detect

807
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:08,270
malware they create reports etc and what

808
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:11,750
they say is that this is a very serious

809
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:15,440
attack done by whom by the Russians of

810
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:19,190
course here they are again this pudding

811
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:23,540
is so unlucky I don't know if you know

812
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:25,850
this fact but Russia's GDP is the same

813
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,950
as Italy's they have the same resources

814
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:32,900
so they cannot do everything on their

815
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:37,359
own or North Korea actually it was on

816
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:44,780
the news recently that there was this

817
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:50,030
North korea-related virus so if you add

818
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:52,010
to that some territoriality problems you

819
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:55,130
have the whole thing you have no whole

820
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:58,700
package so conclusions so far we've been

821
00:44:55,130 --> 00:45:00,010
attacked nobody had noticed until the

822
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:04,669
alarm went off

823
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:07,310
we've been reactive that is until it

824
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,110
wasn't technically detected that there

825
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:12,470
was a problem in the computer systems

826
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:14,750
nobody said anything about it this means

827
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:17,000
we are being reactive instead of

828
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:20,480
proactive I can't remember now the name

829
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,630
of the attack to Google I think it was

830
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:29,200
2011 or 12 or they suffer wouldn't every

831
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:29,200
year but the attack actually detected

832
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:38,300
that one of Google's servers was over

833
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:41,120
interacting that is more than what the

834
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,980
usual metrics say and after the research

835
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,140
well they concluded that it was a

836
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:49,760
Chinese well at least these people have

837
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:55,310
more resources so that's what they

838
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,809
assumed but what is curious here is that

839
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:00,179
the

840
00:45:56,809 --> 00:46:02,429
attack took place because somebody knew

841
00:46:00,179 --> 00:46:03,689
what the company was about what the

842
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:06,809
purchasing department date would be

843
00:46:03,689 --> 00:46:08,788
programmers did etc and they were

844
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:09,660
reactive in this case so it happens to

845
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:12,809
them as well

846
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,969
what is the completion that well we've

847
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:16,349
been attacked we've had a virus for

848
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:18,719
several months and it's been doing

849
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:23,009
things since that inside our systems so

850
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:26,549
this is what we have now how does the

851
00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:29,789
intelligence team work at least in my

852
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:33,329
school this is what we do first of all

853
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:37,109
we need to have a team imagine we are

854
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:40,670
competing for a contract in Australia

855
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:46,189
this is something known by the

856
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:48,809
cybersecurity expert we have technicians

857
00:46:46,189 --> 00:46:51,719
intelligence analysts small we're

858
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:54,089
honored lists the guy who read this the

859
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:55,469
newspaper who's also very important this

860
00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:58,288
is something I recommend you have to

861
00:46:55,469 --> 00:47:00,299
read the paper every day because if you

862
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:02,670
read the paper every day you know that

863
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:03,900
you know what is going on in Australia

864
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:08,429
and you know that your company is going

865
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,929
to be competing there so another

866
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:13,109
important thing is that more where

867
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:15,239
analyst is not an intelligence analyst

868
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:18,839
and this is something I very strongly

869
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:21,380
defend and more where analyst is the one

870
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:25,019
who can tell you how the software works

871
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:33,959
they can tell you what relation the

872
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:35,368
software has with other software but

873
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:38,788
there are all the things that they

874
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:40,829
cannot do we also need to understand

875
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:44,789
what the emerging properties of the

876
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:47,429
companies are that is are we involved in

877
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:50,339
international operations have we

878
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:54,059
identified our potential attackers what

879
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:57,269
do we know about ourselves the physical

880
00:47:54,059 --> 00:48:01,589
classical security is dealt with but not

881
00:47:57,269 --> 00:48:03,959
this part in a nutshell the goal here is

882
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:06,509
to know where you are if you know

883
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:08,319
yourself and you know your enemy you

884
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:15,960
will be able to win

885
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:15,960
all battles if I know my company well

886
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:23,920
that is I have done a great job already

887
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:26,529
well then I have to design intelligence

888
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,830
scenarios I criticize a lot of

889
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:31,510
intelligence and sometimes you just need

890
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:35,620
to forget about the computer and take

891
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:38,830
your pen and your piece of paper it was

892
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:42,640
invented years ago but it still works so

893
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:45,630
I have to design several scenarios I

894
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,400
have to decide a peaceful scenario

895
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:51,640
scenario reflecting the beginning of the

896
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:55,570
attack the attack on course and others

897
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:58,660
these scenarios take place based on

898
00:48:55,570 --> 00:49:01,510
several conditions that is indicators

899
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:05,529
now going back to my example how do I

900
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:09,100
know that I'm going to get to this or

901
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:11,890
this other shop or store in order to buy

902
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:15,430
something well because I like the shop

903
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:17,770
it has a good reputation I like the

904
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:22,180
people who show up in that place those

905
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:24,759
are the indicators so the next scenario

906
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:27,910
is easy the alternative future is is it

907
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,310
either our buy or I don't buy but if I

908
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:33,310
decided to go to the shop it's because I

909
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:36,390
have several indicators in my mind which

910
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:41,380
are pointing me - yes loyalty no

911
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:47,350
intelligence has been turned into a

912
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:50,430
discipline like criminology that is a

913
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:53,470
procedure that can be replicated

914
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,779
probably sometimes you've met someone

915
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,100
and you've gone like mmm I don't like

916
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,230
this person there's something weird

917
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,569
about this person or about this company

918
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:04,180
well that thing you have in your mind

919
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:07,810
needs to be translated into indicators

920
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:11,319
into scenarios and list down why you

921
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:14,020
like or dislike somebody or something

922
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,870
then as an analyst there's something

923
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:20,350
that can happen to you if you support a

924
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:21,848
socketing for example you are always

925
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,430
going to be biased

926
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:27,489
the result of the match is going to be

927
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:30,489
biased to your perspective so the more

928
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:31,420
indicators I introduced to the scenario

929
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:35,199
the better

930
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:38,019
and those indicators may be either cyber

931
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,660
that is technically obtained but I can

932
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:46,749
also have all the sources of information

933
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:50,910
that is intelligence has to go beyond it

934
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:50,910
is too easy to say it was bird inhibited

935
00:50:50,969 --> 00:50:57,640
therefore we need to use analytic

936
00:50:53,559 --> 00:51:01,089
techniques the classical analyst uses a

937
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:04,180
lot of analytic techniques these

938
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:12,940
techniques were introduced in Spain by

939
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:25,149
the National Intelligence Center try to

940
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:28,119
implement the so-called these techniques

941
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:30,459
include for example Gans diagrams for

942
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:35,039
example if I go to the drug store it is

943
00:51:30,459 --> 00:51:40,209
because I have a need I have gotten

944
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:43,599
money I have money in my purse and then

945
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:46,719
I go and buy so here we have the three

946
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,400
scenarios in order to move forward to

947
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,729
the next scenario the first scenario

948
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,940
needs to be completed that is if I go to

949
00:51:51,729 --> 00:51:57,399
the drug store it is because I have a

950
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:59,410
need and if I go to the drug store I

951
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,569
need to have money so if I don't have

952
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:03,640
money I don't go to the drug store so

953
00:52:01,569 --> 00:52:06,670
this is the flow we have to understand

954
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:10,348
here is where the responses are that's

955
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:15,519
why the cyber part of it isn't the

956
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:20,489
critical one here I wanted to insist on

957
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:22,779
the indicated design because it creates

958
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:25,690
an awareness-raising

959
00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:27,999
in the analyst thanks to those

960
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:29,010
indicators our will be able to know

961
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:33,350
where I am

962
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:36,420
and maybe my decisions are less biased

963
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:39,120
some analysts say that they believe in

964
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:42,090
their instincts that's okay but this is

965
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:45,960
more important because your instinct

966
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:49,700
isn't or shouldn't be always right so

967
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:53,550
the indicators are a long list of

968
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:57,419
assumptions of hints and all of them

969
00:52:53,550 --> 00:53:04,170
combined give you a global vision that

970
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:06,150
is this seems very logical actually

971
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:13,230
Sherman Kent the guy we mentioned before

972
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:17,700
was a historian so maybe his background

973
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:20,850
helped him structure here's three so it

974
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:25,830
is unavoidable to have that list of

975
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:28,500
indicators so in a nutshell we are

976
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:31,200
coming to an end we need to understand

977
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:35,420
the tactics techniques and procedures of

978
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:38,160
our attackers that is the ABC of

979
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:41,670
intelligence if I understand the tactics

980
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:44,970
the techniques and the procedures I will

981
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:48,360
be able to generate alerts before the

982
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:50,839
problem comes to me that is if I know

983
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:57,120
somebody is interacting with my

984
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:59,130
employees if I know somebody is doing

985
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,410
something and I am able to characterize

986
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:04,710
that because of the previous

987
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:06,870
intelligence I've had because in a

988
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,390
company there is basic intelligence and

989
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:13,220
there's previous intelligence so if I am

990
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:16,230
able to design these strategies and the

991
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:19,049
procedures for each enemy that I have

992
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:24,420
identified I can predict my enemy's

993
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:28,320
movements so this is know and for this

994
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:31,110
it's very important to use your pen your

995
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:33,819
paper to keep updated with international

996
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:36,130
politics with the

997
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:39,190
company's policies and many more things

998
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:41,799
if we are at this point we will know

999
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:46,209
what we need to keep an eye on in order

1000
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:48,969
to predict our next scenario then we can

1001
00:54:46,209 --> 00:54:53,259
model or shape a thread and create alert

1002
00:54:48,969 --> 00:54:57,239
States and finally the collection that

1003
00:54:53,259 --> 00:55:01,209
we get from the cyber intelligent is

1004
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:05,880
means it's not the goal and this is what

1005
00:55:01,209 --> 00:55:05,879
I want to stress in this presentation

1006
00:55:06,299 --> 00:55:13,170
conclusions intelligence is indeed

1007
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:17,109
important to our organization

1008
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:19,660
intelligence is always strategic and it

1009
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:22,449
must always be proactive that is it has

1010
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:24,969
to tell me what is going to happen not

1011
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:29,339
who's going to win the election they

1012
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:32,199
have to give me mated results Sabre

1013
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:34,779
intelligence understood as just the

1014
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:39,279
management of technical information is

1015
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:46,499
useless and it is reactive something

1016
00:55:39,279 --> 00:55:50,079
that may not be pleasant to hear by some

1017
00:55:46,499 --> 00:55:52,808
analysts is that an analyst isn't a

1018
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:58,299
professional trained and intelligence

1019
00:55:52,809 --> 00:56:04,809
for example general practitioners and

1020
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:07,869
medicine they may not be the ones who

1021
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:09,670
find the vaccine against eighths they

1022
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:12,759
are both physicians but they don't do

1023
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:15,849
the same thing so I hope I've given you

1024
00:56:12,759 --> 00:56:19,180
a broad idea of what cyber intelligence

1025
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:22,300
is and please don't hesitate to ask any

1026
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:29,109
questions you may have thank you

1027
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:32,020
a bit annoying at least not all at the

1028
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:34,570
same time then if there are no questions

1029
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:36,970
thank you very much and enjoy something

1030
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:40,800
there it is a wonderful city

1031
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,799
