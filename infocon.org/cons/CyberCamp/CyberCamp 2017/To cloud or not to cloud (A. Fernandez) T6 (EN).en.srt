1
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:25,869
good morning my name is out Daniel

2
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:31,570
foundation I'm in charge for sales I'm

3
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:35,379
Claudia I'm in infrastructure skocy

4
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:39,900
and I'm also in charge of SIL PDS and

5
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:43,769
cloud issues when we were thinking about

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,780
this talk because it's gonna be Rover

7
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:48,400
workshop in a talk we had to take into

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,430
consideration a series of circumstances

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,080
which I think are important which is we

10
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,059
had to understand what we mean by a

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,220
cloud I'll give you an example when

12
00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:04,989
cloudy said to me what's a cloud for you

13
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:08,110
I gave a series of definitions when he

14
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:11,140
explained to me that actually cloud is a

15
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:13,960
business model from which we're going to

16
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:16,090
build a series of solutions then it

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,949
would seem as simple as you'd seen it in

18
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,789
the beginning but let's just have a look

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:26,710
now when we talk about cloud what do we

20
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:29,200
mean cloud is an evolution of a

21
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,509
traditional business which is basically

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,820
a network of computers and it's a

23
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:38,649
business that's based on sharing

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:40,689
resources quite literally some like

25
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:42,670
sales directly talk about it as a

26
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:46,089
private network but actually it's not so

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:49,630
it could be the cloud is a business

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,240
model which is still being development

29
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:56,609
and in developed and just growing very

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,589
quickly and we shouldn't forget all the

31
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,809
concerns relating to security and our

32
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,060
business it has we've got an example

33
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,270
here these two important people who were

34
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,000
a bit outdated now who thought that the

35
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,950
market had finished almost a hundred

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,080
years ago and yet as things stand today

37
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,170
we haven't even reached half the

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,400
potential that this world can reached

39
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,739
the world is increasingly interconnected

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,960
there are more and more devices every

41
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,040
day that's connected to the same

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,720
supplies and we don't even know where

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,340
they are what are we going to talk about

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,310
to

45
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,099
we're going to talk about IT traditional

46
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,530
IT cloud computing and security audits

47
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,319
and hardening in cloud systems we all

48
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:44,819
know what traditional IT is which is

49
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:48,690
basically what any company or a person

50
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:50,849
has for example at my house I've got all

51
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,400
different pieces of devices and

52
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,649
depending on the kind of infrastructure

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,140
that I need I can invest more or less of

54
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:02,880
course these kind of equipment sometimes

55
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,470
aren't enough where we have more

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,540
requirements and that's when cloud

57
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,540
computing comes into play and what cloud

58
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:14,400
computing does for you is according to

59
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:17,609
your service needs you can actually add

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,099
space instead of investing in a new a

61
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,769
piece of hardware and these kinds of

62
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,510
solutions also lead to a series of

63
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:28,049
problems which is what we're going to

64
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:31,200
try to talk to you about in today's talk

65
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,750
let's first look at what we can expect

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,420
when we work with cloud systems how we

67
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,760
can implement them correctly and how

68
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:46,700
should we start investing in cloud

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:49,319
computing or not as things stand today

70
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,390
basically everything is connected from

71
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,530
our desktops our servers on mobile

72
00:03:51,390 --> 00:04:02,250
devices even have networks that are

73
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:03,720
directly deployed in cloud we've got for

74
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,540
example we could have our whole business

75
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,760
network on a cloud we also have

76
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,769
databases and other services that are in

77
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,679
a more industrial level when we talk

78
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,048
about cloud computing let's concentrate

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,660
today more on the difference between

80
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:21,539
traditional IT and cloud computing in

81
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,360
traditional IT what you do is like

82
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:26,070
having a meeting you say which equipment

83
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,750
you want who you're gonna buy it from

84
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,500
how you're gonna buy it and who's gonna

85
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,169
fund it what cloud does is it allows you

86
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,320
to change this a business model and you

87
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:40,229
end up contracting all the services that

88
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:45,060
you in the past used to plan

89
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:46,800
with a lot of investment in time and bit

90
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,850
delayed as if it was like a mobile

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,150
telephone service and we pay per use

92
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:56,430
rather than paying for maintaining

93
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,590
Hardware etcetera one of the things that

94
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,750
you need to take into account to into a

95
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,659
traditional IT is that you're gonna need

96
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,430
more far more staff for your needs a

97
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:12,180
systems administrator operators and

98
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:15,210
places to have this installed these

99
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,450
things these devices installed and at

100
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:21,570
the same time we need to remember that

101
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,940
they can be used by just one client well

102
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,610
when you talk about cloud computing

103
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,410
these problems disappear to a point you

104
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,760
are going to need a specialist of course

105
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:35,970
you're always going to need specialists

106
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:39,330
but if I wanted more processing ability

107
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,400
in the past I had to buy more pieces of

108
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,669
equipment I don't do that anymore I just

109
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,630
say to the supplier can you extend my

110
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:51,650
and so I can take less time the cost

111
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:55,500
will be lower and if everything is

112
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:57,900
alright and now Nets a multi-tenant it's

113
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,890
going to be accessible anywhere and of

114
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,020
course that's always it's something

115
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:07,919
that's important cloud computing can be

116
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:10,830
defined as a model to make convenient

117
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,950
access easier for a people that demand a

118
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,680
set of computational sources cloud

119
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,210
computing according to its definition

120
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,190
has to meet this definition is up on the

121
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:25,020
screen now

122
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:28,950
maybe the hotmail was the first to meet

123
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,270
this definition the idea of a cloud is

124
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,880
that you've got direct collected

125
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:37,200
connection to the supply you can sign

126
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,700
off you can make it bigger without even

127
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,550
having to send an email to your supplier

128
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,099
having said that nobody knows the

129
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,610
hotmail telephone number it's no longer

130
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,100
a traditional supplier what they do is

131
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,020
they offer you a platform a server where

132
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,040
you connect you carry out what you want

133
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,880
to do and then you carry on with your

134
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,640
daily

135
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,070
what's interesting about this and I

136
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,580
don't know that males telephone number

137
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,320
but what they're doing is imposing us

138
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:09,000
series of conditions that you have to

139
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,920
accept and take on board and if you've

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,100
got a problem there's only usually one

141
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:17,010
channel for solving the problems which

142
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,870
is usually the solution that always

143
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,670
works with us and depend on anybody and

144
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:25,110
that makes it more accessible as well

145
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:29,280
let's look at the clout model that

146
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:32,580
promotes availability when I went to

147
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,349
hotmail for the first time what I was

148
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,890
surprised is that you could connect from

149
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,820
virtually anywhere I said from virtually

150
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,990
anywhere because there's always

151
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:45,469
exceptions this discovery is something

152
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:49,250
that you can't do with traditional IT

153
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:52,020
there are five basic characteristics and

154
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,890
three service models and for deployment

155
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:59,909
we're also going to look at them now

156
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:04,349
self-service on demand this is easy to

157
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:08,070
understand the more I need I just take

158
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:10,170
more more space if I lack storage space

159
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,650
so I just ask for more space and I'll

160
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:16,800
have to pay for it my free email service

161
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,210
gives some has it some limitations

162
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,480
attacked it attached to it but I want

163
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:25,500
more that sort of thing we need to

164
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,960
consider elasticity as well the cloud

165
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,390
theory is that it's infinite we can ask

166
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,909
as many resources as we want we can link

167
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:36,120
up to different cloud types or different

168
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:43,319
suppliers or we have community clouds

169
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:45,630
and so one of the advantages is that

170
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,250
it's easy to access from the network and

171
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,290
it's a measured service and it's a

172
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,790
measure service we can know how much

173
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:56,010
we're using RAM disk space bandwidth

174
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,480
everything that you can want to know and

175
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,900
some things that you probably don't want

176
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,290
to know

177
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,420
all of these platforms give you infinite

178
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,270
to transporting systems that allow you

179
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,660
to measure and contract basically what

180
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,660
you need

181
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,340
and what's more the Great's of cloud

182
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:22,590
advantage is that it's easy to access

183
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:26,580
from anywhere so the paradigm shift here

184
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:30,420
is enormous because in the past we got a

185
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:33,390
server and we opened ports and accesses

186
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,150
according to our needs and now it's a

187
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:40,890
service that's offered and we close

188
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:43,470
ports as problems arrive when you use

189
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,350
these kind of services norm normally

190
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,040
everything is open and then you close

191
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:52,410
afterwards as you don't need it you just

192
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,209
close things behind you this is a good

193
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,579
practice for the simple reason that it

194
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,950
forces me to check each one of the steps

195
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,750
that I have to do to try to solve for

196
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:06,300
things because otherwise you get a bit

197
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:10,890
lazy about doing things and you can

198
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:14,880
leave things open one important thing is

199
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:18,240
of this mate Amisha cell service is that

200
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:23,160
you can contract according to a minute

201
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:29,700
and the terms have used change every

202
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:33,439
minute every time you accept a service

203
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,150
agreement and this we see quite a

204
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,400
frequently with SAS services such as

205
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,430
Google Maps and Google activities where

206
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,920
you sign up and you've accepted things

207
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:48,599
by default this is quite a common

208
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,219
practice in any of you hmm you see any

209
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,960
sort of service you have Facebook if you

210
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,470
put it on a cloud you put it at moment

211
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,550
they talk about new conditions you need

212
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:02,390
to look at and review all the different

213
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,390
privacy options

214
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:19,029
okay the resource sets these rusul suits

215
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:21,459
always there to serve several uses at

216
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:24,220
the same time even if it's a corporate

217
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:26,880
cloud it's the same because it's a

218
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,800
multi-tenant with several physical

219
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,130
resources and virtual resources that are

220
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,290
allocated and relocated according to the

221
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,360
requirements of the consumer so multi

222
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,410
tenants are for internal consumers not

223
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:48,279
external ones let's look at software as

224
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:51,069
a service now let's look first at SaaS

225
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,120
software service which is obviously one

226
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,779
of the typical things that we'll be

227
00:11:52,120 --> 00:12:02,560
using one of these key is hotmail or

228
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:05,019
Gmail thing is with this is that we're

229
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,369
going to have a very flexible solution

230
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:13,410
but that means that we don't have any

231
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:17,380
control over it does anybody here have

232
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:21,310
some a control over the logs that you

233
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:24,310
have hotmail yahoo and google mail can

234
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:28,810
generate no that's outside of control of

235
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:30,219
course the solution is in the hands of

236
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,199
the person that serves us but as a

237
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,680
customer we don't have that control

238
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,029
especially in software as a Service SaaS

239
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,519
we have to remember that the person in

240
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:42,070
charge of the platform is always the

241
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,800
supplier we're just responsible for

242
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,839
access it's very important from a legal

243
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:51,910
viewpoint in a forensic viewpoint we

244
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:53,649
need to know that we can't get much out

245
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,890
of a supplier if there's been a security

246
00:12:53,649 --> 00:13:02,220
problem you won't find out what's

247
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:06,490
happening until the supplier actually

248
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,699
tells you what's interesting about this

249
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,730
as claudia said is that however much we

250
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,930
ask from the supplier only on very

251
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,220
infrequently they're going to tell us

252
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,219
what we want to know

253
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:25,199
they always say oh no we can't tell you

254
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:28,239
about this because of confidentially

255
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:29,979
confidentially issues they won't give

256
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,120
you anything even if you take into court

257
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,620
if you get a bit arrogant though they

258
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,620
won't they won't to reply

259
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,410
platform-as-a-service if there's a

260
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,739
developer in the room this will be your

261
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,379
starting point for all the daily work

262
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,160
that you do when you create a new

263
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:56,889
service or platform they're different

264
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:59,560
between pas and SaaS is that the system

265
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,420
looks a bit more profound and in the

266
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,410
platform you can see how many resources

267
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:10,000
you using normally platform as a service

268
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:12,310
is used by development teams to create

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,160
platforms such as Flay's Facebook Gmail

270
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:18,069
and cetera before putting them into

271
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:23,490
production you do all the tests that you

272
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:28,449
need and see what capacities you need to

273
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:30,430
contract with a new supplier the great

274
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:33,279
advantage of this is that a developer is

275
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,560
going to contract for a limited amount

276
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,970
of time the resources until they develop

277
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:44,258
their app this means that there today

278
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:46,000
are as many platforms as apps and apps

279
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:50,649
that we've sort of lost sight of them

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:53,529
because the fact that many platform past

281
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:56,439
platforms are free such as Google

282
00:14:53,529 --> 00:15:02,730
developer and this is to encourage

283
00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:06,219
people to use them use some service and

284
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:07,930
then we need to really look at the

285
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,430
service conditions this is very

286
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,739
important when you look at the platform

287
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,920
they're going to work in otherwise you

288
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,559
can get some very unpleasant or pleasant

289
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,000
surprises so you need to read the terms

290
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:25,600
and conditions before you get involved

291
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:31,270
and the thing that I like

292
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:35,050
and that perhaps we use most is IaaS

293
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:38,740
infrastructure as a service here we can

294
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:44,140
contract services such as RAM CPUs

295
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:47,740
virtual CPUs normally is a virtual

296
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,720
machines virtual computers they're an

297
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,490
infinite number of other services but

298
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,950
actually really they're just

299
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:57,220
infrastructure of course has to be

300
00:15:53,950 --> 00:16:03,040
shared infrastructure it's not you can't

301
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:04,750
just have a dedicated server and here I

302
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,490
can see something that I've been struck

303
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:10,180
by you said that they have to be shared

304
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:14,230
what does that mean well it means that

305
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:17,319
in the same disk world together you can

306
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:21,910
have the same CPU or the whole the same

307
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,730
Ram set or or network sources so that

308
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:27,459
means that I have to share my resources

309
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:34,870
with somebody who I don't know what if

310
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:35,770
my machines are share with somebody who

311
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,160
I don't know then what happens if

312
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:41,770
there's an incident how do I get a an

313
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,380
image of my memory or the disk the

314
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:48,270
cornerstone of cloud computing is

315
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:53,490
virtualization virtualization allows us

316
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:57,010
to do what are called normally snapshots

317
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:59,160
it's an exact copy of the machines

318
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,600
estate at that time which in many

319
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,969
platforms you can include a snapshot of

320
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,599
the RAM you can see what you've got in

321
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:11,040
your RAM in a snapshot but what about

322
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,208
other people accessing my snapshot well

323
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,740
it depends what you have to do the

324
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,500
routes that you follow to get the

325
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:20,859
snapshot are gonna write this down I'm

326
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,660
just interested in seeing how accessible

327
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:25,479
a snapshot is at a given moment in time

328
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,970
so it would be looking at a smach

329
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,490
snapshot a virtual machine you may find

330
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:32,400
you've got other problems you may have a

331
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,480
very young cloud

332
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,790
supplier provider have got resources

333
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,690
that are limited but some because they

334
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:46,230
don't know because of malpractice they

335
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:50,070
directly just have one Network channel

336
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:52,350
to manage to store Internet so for

337
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,480
example if I've got access to this only

338
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,550
channel this single channel then

339
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,830
everybody can access mine everybody

340
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:01,310
else's well yes you can see all their

341
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:04,500
hard disks if everybody else

342
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:11,669
this isn't normally done for example

343
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:13,650
maybe I want to get into their area if

344
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:20,060
you don't have a credentials you can't

345
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:25,020
access people people's machines you can

346
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:29,129
go and look at their Drive but it might

347
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:33,180
be worse if there's a management change

348
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:35,250
you can see the access this is never

349
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,850
done well they shouldn't do this

350
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,490
ok I'm a bit more relaxed now let's now

351
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:44,219
look at the different cloud types that

352
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:47,790
are out there just to understand what

353
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,280
we're talking about we need to expend a

354
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:55,020
bit about how these clouds work what's a

355
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:57,330
private cloud and I know that this means

356
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,870
it's a private cloud for me that I use

357
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:03,210
with my people I can it can be used for

358
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,939
example by a company that has their own

359
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:10,440
cloud and in these kind of private

360
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:12,990
clouds it may well be that you're inside

361
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,170
the company and administrators outside

362
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:18,540
or vice versa and all different

363
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,670
possibilities and permutations yes yes

364
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:24,690
that's right

365
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:27,120
these clouds private clouds could even

366
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,700
be off premises in a country we don't

367
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,139
ever know where they are

368
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:35,580
I'm saying this because the fact this is

369
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:38,280
interesting the fact that you use cloud

370
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,919
computing services sometimes to you we

371
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,350
forget to ask where they are and these

372
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:47,100
kinds of things you need to remember

373
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:51,310
that if you store them sensitive date

374
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:55,510
outside Spain these need to meet a

375
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:58,720
series of requirements for example they

376
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:02,950
need to buy it by the Data Protection

377
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:07,690
Act and a whole series of other laws

378
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:11,710
which either I read quite carefully and

379
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:14,290
make sure that they are abided by or I

380
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,080
don't store my data there let's just

381
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:24,879
assume that I've got a cloud in Thailand

382
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:26,590
I bet they don't abide by the law I mean

383
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,180
I wouldn't store my diet data there so

384
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:31,209
this is something that we need to be

385
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:36,760
very careful with a problem is that if I

386
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:39,010
ask somebody who's storing my data

387
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,330
off-site and I set them are you meeting

388
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,070
the legislation to abide by the

389
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,530
legislation this all yes yes yes I abide

390
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,929
by all the legislation but you need to

391
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,980
be consistent when you do these sort of

392
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,930
things because the people that are

393
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:53,200
really in charge of all this is us the

394
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:56,290
buck stops with us not the provider they

395
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,920
have their own rules and another kind of

396
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:03,580
cloud is the community cloud a community

397
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:11,050
cloud it's like a set of clouds for

398
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:17,889
example Yahoo Hotmail and Bing for

399
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:22,330
example to share searches so they've

400
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:25,360
created a community cloud to do certain

401
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:28,899
kinds of searches yes they're currently

402
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,250
developing clouds between different

403
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:36,640
corporations for example if you don't

404
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:40,780
trust the way you access your personal

405
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:45,100
data you have to actually have this

406
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:48,310
shared clouds and the one that we all

407
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,590
use every day which is in Amazon or any

408
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:53,770
other sort of normal cloud is the public

409
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,020
cloud the pub the infrastructure side of

410
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,600
the public

411
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,790
public cloud whether it be SAS or pass

412
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,129
is available for the general public for

413
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:05,090
industry in general

414
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:07,410
some countries limited such as China but

415
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,240
outside that everybody can access it

416
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,790
from wherever they happen to be and we

417
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,710
can all contract it whenever we're

418
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:18,080
interested in these are the kinds of

419
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:22,080
clouds that we use when we use Dropbox

420
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,720
for example any sort of service so as to

421
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,780
be able to access this service so it's

422
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,360
open to everybody even with a mobile

423
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,760
phone you're continually using this

424
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:36,659
cloud without even realizing it just

425
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,309
because of the data that's Google or

426
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,980
Apple stores in the cloud and this is

427
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:43,139
interesting because although we and

428
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:49,230
we're going back to the same conditions

429
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:51,150
nobody can guarantee that where I where

430
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,440
I stealthy store these data I'd like to

431
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:57,390
say something about this which is quite

432
00:22:52,440 --> 00:23:01,950
interesting normally these kinds of data

433
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:04,440
are encrypted but it wasn't so long ago

434
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:09,000
when there was a security problem with

435
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:11,670
Dropbox where users had actually rubbed

436
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,640
out these files and they suddenly popped

437
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:18,050
up again just sort of like magically so

438
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:23,429
how do I know that those data that I've

439
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:26,580
wiped out aren't gonna pop up again it's

440
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:29,370
not just a matter of doing away with all

441
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:32,340
the data but the the visible data but

442
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:38,840
there's all these system snapshots and

443
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:43,580
we can't trust that they'll disappear

444
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:48,720
these large companies such as Dropbox

445
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:50,600
don't door the typical shared files that

446
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:56,460
we have but different

447
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:58,469
JPG files in a numbered file and they

448
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,929
keep all of this in database that they

449
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,950
store if they've got a problem what

450
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:04,600
they're going to restore is that

451
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:08,950
database but

452
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,929
you remove a file you don't remove the

453
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:14,050
file per se but you remove the entry

454
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:18,370
into the database every so often they do

455
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:23,080
purge and get rid of it but if you've

456
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:25,090
had a problem of even if I knew

457
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,310
somebody's rubbed it out you can go back

458
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:32,260
to the database and get all the archives

459
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:34,560
that are available this makes me ask

460
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:37,620
myself a whole series of things you know

461
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:42,610
are you trying to say to me that it's

462
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,929
impossible for them to see the content

463
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,300
of what they've got no they can see it

464
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:48,670
of course they can if I say to them what

465
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,290
I want to see the content of all these

466
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,220
archives where they give it to me no

467
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,990
they won't

468
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,170
why if it's mine because it's actually

469
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:59,680
not yours I don't understand

470
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,990
what do you mean it's not mine normally

471
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,110
it's yours yes but you have to prove

472
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:07,930
that they've got it yeah but if I've

473
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:12,010
uploaded it to the cloud how do you know

474
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:13,300
that you've they've got it this is one

475
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:17,110
of the things that we're never gonna

476
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,180
know I can be very sure about one what's

477
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:23,790
out there and this leads us on to

478
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,790
something even worse which is data loss

479
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,490
you probably signed the terms and

480
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,659
conditions and and it's out now I know

481
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:36,700
it sounds like I'm being paranoid but

482
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:42,610
this could happen another cloud is

483
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:45,670
governmental cloud you can actually if

484
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:52,270
you go to an AWS you can actually try to

485
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:54,940
get this it's like a data center in the

486
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,129
US there was another one in China but a

487
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,230
couple days ago the Chinese government

488
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:02,310
brought it down and she would seem

489
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:02,310
somebody brought it bought it

490
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:14,620
we don't know how they've how it's been

491
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:18,129
paid for but these are other matters in

492
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:22,379
the government cloud which a couple of

493
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:25,150
CPD's now in the u.s. only certain

494
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:29,980
organizations can contract AWS services

495
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:32,650
I would try to get into one of those

496
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,630
places of course I would when we talk

497
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:38,010
about governmental clouds we're talking

498
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:40,620
about the fact that they'll be far more

499
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:43,510
strict with their controls than others

500
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:46,029
and I was gonna say something stupid I

501
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,520
was gonna say they'll never let the

502
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:50,980
clouds without the security but if you

503
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,830
realize that they've just found some

504
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:57,640
several gigavolt our secrets information

505
00:26:53,830 --> 00:27:00,399
I'm not so sure about that I don't I

506
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:04,390
know there's been a CIA leak recently of

507
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:09,449
several tools but anyway these kinds of

508
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:13,570
governmental clouds have also changed

509
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:16,659
the paradigm in way in the way in which

510
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:22,658
governments control and contract these

511
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:25,659
services there's another kind of cloud

512
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:31,779
as well which is the hybrid cloud which

513
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:34,559
is the one I really like and there's a

514
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:38,200
lot of cloud called a secrets cloud in

515
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:41,039
intelligence services Amazon also offers

516
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:46,779
a service called the secret clouds I

517
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:50,020
think you can see it in some of the

518
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:51,520
Amazon pages they refer to this cloud

519
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,520
but there's no official documents about

520
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,960
it so actually it doesn't actually

521
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,658
officially exist we just think think it

522
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,210
and exists let's have a look now the

523
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:03,820
hybrid cloud which is a mix of course of

524
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:08,860
public and private house it's usually

525
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:10,450
used for privately until it's been

526
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,539
tested and then it becomes public that's

527
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:17,130
what a hybrid cloud is another classic

528
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:17,129
case of hybrid clouds I

529
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:27,190
blocks for example of the stock exchange

530
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:30,399
where during the day they have their

531
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:33,960
website and they have certain custom

532
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,580
information and at night they just

533
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,960
upload a whole series of operations so

534
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,120
they can be calculated the ones that

535
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,970
have been carried out during the day can

536
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,678
also be used if we've got a dedicated

537
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:48,519
server it doesn't have to be in our

538
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:53,080
offices suppose we're a newspaper such

539
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:57,340
as the both the Galicia newspaper and it

540
00:28:53,080 --> 00:29:00,519
may happen that we've published an

541
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:03,610
article but our infrastructure doesn't

542
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:06,340
allow us to send that information to all

543
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:10,330
our readers so what we do is with a

544
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:12,939
certain password we can spread this load

545
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:16,090
of this news so that everybody can get

546
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:19,029
it everybody can access it of the

547
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:23,320
previous definitions that we've spoken

548
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:26,649
about you've now got an idea of what at

549
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,019
NIST document is but let's now look more

550
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:32,439
closely at the cloud platforms that are

551
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:34,470
available in cloud platforms and

552
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,019
virtualization we'll have many more than

553
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:40,330
those that you see here maybe these are

554
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:43,600
the most representative platforms each

555
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:49,769
with its own features we can speak about

556
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:53,830
VMware the most popular Microsoft Azure

557
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:56,559
that is becoming more popular amongst

558
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:59,320
custo customers Amazon it's a platform

559
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,010
that we all know and use for many

560
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,908
reasons

561
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:07,090
Red Hat with its own cloud and

562
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:10,840
virtualization platforms especially open

563
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:16,120
Stax / Red Hat its most usable

564
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:18,580
infrastructure and the last the newcomer

565
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:24,610
is docker it's an evolution of the

566
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:27,730
classic cages we have Citrix XenServer

567
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,270
for desktop virtualization and the

568
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,559
Oracle cloud

569
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:36,770
as for virtualization technologies it's

570
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,360
it's useful to know the details all all

571
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:42,908
of them have specific capacities

572
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:46,908
capabilities that are different VMware

573
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:51,950
is not the only one but it was the only

574
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:53,570
one to have high variability so machines

575
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:57,320
could transmit transferred to another

576
00:30:53,570 --> 00:31:02,629
machine Inc and the wizard zero failure

577
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:04,789
tolerance without even losing a pin so

578
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:07,630
that's important especially for critical

579
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:12,129
environments it's used in Bank

580
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:14,720
environments because of fraud all

581
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:18,919
communications are controlled and stable

582
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,919
lost pin is the catastrophe in that in

583
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:25,850
Bank services and some of these

584
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:30,950
technologies are free some of those are

585
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:36,980
not and others for various reasons we

586
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:39,679
are forced to use some of these

587
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:42,049
platforms have entered in a specific way

588
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,450
Oracle when we take a database if we

589
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:47,899
mount mounted on VMware and this machine

590
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:50,390
is moving in such moving or that we have

591
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:54,408
to pay two licenses for that database

592
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:56,720
but if we it is virtualized with the

593
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:59,870
Oracle system even it will change

594
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,600
country we only pay one license these

595
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,820
are details that are interesting to know

596
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,740
especially when you're big working big

597
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:12,529
companies what I really like in cloud

598
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:17,529
computing is democracy is IP

599
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:22,340
democratization an IT democratization

600
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:24,679
anybody can have access to a set of

601
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:28,149
resources and to new technologies that

602
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:33,649
only big companies could use in the past

603
00:32:28,149 --> 00:32:36,969
anybody today can have his or her small

604
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:42,110
parcel of database or all advanced

605
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:42,890
applications let's see how a capacity

606
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,929
versus them

607
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:49,790
man works this graph is simple in indeed

608
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:52,310
how I'm going to proceed according to

609
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:54,770
the traditional infrastructures or if

610
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:56,330
they use cloud infrastructure what's the

611
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,120
difference when I use a traditional

612
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,280
infrastructure for each growth knee they

613
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,600
have to invest more this type of

614
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,320
investment it's good for me if the needs

615
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,020
are always the same

616
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,179
what happens if needs evolve I have to

617
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,420
invest much more in more machines and

618
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:17,500
more equipment more technicians and more

619
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:20,270
specialists what happens if needs

620
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,420
decrease I have to maintain my machines

621
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:26,540
I can't really just serve them well

622
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,840
technicians well unfortunately they

623
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:32,000
disappear and when I use a cloud

624
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,429
technology if I need more

625
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,710
infrastructures I say put give me more

626
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:40,940
and that's it if at least I need less

627
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:43,670
but made it less and that's okay so

628
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:48,080
little by little this is changing

629
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:51,230
especially at world level we say in fact

630
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,889
within Google search simple one instead

631
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,840
of using Gartner indexes with a simple

632
00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:01,040
Google search if we look for cloud

633
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,860
server we obtain more than 210 million

634
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:13,520
references in Google if we look for

635
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:16,989
dedicated server the term in English in

636
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:25,759
English in Spanish results a little bit

637
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:26,928
worse it's service altogether in the

638
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,940
latin market

639
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:39,710
nobody says serve either cloud well the

640
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:42,380
cloud has come later to spain and we

641
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:48,080
know more about trapeze come coming from

642
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:51,230
providers the biggest concern of the

643
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:53,900
clouds over enemy is over call the comet

644
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:56,270
is selling more resources than the

645
00:34:53,900 --> 00:35:00,290
you have available we won't mention the

646
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:04,940
names during a course that we had with

647
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:10,220
cloud providers said that always commit

648
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:12,950
from 10:00 to 1:00 Garden DCP okay we

649
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:16,870
have a lot to offer at all but this was

650
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:19,899
a provider for IP voice and we said

651
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:23,720
[Music]

652
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:26,450
sometimes the customers complain ten to

653
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,520
one in voice IP is a little too much

654
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:31,460
let's go back to the cloud service

655
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:34,880
especially the part I prefer the

656
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:37,370
services that are not free what is the

657
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,670
cost of a cloud service depends my

658
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:44,650
hotmail my gmail my facebook of town my

659
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:50,420
Twitter account my Instagram camera

660
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:57,020
domain account not that one we don't pay

661
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:57,830
we don't pay in money people say is free

662
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,890
of charge

663
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:04,130
well you are the product of course so

664
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:09,020
what we do in privacy has it of course

665
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:12,200
people are is not aware of I have

666
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,880
nothing to hide and I say to them you

667
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,529
don't have anything to hide but when you

668
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,440
go to the toilet you close the door

669
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:18,980
that's something to hide in it's that

670
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,340
simple

671
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,270
we are able to sacrifice a lot part of

672
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,340
our lives

673
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:31,460
because we don't give it a real value

674
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:32,720
but it has value Vantage of cloud

675
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,090
computing and this type of

676
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,580
infrastructures is the orchestration

677
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:44,530
these are panels where we can program

678
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:47,690
all the needs to the number of customers

679
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:50,210
and large in a very elastic way all the

680
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:53,780
resources all reduced so I say I only

681
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,370
have this to pay then I can go back to

682
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,860
the free program

683
00:36:55,370 --> 00:37:00,390
but I'm going to lose customers so I

684
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:04,060
prefer to pay

685
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:06,250
advantage of cloud computing a great

686
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:09,100
adaption level and comes because it

687
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:14,710
helps to save money we pay more at the

688
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:17,560
end of the day they more as the Geiger

689
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:20,200
price ice per round price per Geiger

690
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,170
Burris the price per CPU but we don't

691
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:27,669
pay for the physical infrastructure so

692
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:30,550
we in a better position because we

693
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:33,460
exchange them from somewhere budget to

694
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:36,580
operational budget and gives more value

695
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:39,760
to precisely that's the difference

696
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:42,670
biggest difference between cloud and

697
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,530
traditional systems the traditional

698
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,230
systems I have the equipment's if I need

699
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:53,980
more I have to invest a lot of money on

700
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:57,960
hardware but in cloud computing remotely

701
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,960
with more people so it's interesting

702
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:09,569
this allows us to play with mobile

703
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:12,279
telephone where we can add one more Kia

704
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:17,170
Forte that's the only thing we need to

705
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:19,150
do most important thing here though is

706
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:25,900
the 80/20 rule

707
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:29,410
turnaround expenditure in hardware the

708
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:31,120
investment to keep it up and do maintain

709
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:33,310
it and now we're spending more in

710
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,870
operation in the past we had an IT

711
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:43,529
person fixing the print fixing the

712
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:46,359
desktops and sometimes the invite to

713
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:47,980
repair others and machines in there in

714
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,670
the company now this personnel is

715
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:53,530
changed people are dealing with our data

716
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,210
security and these people are giving us

717
00:38:53,530 --> 00:39:00,430
more value but they're not repairing

718
00:38:55,210 --> 00:39:03,820
printers any Massimo's and instead of a

719
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:07,149
fixed investment in our infrastructure

720
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:09,130
we have a recurrent expenditure so once

721
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,990
we can't maintain it because it doesn't

722
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:15,020
work would you say to pay less

723
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,729
we decide to have less number of safe

724
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:20,740
men because the works doesn't work

725
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:20,740
because you they do not selling so then

726
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:34,700
machine a machine where you buy soda you

727
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,240
pay every time you need a bottle so what

728
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:40,100
time of infrastructures will being

729
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,109
included in some services to manage

730
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,860
their services there is one Netflix what

731
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,920
about Netflix

732
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:51,290
is this traditional what is this

733
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,110
traditional IT I don't can't imagine

734
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:58,550
what this company has Netflix more

735
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:59,330
particularly is the giant for the cloud

736
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,540
consumers

737
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:05,600
it's a giant company they have no

738
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:11,360
singles physical servers everything is

739
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:14,900
hired to third parties in the data

740
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,570
centers they send network equipment they

741
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:21,530
only install network equipment that once

742
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:23,960
their other customers go down or well

743
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:25,580
there's a part of the services that is

744
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,070
cancelled but they just deal with

745
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,900
functionality Netflix is the big

746
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:32,060
revolution in cloud computing not just

747
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,510
as a provider but as a consumer and it's

748
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:37,609
a provider for SAS especially so that we

749
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:40,820
can sell our products and services and

750
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:44,060
did they have revolutionized the

751
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,869
security market the bit hub there are

752
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:50,090
placate ifs to check all the Amazon

753
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:55,070
instances that's incredible and this is

754
00:40:50,090 --> 00:41:01,340
very good let's concentrate on what we

755
00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:05,980
have if I'm not wrong you said that in

756
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:10,220
this graph if I come from down to top

757
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,880
you have more and more visibility from

758
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:15,140
above

759
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,119
so if you are a consumer of IAS but for

760
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,049
structure you can see the layer in pass

761
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:24,680
and you can see what is the SAS platform

762
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:25,670
this software that end-users use so you

763
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,058
can see it from the

764
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:31,040
beneath is that true what it means that

765
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:34,790
if you have the past's platform

766
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,190
if the behind it there's a SAS they will

767
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:40,430
have access to my data no problem with

768
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:42,440
that no problem if you have the

769
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,690
infrastructures have the access to

770
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,680
anything on top of them is there a

771
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:53,740
limitation can we protect ourselves well

772
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:57,140
it depends of the technician isn't it a

773
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:59,899
privilege escalation brings you from a

774
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,379
SAS to a past platform but nobody does

775
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:06,710
that

776
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:11,000
no it shouldn't be done well I'll I take

777
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:13,339
note I'll see if it's true I'm suppose I

778
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,930
can take his snapshots or one of the

779
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:17,930
virtual machines that we have around us

780
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:24,910
I know I want to know if I can extract

781
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:28,759
something from that let's test it in SAS

782
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:31,520
what are these services well software as

783
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:35,960
a service have lots of services Facebook

784
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:39,380
Amazon Google anything that we use every

785
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:42,890
day and we're not able to leave it in

786
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:46,540
SAS we can even talk about whatsapp in

787
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:49,339
this platform as a service for

788
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:52,369
developers this is great just in the

789
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:55,759
room can you can you recognise anything

790
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:58,220
that is not canonical we have a

791
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,119
developer in the room thank you a great

792
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:07,490
advantage if we want to create our next

793
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:09,230
super allocation and if we don't we have

794
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,359
the necessary resources we have no

795
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,520
funding we have no investors and we know

796
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,619
that our application will work but we

797
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,240
need a lot of resources in a limited

798
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:19,970
time to test this functionality we'll

799
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:24,529
have no money for drives for RAM memory

800
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:26,649
or for a network for a DRS we can go

801
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:30,290
back to the words of our great fry and

802
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:33,500
we need to buy more resources shut up

803
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:35,690
and scale my app within those we have

804
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,600
the infrastructure as a service the

805
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:42,070
typical provider

806
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,230
who and where that's important in there

807
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:46,090
are changes in our legislation we want

808
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,310
to know in which country and which

809
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:50,640
region we want to operate that's

810
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:53,650
important this type of services

811
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,480
according to the type of data you have

812
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,600
to control it especially with the new

813
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:03,160
data protection regulations the

814
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:06,910
responsible person is though you a penal

815
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:09,069
level you are responsible you have to be

816
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:11,609
careful with us you can be the person

817
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:17,860
responsible for that very difference

818
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:20,830
between virtualization and this and

819
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:23,650
that's in cloud computing not only there

820
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:25,779
is a hypervisors of calculation

821
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:30,400
computation the most technical part of

822
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:35,100
these data centers within a single

823
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:37,600
machine we can have an infinity of

824
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:41,080
operative systems and individual

825
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:46,110
machines you can have your operative

826
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:50,350
systems we mount a server we mount an

827
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:52,930
operating system and then now we have an

828
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:55,480
intermediate intermediate layer which is

829
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,390
hyper vision with all the operating

830
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,600
systems resources plus our other

831
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:04,060
applications we can create virtual

832
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:05,770
applications that would compound a set

833
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,830
of virtual machines serving a purpose

834
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:11,440
it's important to know this because in

835
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:14,710
the past we lost the control of an

836
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:18,160
application and we became a server here

837
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:20,740
we can lose the control of virtual

838
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:26,350
container and we lose all the services

839
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:30,870
behind one of the most important parts

840
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:34,330
of cloud infrastructures is storage

841
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:37,000
there's a full branch in data centers

842
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:41,190
they're specialists special specialists

843
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:44,950
in storage providing the necessary space

844
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:48,730
the brands that are we show here are the

845
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:50,129
most popular we not pay for that that's

846
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:52,710
a pity

847
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:55,579
types of storage well they're different

848
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:58,980
we need to know why we use these types

849
00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:02,039
the object storage everything is put

850
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:06,900
into a database and each object in

851
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:10,759
particular in another file in one owner

852
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:16,980
another hypervisor the most common is

853
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:21,119
blue server s SEF if you know it then we

854
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:25,019
have the storage by files we've always

855
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:28,170
used that and PS but we have another one

856
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:33,000
it's block storage will have a critical

857
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:35,609
application okay and it it needs a

858
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,730
dedicated resource we use a block for

859
00:46:35,609 --> 00:46:41,250
storage there are eight ten well you

860
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:44,009
would use a fourth of this rate ten for

861
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:46,890
us which sub will start to subdivide the

862
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:50,460
drives for a block for ourselves it's

863
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:53,700
just for applications that require a lot

864
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:57,150
of space in disks in database we can

865
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:59,788
have storages or in in devices in

866
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,829
different countries yes in blocks what

867
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:05,039
not they for the others so I can ask you

868
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:06,980
a response for you I don't have any

869
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,990
legal responsibility if I extract data

870
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,970
well it depends on your tools but the

871
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:17,149
provider will never collaborate with you

872
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:20,299
today we've tried to ask FTP logs from

873
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:26,430
hosting providers and it was impossible

874
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:28,049
we can't show you in the Gib Gib habit

875
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:30,930
that we're going to open next week for

876
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:35,480
these tools and this presentation will

877
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:40,200
be there we'll give you a censored email

878
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:42,930
with conversations with providers saying

879
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,848
what is the color of an orange that's a

880
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:49,190
question typical questions for first

881
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:52,529
supplier and the engine for steam

882
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:55,950
propelling so you asked for a log and

883
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:58,289
they just answer

884
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:00,149
do you want more services from us of

885
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:03,079
course you've seen that in all type of

886
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:06,200
services as Claudia said the

887
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:08,239
zero collaboration with providers and I

888
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,549
suppose it's their business because they

889
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:13,900
need to protect their intimacy and the

890
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:16,969
data integrity of their customers and

891
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:18,859
there's a multiple usage of that and

892
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:21,109
they're not going to allow me to access

893
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:24,140
a log that comes with many other things

894
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:26,989
at the same time so don't wait for that

895
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:29,569
for that data guarantee because you know

896
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:32,619
you're not going to have any reply the

897
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:36,589
great cloud revolution is brought by the

898
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:40,339
Sdn networks if you spoke about yacek

899
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:43,700
and crypto currency this is used for

900
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:46,640
crypto currency and for hash generation

901
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,700
with no network virtualization it works

902
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,390
fine these are microchips that are

903
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:55,368
designed for a specific purpose from

904
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:59,319
cryptocurrency they go back to network

905
00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:03,950
virtualization it's a fantastic

906
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:06,319
integration for a sec in operation

907
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:10,009
instead of having the core with 30

908
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:14,119
fibers we have a virtual instance with

909
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:18,289
DNS applicative and we needed a

910
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:20,690
specialized equipment now it's simple if

911
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:24,259
I need to make an investigation it's

912
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:26,900
easier to duplicate Labs then have them

913
00:49:24,259 --> 00:49:30,979
physically with me what's interesting in

914
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:35,869
the Sdn networks when we do an IP

915
00:49:30,979 --> 00:49:38,479
tracing we get to the data center we can

916
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:41,630
go there we know in which data center we

917
00:49:38,479 --> 00:49:45,459
are because we are traced routing and we

918
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:48,380
get to X number of suppliers we know

919
00:49:45,459 --> 00:49:51,739
that we got we've come through the X

920
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:55,609
node the X hub and we know it's in Spain

921
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:59,599
we know in Amazon US we know where we

922
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:04,880
are in this type of networks you have

923
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:07,130
the bidding where traffic is exchanging

924
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,660
in a transparent way between supplies

925
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,599
but in fact the package is not here it's

926
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:15,319
in Germany in milliseconds it's not here

927
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,999
so this trace tracing system is a bit

928
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:19,369
complex not only complex

929
00:50:16,999 --> 00:50:21,529
in many investigations that we can make

930
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:25,130
when tracing up a communication this

931
00:50:21,529 --> 00:50:28,910
this means it's full of errors it's

932
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:30,680
interesting the load balancing is

933
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:35,239
fundamental have many projects to do

934
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:37,279
this load balancers maybe you don't want

935
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:42,380
to hear that but our internet providers

936
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:47,420
use load balances do you know about our

937
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:48,799
Reuters information exchange it's kind

938
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,319
of a single mesh I think the machine

939
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:53,239
cannot store all those data and had to

940
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:57,579
have all this traffic they distribute it

941
00:50:53,239 --> 00:51:00,579
between the various machines and here

942
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:03,589
the most important photons are the

943
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:05,720
database of service the Oracle license

944
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:10,339
is very expensive other technologies are

945
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:14,180
quite expensive so what do we do we hire

946
00:51:10,339 --> 00:51:16,519
a portion of a database to a provider

947
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:21,009
for a monthly payment which is not very

948
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:21,008
expensive so avoid the great investment

949
00:51:23,109 --> 00:51:28,729
so the question is to cloud or not to

950
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:34,670
cloud I take my infrastructure to the

951
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:36,919
cloud or not I can assess that it's if

952
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:40,039
if your infrastructure is your business

953
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:43,339
core don't put it into the cloud you

954
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:45,469
your core cannot go to a cloud that is

955
00:51:43,339 --> 00:51:49,249
shared with many people you have to

956
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:50,930
assess the risks that are associated to

957
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:53,509
change your infrastructure or put it

958
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:56,960
into the hands of other people whose

959
00:51:53,509 --> 00:52:00,739
others because the cloud model is a

960
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:03,619
collaborative economic system so we

961
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:05,539
think we have a product where there's

962
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:07,969
provider but the provider has not all

963
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:10,160
the resources so it's been shared with

964
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:12,499
the resources are shared with Amazon or

965
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,229
with another company so what I need to

966
00:52:12,499 --> 00:52:18,259
know if that is that if I have to use

967
00:52:15,229 --> 00:52:21,078
cloud computing computer I need a way to

968
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:23,479
administrate what's happening in my

969
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:26,359
cloud yes you need a well-defined plan

970
00:52:23,479 --> 00:52:29,819
for risks compliance security and

971
00:52:26,359 --> 00:52:32,069
hardware you need to define these plans

972
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:33,690
you need a lot of meetings many

973
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:36,180
questions to your provider and very

974
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:39,420
uncomfortable questions so let's imagine

975
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,749
I take my infrastructure to the to the

976
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:45,390
clouds what do I need

977
00:52:41,749 --> 00:52:49,799
it's an outsourced service external

978
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:51,989
service that you need to reap you locate

979
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:55,140
your personnel doesn't mean to put them

980
00:52:51,989 --> 00:52:57,599
on the dole but this personnel had about

981
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:59,249
all the knowledge about your physical

982
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,859
infrastructures but they know what

983
00:52:59,249 --> 00:53:06,629
happens to a piece of data from A to Z

984
00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:08,339
this your personnel know everything

985
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:10,739
about your infrastructure so you have to

986
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:14,459
relocate those people this person knows

987
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:17,609
all the the route that data follow so

988
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:21,979
you have to put your business meetings

989
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:24,630
and you have to have new ARP tool or

990
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:25,939
workflows that are more adapted to the

991
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:30,930
new infrastructure you're going to have

992
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:33,180
so will reallocate resources so I take

993
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:36,149
my infrastructure to the cloud and it's

994
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:40,019
true that I have to replace and relocate

995
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:44,249
my people and I don't know who and maybe

996
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:45,749
they're going to have it influence on my

997
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:48,089
infrastructure you need training

998
00:53:45,749 --> 00:53:52,578
training and more training I I do I

999
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:56,729
agree now we get to your favorite part

1000
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:59,009
so think now we know what the cloud is

1001
00:53:56,729 --> 00:54:04,618
how we can move around what are the

1002
00:53:59,009 --> 00:54:10,349
risks that we haven't imagined how can

1003
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:12,420
we now avoid those risks so what are the

1004
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:16,339
risks that we're going to be faced with

1005
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:19,079
first the loss of governance it's clear

1006
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:21,089
the provider is going to control what

1007
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:23,579
you do I can't control anything and

1008
00:54:21,089 --> 00:54:26,190
that's a loss of Governors and Inter

1009
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:29,609
risk how can I solve this risk well I

1010
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:32,509
have to trust him I have to trust the

1011
00:54:29,609 --> 00:54:33,719
contracts that I sign weather provider

1012
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:36,269
okay

1013
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:39,410
let's imagine this is a case of a

1014
00:54:36,269 --> 00:54:45,348
provider I'm not going to name

1015
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:48,259
they sell they sold IP voice services

1016
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:52,960
and they close their service and

1017
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:55,960
everything lost the fixed the land

1018
00:54:52,960 --> 00:55:00,020
telephone number so disappearance of

1019
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:02,869
telephone numbers another risk in this

1020
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:04,819
especially linked to the price it's not

1021
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:07,220
the same to pay for a service for and

1022
00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:09,319
for another service if I have to migrate

1023
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:12,500
the content in my own the cloud to

1024
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:15,730
another place what are the services that

1025
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:18,799
are offered to me if it was like

1026
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:21,319
telephones do I have the possibility to

1027
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:23,990
leave you because I have all the data

1028
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:26,720
can I can I leave my provider at any

1029
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:28,549
moment in time you I need freedom and

1030
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,279
you have to be careful with those

1031
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:36,410
services yes there's a risk there are

1032
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:39,530
two questions there what is the

1033
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:42,770
technology that we use the vendor log we

1034
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:44,779
are forced to use this vendor with the

1035
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:46,400
same technology or can we migrate and

1036
00:55:44,779 --> 00:55:50,390
choose another vendor with another

1037
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:53,059
technology and the providers artistic

1038
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:55,190
honesty but all providers are honest if

1039
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:56,960
I say dramas and I want to take all the

1040
00:55:55,190 --> 00:56:00,140
services to another place yes of course

1041
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,539
you can do it well Amazon has a specific

1042
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:06,589
policy it's quite serious it's quite ok

1043
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:09,349
and honest that's normal that's usual no

1044
00:56:06,589 --> 00:56:14,690
it's not ok so careful with that

1045
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:17,089
another risk the the you can't be

1046
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:20,119
isolated when using the shared resources

1047
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:22,609
during the our talk we said that shared

1048
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:25,069
resources are going to be violated on

1049
00:56:22,609 --> 00:56:27,308
many occasions it's not the same to have

1050
00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:31,579
a provider or supplier ensuring that

1051
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:33,799
that don't have anybody there it's like

1052
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:35,750
having all the share resources and

1053
00:56:33,799 --> 00:56:38,509
anybody can have access to that it's one

1054
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:41,000
of the risks yes there were specific

1055
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:43,400
failure in Amazon but there was a fault

1056
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,369
from one instance you could have access

1057
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:50,529
to hypervisors you could have an Amazon

1058
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:50,529
virtual machine with faults and errors

1059
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:56,160
the buffer overflow allowed you to have

1060
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:58,350
access to all the machines that were we

1061
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,240
were we're under the same hypervisor at

1062
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:02,279
the same time there was a programming

1063
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,350
problem there and it could be a

1064
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,170
catastrophe you can have access to

1065
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:10,740
anything in that strangers some another

1066
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:14,160
risk is compliance compliance the

1067
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:17,580
provider not only has to demonstrate to

1068
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:20,100
me that he that he has has the necessary

1069
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:23,700
resources has to allow me to make an

1070
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:26,040
audit tell me what you want but I want

1071
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:29,279
to check that it's true why because when

1072
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:32,670
I have to comply by the law to abide by

1073
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:36,210
the law here I'm responsible for that so

1074
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:40,430
this is not respected in many cases it's

1075
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:40,430
one of the highest risks that I can face

1076
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:49,859
that's interesting more risks and I

1077
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:51,630
suppose that you know that you can might

1078
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:54,590
be mining bitcoins without knowing it

1079
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:59,070
you don't know it the JavaScript systems

1080
00:57:54,590 --> 00:58:01,620
are continuously mining bitcoins any

1081
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:03,450
management interface that is accessible

1082
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:10,970
through the internet can be vulnerable

1083
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:13,560
everything is preferable so I'm plus I

1084
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:15,120
have the Browse browsers all around me

1085
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,549
for my customers and they are all

1086
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,710
vulnerable I found one of these fallen

1087
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:21,900
barbatus and the FBI discovered people

1088
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:24,540
in a in a Thorpe network because there

1089
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:28,050
was a Firefox vulnerability in the Tor

1090
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:30,210
system so maybe I don't need to update

1091
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:34,380
the systems and thanks to that I'm going

1092
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:36,140
to have a vulnerability that effect that

1093
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:39,060
through my computer and through my web

1094
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:41,549
systems people are going to access to

1095
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:48,390
all the my company's resources that's

1096
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:52,040
not very nice is it we need to adapt to

1097
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:57,150
the laws to abide by the laws and

1098
00:58:52,040 --> 00:59:00,690
regulations and I insist you have to ask

1099
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:03,870
your provider the real proof that the

1100
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:07,710
provider is Biden by the law

1101
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:10,049
and to be sure that data are destroyed

1102
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:12,060
when they should they have to guarantee

1103
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:14,610
that they're going to destroy my data

1104
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:17,850
when needed otherwise it's a risk prison

1105
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:20,550
example in a cloud company they they

1106
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:22,860
just remove the backups and they give

1107
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:25,050
them the drives to another person with

1108
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:27,660
confidential data in there in the hard

1109
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:29,700
drives or an person goes to the

1110
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:31,319
photocopier in the company they they get

1111
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,899
the hard drive out of the photocopier

1112
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:38,010
and they go away with it you know what

1113
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:41,880
it contains lots of data I have evidence

1114
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:45,840
of bank operations in banks here and

1115
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:47,610
they were contained in those photocopier

1116
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:52,770
hard drives they should have been

1117
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:55,410
destroyed if you see an old machine you

1118
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:57,570
get the manual from the machine or the

1119
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:59,220
photocopier their printer so you see all

1120
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:03,480
the photocopies that have been made at

1121
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:07,529
the copiers normally they keep a little

1122
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:10,280
log as a small snapshot of the photocopy

1123
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:13,560
that has been done you can find anything

1124
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:16,850
autopsy is a forensic software that

1125
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:20,940
allows you to study evidence and it's

1126
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:24,960
very well used you can work with the

1127
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:29,130
snapshots of virtual machines it's very

1128
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:31,350
simple not only is that the only option

1129
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:32,420
for that it will see more details about

1130
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:41,819
this

1131
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:44,120
what's more another major risk is for

1132
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,900
the technicians or administrators

1133
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,270
administrators of people that are

1134
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:51,650
directly handling the data I don't mean

1135
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:55,200
my people I mean the company that's

1136
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:58,110
stored my data I'm who my to know

1137
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,250
whether somebody's fed up their works or

1138
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:01,290
that company because they have reduced

1139
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:04,560
their wages and they do something with

1140
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:06,000
my data or some other company's datas

1141
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,390
this is one of the risks that you need

1142
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,390
to consider

1143
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:18,130
what we clear on is that you need to

1144
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:23,440
consider all these risks you need to

1145
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:26,800
have them all in your head and whether

1146
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:30,700
we like it or not when we're in a cloud

1147
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:32,590
we're going to be exposed to a series of

1148
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,399
situations and circumstances that we're

1149
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,390
not going to be able to do anything

1150
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,390
about people are going to be able to

1151
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:41,190
access from outside and they're going to

1152
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:41,190
try to access as well from inside

1153
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:50,220
what about strengthening cloud systems

1154
01:01:52,500 --> 01:02:00,460
first of all you need to have legal

1155
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:05,010
adherence especially if we encrypt we've

1156
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:08,800
got a password manager or the internal

1157
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:11,410
company management where we've got half

1158
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:15,190
of the password and the others of god´s

1159
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:18,940
the other half we always need to meet

1160
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:21,580
legal requirements we need to be sure

1161
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:23,860
that we're compliant whether that's with

1162
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:30,580
automatic tools or different

1163
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:32,890
technologies or so we need to be clear

1164
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,650
that our data are kept under the best

1165
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:39,190
conditions possible that there's a way

1166
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:41,200
of data destruction that good security

1167
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:45,370
policies have been defined that they

1168
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:50,799
used in separate environments for trials

1169
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:58,390
for production and we need to check all

1170
01:02:50,800 --> 01:03:03,160
the data environments we've tried as a

1171
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:05,890
team to get these kind of tools they're

1172
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:09,330
not too difficult to generate well we've

1173
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:13,480
brought together a whole series of tools

1174
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:16,509
for cloud authority and different

1175
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:18,460
environments from a technical viewpoint

1176
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:21,210
and from a compliance viewpoint let's

1177
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:21,210
just have a look at how they work

1178
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:27,069
so that's the theory I know it's a pain

1179
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:31,270
to listen to this but it's necessary for

1180
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:33,220
you to understand the world that we're

1181
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:36,550
moving in let's now work on the

1182
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:38,970
practical side of things and the first

1183
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:42,370
practical side of things I want to

1184
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:46,990
propose to you is because I want you to

1185
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:49,740
understand that normally a technician

1186
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:53,379
with certain amount of knowledge doesn't

1187
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:56,229
necessarily have to follow 100% of the

1188
01:03:53,380 --> 01:04:00,190
rules all the time and normally they can

1189
01:03:56,230 --> 01:04:02,950
skip some of the limitations imposed by

1190
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:05,770
systems however famous they may be let's

1191
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:08,890
have a look at how that's done I'm going

1192
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:12,240
to give you an example with a tool that

1193
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:14,980
you've probably all heard of this tool

1194
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:20,830
excel you know excel this is an

1195
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:25,290
interesting tool because you can add

1196
01:04:20,830 --> 01:04:29,200
data but I think somebody's actually

1197
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:33,460
invaded my excel sheet so I find this

1198
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:35,649
page I know this is a bit of a cliche

1199
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:37,240
but I want you to see how it works do

1200
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:43,600
you know that the majority of these

1201
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:48,430
files are actually like a zip container

1202
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:54,460
did you know that so let's have a look

1203
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:58,629
at this worksheet here I've got a sheet

1204
01:04:54,460 --> 01:05:00,850
maybe I want to edit what I'm going to

1205
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:07,990
try to do is to see what what happens

1206
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:10,810
here let's look at the end of it what

1207
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:13,990
I'm trying to find is the kind of

1208
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:17,410
password that we are using to try to

1209
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:20,589
violate this obviously on a spreadsheet

1210
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:24,700
you can try this at home and I can see

1211
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:27,810
it's got sha-512 so anything I want to

1212
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:30,799
try to touch here is going to be a bit

1213
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:34,130
difficult

1214
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:37,330
here there's some kind of protection so

1215
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:37,330
that are gonna take this

1216
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:58,900
my colleague forgot to install this

1217
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:13,559
for demo purposes I'm not I'm just gonna

1218
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:18,569
I'm gonna remove it just in case but I'm

1219
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:21,059
gonna save it this as well this is what

1220
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:25,199
any normal person would do with an Excel

1221
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:26,909
spreadsheet that means that offer much

1222
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:30,479
protection I've got it doesn't matter

1223
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:32,699
matter I'm going to able to get round

1224
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:35,819
those protections because nobody has to

1225
01:06:32,699 --> 01:06:37,859
be honest what I've just done this with

1226
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:42,329
is are just a normal office program I

1227
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:44,219
don't know if you know these kind of

1228
01:06:42,329 --> 01:06:47,609
techniques to avoid having to use the

1229
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:50,640
password but I've just done it so what

1230
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:55,709
you've just seen is one of the ways that

1231
01:06:50,640 --> 01:07:03,959
we can check to see how I can violate

1232
01:06:55,709 --> 01:07:06,328
data in a external virtual machine we

1233
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:08,399
were talking about mal practices earlier

1234
01:07:06,329 --> 01:07:11,219
we're talking about just one cable one

1235
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:16,380
cable or one channel to get to

1236
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:20,119
everything what this means is it it

1237
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:24,839
throws up very basic problems

1238
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:28,319
meaning that somebody can just save this

1239
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:30,749
or just because we're bad we don't have

1240
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:36,630
any certificates we just have the data

1241
01:07:30,749 --> 01:07:38,999
flat data what does that mean we can get

1242
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:40,499
to where all the disks are stored and

1243
01:07:38,999 --> 01:07:42,959
we're not not going to need a brute

1244
01:07:40,499 --> 01:07:46,259
force to deal with the machine we're

1245
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:48,379
just gonna access the hard drives the

1246
01:07:46,259 --> 01:07:50,569
machines hard drives

1247
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:53,249
let's just have a look at something

1248
01:07:50,569 --> 01:07:54,839
before we do that I said to you that I

1249
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:57,479
was gonna save something I want to see

1250
01:07:54,839 --> 01:08:02,659
where I've saved it because I've got an

1251
01:07:57,479 --> 01:08:08,308
access to a snapshot in this case it's a

1252
01:08:02,659 --> 01:08:11,339
virtual machine and it's a Linux align

1253
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:13,579
extinct you can just access whatever you

1254
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:13,578
want

1255
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:20,529
it's a bit like a bit knave what's

1256
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:25,450
interesting is that many people use it

1257
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:27,940
and if we did any internet searches

1258
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:30,068
you'd probably find all kinds of these

1259
01:08:27,939 --> 01:08:34,769
kinds of characteristics so making use

1260
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:37,750
of this let's just have a look now at

1261
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:40,029
its origin what can I do with this well

1262
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:42,700
we're one of the most complicated tools

1263
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:46,270
to use that there are you remember that

1264
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:47,740
I said that everything is done on

1265
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:48,940
snapshot that's what a snapshot looks

1266
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:52,660
like so it doesn't matter if it's in

1267
01:08:48,939 --> 01:08:55,629
Linux Windows or whatever what do I do I

1268
01:08:52,660 --> 01:09:00,580
go and see if there's any sensitive

1269
01:08:55,630 --> 01:09:05,520
information here maybe there is you can

1270
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:10,479
do this at home on your own systems or

1271
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:11,799
outside systems and I'm going to see if

1272
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,669
I've got any access to anything

1273
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:14,670
interesting here

1274
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:25,299
and let's see what happens

1275
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:35,000
it's a big compressed file but doesn't

1276
01:09:32,988 --> 01:09:42,139
matter if it's got one Giga or 30 gigas

1277
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:44,000
in the file if you want to do any

1278
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:49,000
forensic investigation with this it

1279
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:56,600
could also be useful because I can see

1280
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:01,310
what's inside a on our car a file of a

1281
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:03,440
virtual machine or a snapshot that's the

1282
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:09,739
same with Linux with Windows it doesn't

1283
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:14,210
matter so what we're saying he's here

1284
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:16,730
that in a Linux machine we have

1285
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:20,330
different levels of permits within files

1286
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:24,110
and if we get to hard disks of these

1287
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:25,850
machines then we can avoid all those

1288
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:29,630
files we can change what if we want

1289
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:34,810
without any kind of permit at all this

1290
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:37,489
is the content of a disk unit in Windows

1291
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:41,870
imagine you all know how this works you

1292
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:46,699
can see that number of users all the

1293
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:48,739
different contents that's what we're

1294
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:51,440
talking about when we say we're using

1295
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:54,739
shared infrastructures these kind of

1296
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:57,080
risks are out there I don't know if any

1297
01:10:54,739 --> 01:10:59,089
of you had heard of these systems when

1298
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:01,400
using these resources but this is one of

1299
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:03,469
the things that we consider you don't

1300
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:06,889
need any kind of exaggerated knowledge

1301
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:09,100
to access these things so let's just

1302
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:09,100
look

1303
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:18,820
because we were in a hurry we've brought

1304
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:21,540
with us the machine that we're

1305
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:29,889
developing in our app that we're forever

1306
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:34,300
modifying and also because we've got a

1307
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:39,330
lot of data in it so we didn't want to

1308
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:39,330
share all of the data let's start it

1309
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:50,150
and I'll leave it in your hands this

1310
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:52,250
tool that we've developed and which is

1311
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:59,000
what it's going to allow us to do is to

1312
01:11:52,250 --> 01:12:05,150
group together a series of auditing

1313
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:07,790
tools simply it's going to be available

1314
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:09,379
in the github as like look like all

1315
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:15,350
presentations that we have been given

1316
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:17,739
here now the password isn't one two

1317
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,739
three four

1318
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:29,280
you can choose a tool from here who's

1319
01:12:26,469 --> 01:12:29,280
trying to connect

1320
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:50,000
it's a collection of tools not all of

1321
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:54,670
the ones that we use all the time but

1322
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:58,070
it's just for the demo today we also

1323
01:12:54,670 --> 01:13:01,180
wanted to show you the ones that are

1324
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:06,830
developed by Netflix I like chaos monkey

1325
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:14,060
because it makes my colleagues in

1326
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:24,050
production go mad what it does is it

1327
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:27,110
makes a different operations go somewhat

1328
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:29,510
imagine it it turns that the machines

1329
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:31,610
off just in a random fashion it's to

1330
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:35,270
create chaos it's quite obvious chaos

1331
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:37,519
monkey imagine it's a monkey going

1332
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:40,160
around turning things on but we're going

1333
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:45,200
to talk here about Prowler Prowler is a

1334
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:46,970
tool we're going to use it with Amazon

1335
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:49,940
in this case and what it's going to do

1336
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:51,590
is give us information about the

1337
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:56,860
compliance and basic security of our

1338
01:13:51,590 --> 01:14:01,840
accounts it's got the default passwords

1339
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:01,839
whether we've left any ports open etc

1340
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:29,030
well is that I'm internal this tool lets

1341
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:31,570
us check users users that have kept the

1342
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:37,490
same password for more than 90 days

1343
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:39,559
it'll give us some basic advice but some

1344
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:41,150
will depend upon the kind of

1345
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:44,090
infrastructure that we've deployed and

1346
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:49,519
what I like about this tool is that it's

1347
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:52,730
multi-tenant and we can set it up with

1348
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:55,040
different instances and different AWS

1349
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:59,450
accounts at the same time of course

1350
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:03,470
we'll gradually see the warnings they

1351
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:07,670
remind us that we get and if there's a

1352
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:11,030
serious violation it won't tell us

1353
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:13,900
so we'll see default passwords ports

1354
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:17,349
that we're using and an even malpractice

1355
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:23,509
and here in this specific case it's

1356
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:25,570
showing us several faults for example

1357
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:29,300
you haven't generated encrypted

1358
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:32,750
passwords some makers are giving you

1359
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:36,020
strange values this also allows us to

1360
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:38,930
give our own rules and codes but we need

1361
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:41,870
to be aware that we have these tools

1362
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:44,990
what's important is that we spend part

1363
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:50,300
of our time our infrastructure time to

1364
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:53,450
create and maintain a state of art where

1365
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:56,600
all these tools are reflected and

1366
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:58,160
documented in the updated checked and

1367
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,650
try to use them as much as possible and

1368
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:03,769
automate them how can they be automated

1369
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:08,509
well this is part of the audits that we

1370
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:10,970
have to carry out and both for the risks

1371
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:14,630
that we've looked at and all the things

1372
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:19,250
that's out there we realized via a

1373
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:22,400
friend the other day that their new VG

1374
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:25,040
PD are gonna force all public

1375
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:27,650
institutions to have two audits per year

1376
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:30,860
and that's gonna be very interesting

1377
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:35,159
because people are reluctant to do so

1378
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:38,280
they will say okay why me why me you're

1379
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:45,000
gonna make me do that yes it's as simple

1380
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:50,099
as that and I've seen it firsthand from

1381
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:51,929
a security viewpoint by the way this is

1382
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:55,800
a little bit obsolete now that you need

1383
01:16:51,929 --> 01:16:58,770
to remember that it's just obligatory

1384
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,300
and it's gonna be sukira

1385
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:03,060
for everybody it's gonna be safer for

1386
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:08,610
everybody if people are forced to do an

1387
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:12,179
audit twice a year I was just having a

1388
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:18,000
look at it because despite the fact that

1389
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:20,719
this is a trial account for this demo

1390
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:26,100
you can see that with a default set up

1391
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:27,330
all kinds of different problems that

1392
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:32,969
need to be taken into account of being

1393
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:35,760
thrown up so we have to look at it first

1394
01:17:32,969 --> 01:17:38,250
and we can see that these tools you can

1395
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,810
have fun lots of accessibility when I

1396
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:41,940
say lots of it you're going to find a

1397
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:44,550
bit more and more you need to see that

1398
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:48,960
the information that you get is reliable

1399
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:50,850
and updated otherwise as you can

1400
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:55,679
probably imagine the cloud world is an

1401
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:58,440
ever-changing world and a tool from four

1402
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,520
years ago isn't useful because it's not

1403
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:02,759
going to take into account many of the

1404
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,580
things that exist today and it's not

1405
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,260
just this what we need when we use cloud

1406
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:09,330
because this here a series of things

1407
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:14,489
that actually won't happen you'd also

1408
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:20,389
need the possibility of carrying out pen

1409
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:20,388
tests and try to monitor them

1410
01:18:21,449 --> 01:18:25,719
many of the providers that you're gonna

1411
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:28,210
have will refuse to do this they won't

1412
01:18:25,719 --> 01:18:37,030
want to do this we're also saying that

1413
01:18:28,210 --> 01:18:42,219
these kind of tools there's one out

1414
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:44,440
there called kit ployed which talks

1415
01:18:42,219 --> 01:18:48,790
about many tools there's that it's got

1416
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:52,299
this own tool which standardized as many

1417
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:55,360
pest pet test tools we've got a small

1418
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:58,510
spin-off as well and each cloud platform

1419
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:01,839
is its own little world if we have them

1420
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:06,909
where or as here it's mostly all the

1421
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:10,290
same but if we turned more to a type of

1422
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:12,579
open nebula infrastructure OpenStack

1423
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:15,670
things are a lot different especially in

1424
01:19:12,579 --> 01:19:19,150
OpenStack where you have one machine for

1425
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:22,360
each essential service of our cloud one

1426
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:25,598
which is for users another which move

1427
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:28,150
some messaging service between the

1428
01:19:25,599 --> 01:19:31,540
different machines another which is just

1429
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:34,900
for the net which is neutrino another

1430
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:37,300
which is just for storage to bring

1431
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:39,989
together all the different components or

1432
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:42,670
infrastructure disks that we have and

1433
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:45,309
make that this literally works now can

1434
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:48,159
you audit all of that you have to start

1435
01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:53,469
with the basics you're always going to

1436
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:57,460
need to have some kind of a matrix we're

1437
01:19:53,469 --> 01:19:58,869
actually from a legal viewpoint you're

1438
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:01,389
gonna have to meet all the necessary

1439
01:19:58,869 --> 01:20:03,540
requirements in addition to that you're

1440
01:20:01,389 --> 01:20:07,679
gonna need on that matrix to gradually

1441
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:13,480
incorporate more and more technical

1442
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:17,440
advice why because it changes very

1443
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:19,419
rapidly as Antonio says in open nebula

1444
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:24,388
which is used a lot I don't if you've no

1445
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:24,389
open nebula it's a cloud system

1446
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:30,810
set up by several providers all the

1447
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:37,240
major manufacturers have joined it and

1448
01:20:30,810 --> 01:20:40,840
in fact governments have taken part in

1449
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:43,840
it and overnight I think it was on

1450
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:46,360
version 8 they changed all the

1451
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:49,800
management part everybody that was

1452
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:55,980
certified and used to using this system

1453
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:59,320
this change has just destroyed them

1454
01:20:55,980 --> 01:21:01,780
you've found all these different badly

1455
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:06,000
set up panels something that's very

1456
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:06,000
important just in a simple search

1457
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:14,380
because of this this always takes us to

1458
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:18,010
the same conclusion which is that

1459
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:19,770
training is very important now this

1460
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:25,000
issue of ports and we're seeing that now

1461
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:28,660
you can see what your open an

1462
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,460
interesting point of this auditing

1463
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:32,710
system it's not that it's just what I'm

1464
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:35,110
seeing but that it produces a report

1465
01:21:32,710 --> 01:21:37,540
that can be used because there's some of

1466
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:39,040
these kind of audits in which the

1467
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:44,830
reports that it produces aren't very

1468
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:47,380
good within these pen tests let's look

1469
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:50,080
at the most basic pen test the most

1470
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:52,950
basic of course is always going to be

1471
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,950
nmap

1472
01:21:55,470 --> 01:22:00,240
then depending upon the type of

1473
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:04,800
infrastructure

1474
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:04,800
they'll some that try to look at the

1475
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:15,330
faults that I have what about sub

1476
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:20,860
open-source pen tests there's what start

1477
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:22,210
you can use nexus open bus depart

1478
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:25,360
depending on the kind of pentas you want

1479
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:29,010
to carry out and if i want to carry out

1480
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:31,690
an audit before contracting somebody

1481
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:34,270
just for the basics what is the most

1482
01:22:31,690 --> 01:22:36,059
important part of these audits what's

1483
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:40,960
the most important part of these tools

1484
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:43,960
but you have to tool around because any

1485
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:49,890
tool that you have the worst thing that

1486
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:52,840
could happen is that you use too much

1487
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:55,000
too many resources that you destroy the

1488
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:57,340
information that's simply so the first

1489
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,210
thing is to guarantee that our tool

1490
01:22:57,340 --> 01:23:02,890
isn't intrusive if I wanted something

1491
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:04,510
that's intrusive that I need to be clear

1492
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:12,880
on that but it's not something that

1493
01:23:04,510 --> 01:23:14,920
anybody can do this is never end I think

1494
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:18,250
it's got more information here that then

1495
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:24,700
you need you've left the port open it's

1496
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:29,290
a broad audit a thorough one maybe we've

1497
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:33,370
loaded too many machines but whilst this

1498
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:36,040
carries on if the colleague that helped

1499
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:37,809
us design this thinks that we've done

1500
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:40,170
something bad can you please send us a

1501
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:40,170
whatsapp

1502
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:50,420
and in these kinds of audits it's

1503
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,520
important the technology that we use the

1504
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:54,990
providers what tools we have what budget

1505
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:58,170
and also training training training

1506
01:23:54,990 --> 01:24:00,269
these kind of events a cyber camp event

1507
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:07,080
where you've got these kind of workshops

1508
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:09,060
where we can see how complex it is to

1509
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:11,690
cover everybody's expectations to meet

1510
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:13,770
everybody's expectations are still very

1511
01:24:11,690 --> 01:24:17,820
important because they provide us a lot

1512
01:24:13,770 --> 01:24:21,450
of information useful information that's

1513
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:23,309
true so coming back to the issue of

1514
01:24:21,450 --> 01:24:26,540
risks this is something that I've left

1515
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:29,130
to one side awareness training and

1516
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:32,460
compliance is really important for all

1517
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:34,040
these sort of things I think we should

1518
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:38,730
stop it now because it's just

1519
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:40,620
duplicating we've done something wrong

1520
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:42,660
what either we put too many counts in

1521
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:45,720
there or we've asked it to look at too

1522
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:47,960
many machines let's talk about the

1523
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,960
others

1524
01:24:49,360 --> 01:25:00,429
let's have a look at another machine

1525
01:24:53,050 --> 01:25:02,620
that's a bit more prepared this is

1526
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:05,650
another one that we're trying at

1527
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:08,950
lunchtime what we've included a series

1528
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:11,349
of additional tools within the muniya

1529
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:14,950
menu and we're gonna upload this to

1530
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:23,740
github and we'll explain how more tools

1531
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:26,620
can be added it's made to measure we're

1532
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:29,830
gonna have one version for free that

1533
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:34,330
everybody will use and that'll simplify

1534
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:39,490
our use this moving back to pen test

1535
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:43,680
tools sometimes give you very complex

1536
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:43,679
they can be very complex reports Oh

1537
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:50,890
what's up is the one of the most

1538
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:54,429
recommended one if you're using it as

1539
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:58,360
updates it's quite frequent the updates

1540
01:25:54,430 --> 01:26:00,960
and it can be a good starting point but

1541
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:03,099
we need to consider that one of the most

1542
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:07,240
complicated things that you find are

1543
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:10,690
false positives we like these kinds of

1544
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:12,400
tools and then one that we use

1545
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:15,750
internally is a little bit more advanced

1546
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:22,139
it's got some additional options because

1547
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:24,190
we work from the attack tree perspective

1548
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:27,160
we try to see what sort of

1549
01:26:24,190 --> 01:26:32,169
infrastructure the customer has and with

1550
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:37,750
that define the attack plan and just use

1551
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:39,310
a logical port mark the order in what

1552
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:42,150
we're going to audit and see what

1553
01:26:39,310 --> 01:26:42,150
information we get

1554
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:48,470
in this case it's always gonna ask the

1555
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:55,070
same thing and we can choose the ones

1556
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:58,760
that we want to run and then wait it is

1557
01:26:55,070 --> 01:27:00,860
very important to define the scope no it

1558
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,060
seems we can't connect that's what

1559
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:06,620
happens when you're doing things life

1560
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:10,400
it's very important to define the scope

1561
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:15,580
of an audit because recently the other

1562
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:15,580
day I was designing a sort of a a home

1563
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:22,220
home system using over get to make

1564
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,780
backup systems and I was looking at over

1565
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:29,750
gates and seeing what I had and I didn't

1566
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:33,469
realize that machine that I was sending

1567
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:35,560
the resources from had more than the one

1568
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:41,600
that was receiving it this is quite

1569
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:43,700
common with open test trials we may see

1570
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:51,860
that we've got more resources than the

1571
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:58,250
customer and we may create problems so

1572
01:27:51,860 --> 01:28:02,150
scope is very important when you do this

1573
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:03,740
on pre-production environments rather

1574
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:05,210
than production environments these are

1575
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:08,860
perhaps their cover the best piece of a

1576
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:08,860
pieces of advice that we can give you

1577
01:28:16,450 --> 01:28:20,010
this is another thing that you need to

1578
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,780
consider

1579
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:25,140
of course it depends on the type of

1580
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:26,639
clouds that you've got but you can't put

1581
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:28,650
it in anybody's hands

1582
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,850
that's a terrible problem we talk about

1583
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:32,160
data but not just when you talk about

1584
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:34,620
data remember that one of the things

1585
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:37,170
that we could provoke is excess

1586
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:40,230
information it's not just much data

1587
01:28:37,170 --> 01:28:46,760
traffic butter might actually start

1588
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:46,759
creating dirty data and ruin somebody

1589
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:57,889
especially when automating a connection

1590
01:28:54,989 --> 01:28:57,889
test in a database

1591
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:03,710
you get sorry really

1592
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:11,489
unforeseen but when you talk about

1593
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:14,280
typical pen test tools just be careful

1594
01:29:11,489 --> 01:29:17,339
cuz otherwise you might ruin something

1595
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:20,489
not just the expense account but it may

1596
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:22,700
well be we don't want to corrupt

1597
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:25,259
information that's also very important

1598
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:27,000
if you've got any questions while we're

1599
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:29,250
trying to get this to work please do ask

1600
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:35,550
them something we're doing wrong because

1601
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:37,050
we can't get the final report if you've

1602
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:40,970
got any further questions while we're

1603
01:29:37,050 --> 01:29:43,530
trying to make this run please interrupt

1604
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:45,810
for some reason it's not giving us the

1605
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:48,179
final report okay at the end when it

1606
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:50,989
finishes it will create a report and

1607
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:53,460
where we'll be able to see all the

1608
01:29:50,989 --> 01:29:56,879
reminders and warnings any problems that

1609
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:58,770
we may have had if it doesn't finish

1610
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:04,470
today it doesn't matter we'll still let

1611
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:07,860
you use the tool with a free account any

1612
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:11,460
questions before we get to the next part

1613
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:18,030
if you have no questions we'll try to

1614
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:20,670
finish I've still 20 minutes to go the

1615
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:26,809
way to talk about infrastructures then

1616
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:26,810
we'll be over no questions

1617
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:46,210
my name is Pedro national providers

1618
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:49,210
within the big ones and if you have to

1619
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:51,360
abide by the data protection rules or

1620
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:55,570
security national security legislation

1621
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:59,650
do you know some any in Spanish apply is

1622
01:30:55,570 --> 01:31:02,920
giving guarantees we cannot mention any

1623
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:06,219
of those I cannot make an advert

1624
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:12,460
advertising there are cloud and local

1625
01:31:06,219 --> 01:31:15,449
cloud suppliers in Spain they have they

1626
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:19,929
specify where the data center is why

1627
01:31:15,449 --> 01:31:22,928
that I won't mention here has a data

1628
01:31:19,929 --> 01:31:25,150
center in China and in Spain and you can

1629
01:31:22,929 --> 01:31:34,300
choose if you want to hire those

1630
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:38,589
services in China or in Spain after the

1631
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:40,570
talk we can mention three or four

1632
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:42,880
supplies I don't want to be in conflict

1633
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:45,880
with some of the providers are friends

1634
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:53,710
others are not friends of mine so I can

1635
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:57,040
help you later with the names in theory

1636
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:59,500
any provider having their installations

1637
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:01,449
here in Spain have to abide by the

1638
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:05,920
Spanish legislation not just a

1639
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:09,388
legislation you need to know that we

1640
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:12,400
have always to audit providers

1641
01:32:09,389 --> 01:32:15,579
you can't ask simple questions are you

1642
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:18,309
going to separate the data route do you

1643
01:32:15,579 --> 01:32:20,139
have 24 hours personnel is it yours is

1644
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:23,530
it third parties who can access service

1645
01:32:20,139 --> 01:32:25,420
if other customers can get in do I share

1646
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:30,369
my infrastructures with many customers

1647
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:32,949
if this burns down what happens there

1648
01:32:30,369 --> 01:32:36,280
was a nice video authoring questions

1649
01:32:32,949 --> 01:32:39,519
nobody can answer the procedure guy

1650
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:41,530
there on the fourth row can cover that

1651
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,720
because they offer simple products if

1652
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:45,910
there is a bomb falling on the

1653
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:48,940
Center if there's a ruin with a big

1654
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:53,320
crater what happens if the bomb Falls

1655
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:55,450
here how do you solve this problem well

1656
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:59,049
the great vast majority of data center

1657
01:32:55,450 --> 01:33:04,269
have a special service called human

1658
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:06,550
court there are security guards they're

1659
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:09,130
not even going to look the crater but

1660
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:11,800
they're going to to place themselves

1661
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:13,600
around the crater so nobody can see and

1662
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:16,840
get there this is good for business

1663
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:19,060
continuity if you this data have been

1664
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:21,220
destroyed forever secondly how much do I

1665
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:24,130
have to pay for that do you have

1666
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:25,900
replicated the data some you know some

1667
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:28,030
other place in Madrid you can have the

1668
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:30,519
data center here but you can have

1669
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:34,420
connect to other servers with fiber if

1670
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:37,780
it's a data center crushes you need to

1671
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:41,350
have another Center all data centers in

1672
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:46,090
Madrid have suffered zero the absolute

1673
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:48,670
zero this happens all over the place but

1674
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:50,200
this if this happened with the cloud

1675
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:53,350
virtualization technology all the

1676
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:55,210
infrastructures will restart another

1677
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:58,180
data centers we're not going to lose

1678
01:33:55,210 --> 01:34:00,370
work we are going to stop for a long

1679
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:03,580
time but it's important to know if that

1680
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:05,920
backup server is still in the house in

1681
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:08,350
the same city in Spain or in China those

1682
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,870
audits are very important when your

1683
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:13,630
project is big and important or when

1684
01:34:10,870 --> 01:34:16,150
there's it's very relevant the provider

1685
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:18,580
is going to answer that question you're

1686
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:21,730
going to have them a meeting you will

1687
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:25,480
see the data center you will have

1688
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:30,339
explanations about there the generators

1689
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:31,719
the gas the fuel is and another building

1690
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:34,060
they're going to give you all the

1691
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:39,550
technical details of how a data server

1692
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:41,170
works if it's a good provider and they

1693
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:43,230
should give you the explanations and

1694
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:46,390
they would and they normally have

1695
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:48,790
standards and certifications ISO ISO

1696
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:51,490
standard safer I would hire or service

1697
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:54,940
of this type in Spain first of all I'd

1698
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:57,599
like to go to see the providers our data

1699
01:34:54,940 --> 01:35:00,730
center he can show it to you

1700
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,830
there are areas in CPD's that we can

1701
01:35:00,730 --> 01:35:09,429
consider as critical you can't get in of

1702
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:17,080
course you will have answers about the

1703
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:21,010
features you will know where bank data

1704
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:23,040
are managed but you can't get in but you

1705
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:27,730
have to be sure that they have

1706
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:30,640
certifications my advice is that well

1707
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:33,030
when I make it I want to see the things

1708
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:35,080
I want to see the in the facilities

1709
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:37,450
don't tell me what are your

1710
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:39,220
certifications I want evidence of that

1711
01:35:37,450 --> 01:35:41,740
because I'm the person responsible for

1712
01:35:39,220 --> 01:35:45,100
everything happening later and even if I

1713
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:47,440
can't offer you that you can change and

1714
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:56,050
you do or maybe it's not necessary for

1715
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:57,849
you but you can choose any questions so

1716
01:35:56,050 --> 01:36:01,450
we couldn't see the report it would be

1717
01:35:57,850 --> 01:36:02,470
quite interesting to see it and we are

1718
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:06,370
late for lunch

1719
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:08,470
I think we can stop it now we could stop

1720
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:09,440
now if you want to any questions great

1721
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:17,140
thank you

1722
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:17,139
[Applause]
