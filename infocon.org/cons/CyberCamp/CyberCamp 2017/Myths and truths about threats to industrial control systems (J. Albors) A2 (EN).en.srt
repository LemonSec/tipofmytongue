00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,170
[Applause]

2
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,939
the risk impact estar aqui con esta

3
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:32,829
presenter fiona masks

4
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:34,870
pero much me impact well for me it's a

5
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:41,079
what's a shock to give a presentation

6
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:43,839
but it and it's a shocker also to have

7
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:50,140
services which we consider to be a basic

8
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:53,830
like gas light electricity but what if

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:58,750
all of a sudden this goes time and it

10
00:00:53,830 --> 00:01:01,930
just disappears black out how long would

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:05,049
it take us to start panicking start

12
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:10,479
seeing riots in the street things that

13
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:14,829
we've seen in movies but an awful day

14
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,630
these things could happen what's the

15
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:18,398
story in Spain how's the situation in

16
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,429
Spain let's look at it what do we

17
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:22,300
consider critical infrastructure this is

18
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,220
a good question

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,979
and by the way this is something that

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:30,539
isn't clear all the way for instance we

21
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:34,600
have a water supply plants energy

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:37,320
systems we always use nuclear plants

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,979
because people are really scared of this

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,380
systems like defense for instance that

25
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:48,630
may include components that may be

26
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:51,970
managed by control systems that are

27
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,670
similar to the ones we use in companies

28
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:57,970
but we also have other systems like for

29
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:02,470
instance telecommunications television

30
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:07,180
radio and infrastructures that allow for

31
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:09,008
communication between different regions

32
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,290
in order to get this and then later I

33
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,238
took two trains one from Valencia to

34
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,879
Madrid and one from Madrid descent and

35
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:22,030
that could have used other alternative

36
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:26,069
means yes I could have there's also this

37
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:28,400
is also applied for traffic roads but

38
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:33,560
private sector

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:38,090
companies always need security a place

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,519
full of frigerators for instance must be

41
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,439
working in order for the food to stay

42
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:47,329
fresh and healthy is this a critical

43
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:51,230
infrastructure nobody uses similar

44
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:55,599
systems what you see here is a control

45
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:58,849
panel something that a technician

46
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,339
somebody would be looking at or somebody

47
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:04,638
from maintenance here you can see

48
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,500
pressure pumps etc and these are things

49
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,659
that we humans can interpreters

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,760
interpret and these are called

51
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:16,578
human-machine interfaces and we also

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,769
have to bear in mind that all this

53
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:23,090
information comes from somewhere it is

54
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:28,939
processed by systems that are in charge

55
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:31,849
of managing all the information coming

56
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,948
from different sectors sensors and

57
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:37,010
probes in order for this to be

58
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:40,129
translated into our own language in

59
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:45,198
order ferocity understand what is

60
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:46,790
happening so in the end these sensors

61
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:52,299
must be connected right from an

62
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:55,459
industrial sort of oven or furnace to

63
00:03:52,299 --> 00:04:00,099
set of washing machine machines or

64
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:03,229
dryers or a reactor in a nuclear plant

65
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:05,869
so we need to manage our these sensors

66
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:10,879
in the right manner in an automated or

67
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:14,090
manual fashion you choose like the

68
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,829
previous speaker said there's there's an

69
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:21,289
engine called should' and this is like

70
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,659
Google and this allows us to look for

71
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:27,560
internet devices or such of them

72
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:30,560
computers industrial control systems and

73
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,290
you find the funny things like these for

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,900
instance were says nuke

75
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:41,000
Engineering sounds like fun or other

76
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:44,359
systems in the network that you can

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,640
access and look at it and in the West

78
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,410
possible case you can even control

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,599
somebody decided well these systems are

80
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,850
fine but I want to be able to control

81
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,920
them remotely from the house across the

82
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:02,750
way so is this necessary maybe not but

83
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,630
it's more comfortable and this is that

84
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,720
where problems are started here we just

85
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:13,930
have a few from the last a few years I'm

86
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,930
just going to focus on the one that I

87
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:26,090
highlighted since 1982 even though this

88
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:28,580
is an event that we need to be cautious

89
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,039
with because it is something that

90
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,950
happened during the Cold War and what

91
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,530
we're seeing in 2017 many things have

92
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:42,710
happened in between some of them were

93
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:47,719
made public or the public or the others

94
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:52,729
weren't and to begin with let's focus on

95
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:57,500
something that was a landmark when

96
00:05:52,730 --> 00:06:04,880
people started speaking about industrial

97
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:08,840
facilities security Stuxnet here this is

98
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,830
when systems started detecting something

99
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:17,560
in Iran something that was focused in

100
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:22,490
this place natum which is the heart of

101
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:25,310
Iranian Iranian nuclear program those of

102
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,680
you who are young won't remember but the

103
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:31,520
problem there is that the government in

104
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,510
Iran wanted to produce nuclear fuel for

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,330
their

106
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,490
plants they are entitled to you of

107
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,870
course but other countries didn't like

108
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,110
this because they thought that there's

109
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:45,080
nuclear fuel could be used for weapons

110
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,570
for instance so what was done about this

111
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,640
in the first place information was

112
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:57,230
gathered it was discovered that this

113
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:59,630
plant was used in PLC system by a well

114
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,390
known company called Siemens and they

115
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:12,200
could be attacked so these systems

116
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:15,409
together with uranium machines well this

117
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,750
could lead to a problem this is just a

118
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:23,540
summary bit now going down to the

119
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:26,090
details this attack happen the place you

120
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,510
just saw it's not a place you can access

121
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:31,940
easily or there's no connection for

122
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:35,150
workers to be able to see football games

123
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:38,780
no there were very well done no external

124
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:45,520
system was used some USB devices were

125
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:48,679
used in this attack they found out which

126
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,760
technische scientists had action which

127
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,100
access to this plant and they infected

128
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:59,390
us bees in order for them to take them

129
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:03,110
into the plant and in order to for them

130
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:06,020
to do their job so why do I believe that

131
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,500
this is still the more advanced sort of

132
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,810
threat

133
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,570
well because five of ulnar abilities

134
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,480
were used and there was no patch to

135
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,349
would solve them and so far many of

136
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:25,690
these things were this will allow for

137
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:28,220
the code execution by viewing files and

138
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,580
vulnerabilities that allowed to move

139
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,880
around that internal network making use

140
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:39,380
of security and gaps and

141
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:46,759
one or several USBs in the ideas to know

142
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:49,490
which systems systems could interact and

143
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:53,449
to have a threat that would do things

144
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,660
like we're about to see how did they

145
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:59,120
know which our systems were being used

146
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:03,589
the funny thing is that the propaganda

147
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:07,339
of the Iranian government allowed us to

148
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:10,910
know this these these pictures were

149
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:13,550
taken during a visit of the President to

150
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,680
the plant here you can see in red you

151
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:20,120
see which machines were working at the

152
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:23,779
time and details in the control panels

153
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:27,769
with blown-up pictures where you see

154
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:31,670
people working and also details like the

155
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:35,360
evolves in this uranium machine in

156
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:39,349
poverty no who was using this from then

157
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,380
on map had to be done and to see which

158
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:47,509
systems could be van vulnerable so what

159
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:51,350
happened funny smart attack well the

160
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:55,970
data that were fed from centrifugal

161
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:59,930
machines to operators workers were

162
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:04,420
normally but actually they were fake

163
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:07,489
because the machines were not working as

164
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,990
supposedly they were working and the

165
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:15,079
field that was being produced nothing

166
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:17,449
none of that fuel could be used because

167
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:22,099
this could be used as a few the ND

168
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:25,849
program the nuclear Iranian program was

169
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:30,670
delayed because of this problem and it

170
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:34,020
is estimated that almost 1000 of these

171
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:42,569
centrifuge machines

172
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:44,939
had to be thrown away it was behind all

173
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,540
this well nothing has been said about

174
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,300
this officially anyway one who doesn't

175
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:54,930
need to be too smart you know that

176
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,920
Israel didn't like this Iranian program

177
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,000
at all

178
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,870
so obviously many people were interested

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,560
in this plant not working so now we move

180
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:11,089
to 2014 it's no longer Iran now we're

181
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,949
moving to a very nice region which is in

182
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:16,350
a conflict right now and I'm speaking

183
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:23,630
about Ukraine and what's happening in

184
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:23,630
Ukraine in Ukraine many workers in

185
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:32,160
utilities or other plants started

186
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,130
receiving mails like we do on a daily

187
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,120
basis but funny sort of males males like

188
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:42,330
this one supposedly comes from the

189
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:49,860
Minister for industrial policies in

190
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:52,230
Ukraine and with an attachment zip file

191
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:57,080
and behind it there's something that is

192
00:11:52,230 --> 00:12:02,130
hearing like a document but that can be

193
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:05,010
executed in this one this is used in

194
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,640
order to attack a critical structure by

195
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:10,290
somebody who has controlled to these

196
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:14,900
facilities when they realized that it

197
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:23,550
was no longer easy to include this

198
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:28,240
executable thank you VIP then Ukraine

199
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:31,559
started having problems with Russia

200
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,480
everything that was related to war army

201
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:38,399
dissidents rebels that was quite

202
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:45,220
interesting so what did hackers do they

203
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:48,339
used supposed report it was hidden

204
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:52,899
behind a PowerPoint presentation there

205
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:54,579
was information about these commands and

206
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,499
this is what the operator the worker

207
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:59,258
could see what he couldn't see what was

208
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:01,809
happening behind all this and here two

209
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:05,499
files were being uploaded and that were

210
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:09,459
embedded in those documents two files

211
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:13,679
that were hit him in location and one of

212
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:17,529
the most hidden behind the daughter gif

213
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:22,149
that could be run that was exist

214
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:26,259
beautiful abrir una Puerta drosera in

215
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:31,809
esto sistemas that was so that's why

216
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:53,069
remotely hacker could do anything could

217
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:53,069
do anything so all the criminals within

218
00:13:53,910 --> 00:14:03,660
this is an example and we saw many more

219
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:06,790
they started including new functions

220
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:11,379
they didn't want to leave a trail so

221
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:15,389
they wanted to destroy the hard disk

222
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:18,339
they wanted to destroy once they had

223
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:25,779
whatever they wanted to do they

224
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:29,319
destroyed the this is very you want to

225
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:32,459
do forensics sort of analysis because

226
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:38,878
you want to know which fossa have been

227
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:42,160
downloaded and which ones have been run

228
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,230
if they didn't want to destroy the whole

229
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:49,600
disk hard this they looked for the

230
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:53,740
extensions they erased them and not only

231
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,549
this but apart from this they did other

232
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,980
things they used another alternative or

233
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:02,079
they used another pathway since they saw

234
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,910
that the issue of macros works and

235
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:08,429
sometimes it doesn't work what they do

236
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:19,469
it was two trojan eyes a legitimate

237
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:29,410
application for instance SSH Trojan

238
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:32,290
version left password default password

239
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,868
embedded there so that an attack from

240
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:37,329
the outside could access that machine

241
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:50,260
that was

242
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:53,350
compromised to have a second entry gate

243
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:57,470
the conclusion from others was that

244
00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:02,810
those two dates especially 23rd of

245
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:07,040
December 2015 a blackout happened that

246
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:09,680
affected around 500,000 people in an

247
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,959
area in Ukraine now let's imagine the

248
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,160
situation 20,000 a third of December

249
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:19,849
Ukraine those of you sitting here think

250
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:25,010
it's cold or chilly imagine but it was

251
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:32,770
like in Ukraine December no lighting no

252
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:36,890
heating no possibility to use any

253
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:37,670
electrical device this represents a

254
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,819
concern

255
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:43,969
antek this really is because it's

256
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:50,060
affecting you a very important part of a

257
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:53,390
region that fighting a neighbor people

258
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,160
start coming up with theories of what

259
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,589
could have happened whether this could

260
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,750
have been an attack and the media and

261
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:02,150
everything so what happened actually

262
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,050
after analyzing they see that we saw

263
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:09,530
that even though black energy cannot be

264
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:13,369
the main component of the attack even

265
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:17,649
though it had been used by criminals in

266
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:21,530
order to access and to destroy any trace

267
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:26,300
any traces of the attack and if you

268
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:28,520
wouldn't know a worker felt at the time

269
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:34,580
in that situation I brought you a video

270
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:39,770
clip where you can see attackers took

271
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:41,960
control here you can see the the

272
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,940
operator of the workers not touching

273
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,630
anything is somebody from the outside in

274
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,760
this case there was no problem

275
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,880
screen wasn't connected to any critical

276
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,610
system but this affected the good

277
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,930
operation of the plant can you hear the

278
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:01,990
workers saying what's so well this

279
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:12,150
computer wasn't connected they were

280
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:12,150
trying to access to any switches

281
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:19,510
yes I'm being told in other sectors in

282
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,270
the areas of the plant and this is

283
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,910
happening somebody's handing and

284
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:42,550
touching switches and you see that the

285
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:46,270
workers not touching anything back shut

286
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:49,180
down speaking about January January last

287
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:52,900
year people started doing research

288
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:57,400
investigating threats were who was

289
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:01,500
behind at one and done it so many

290
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,500
experts around the world go together

291
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:12,790
policing and the army in order to find

292
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:14,890
out would develop that malware attackers

293
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,920
didn't like this and what they did was

294
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:21,010
to learn more they evolved and they make

295
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,440
use they'd already done and they started

296
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:28,800
building upon this and they started

297
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:32,760
using other techniques adding new things

298
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,760
and even

299
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:59,140
launching techniques to fool trick

300
00:19:44,410 --> 00:20:02,770
everybody wanna make we are criminal era

301
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:04,540
T's with previous woman because of the

302
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:07,950
function because of the codes are they

303
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:12,450
used they share the functions

304
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:17,050
functionalities they disguised the code

305
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:24,820
but kept using it in fact it was very

306
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:30,270
funny because we saw systems that had

307
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:39,460
been immune left to the normal attacks

308
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:42,790
with Linux in this in the screen they

309
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:52,200
planted a message saying that your

310
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:55,210
wonderful server had been affected and

311
00:20:52,200 --> 00:21:02,470
get them back you need to pay you have

312
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:08,910
to pay big bitcoins worth ten thousand

313
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:13,540
dollars in 2016

314
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:17,380
asking for two thousand bitcoins in 2016

315
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:21,399
was important and nobody paid but I know

316
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:24,360
of was a distraction you know that

317
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:28,660
because they wanted to do was to change

318
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:31,629
the ways of doing things maybe they

319
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:34,030
wanted to start making money was there

320
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,850
anything behind this and whatever was

321
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,700
behind there's something we found out

322
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:43,109
about

323
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:49,960
honesty is something called petia or

324
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:57,549
petia this code malware was so this year

325
00:21:49,960 --> 00:22:04,379
that sent you a typical message in a

326
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:07,359
very funny way computer was rebooted

327
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:09,158
saying that it was going over the hard

328
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:12,099
disk and when he started processing the

329
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,409
files and something this message problem

330
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:17,559
number one the father cannot be

331
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:23,259
recovered no matter how much will you

332
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:25,719
pay the ransom or whatever the encoding

333
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:28,899
system wasn't good it means that you

334
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:31,599
could recover them second it provided

335
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:34,859
you with an email address in order to

336
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:38,320
get in touch with them something that

337
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:41,019
was destroyed so there was no way to get

338
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,700
in touch with him and third maybe look

339
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:49,179
at the map this happened mainly in

340
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,940
Ukraine the rest of the countries were

341
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:54,009
maybe indirectly some ponies were

342
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,109
affected because their headquarters were

343
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:58,210
in Ukraine and they used the same email

344
00:22:56,109 --> 00:23:12,718
program or software that could be used

345
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:15,519
by attackers as attack vector the main

346
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:18,779
sectors that were victims the finance

347
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:27,639
sector the oil sector and the

348
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:33,779
manufacturing finances this is critical

349
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:38,019
why because of this is the MBA program

350
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:42,089
it's a software that's used massively

351
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:45,320
but by almost all companies in Ukraine

352
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:50,350
petia of you recall the name

353
00:23:45,320 --> 00:24:00,939
at the beginning of June just the

354
00:23:50,350 --> 00:24:04,040
revenue statement the attackers located

355
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:07,310
in faction inferred to be done in

356
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,149
Ukraine they used these servers of this

357
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:12,860
application

358
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:19,130
this is an official if TPT compromised

359
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:24,409
by attackers so they you can see here

360
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:29,030
that was uploaded in the first since the

361
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,620
updating was done automatically the

362
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,620
users didn't suspect anything

363
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:39,949
I said well any application that said

364
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:41,360
download it and install it wasn't the

365
00:24:39,950 --> 00:25:00,890
first time they did this because they

366
00:24:41,360 --> 00:25:08,810
tried before already been successful try

367
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:12,730
out right now this updates updating

368
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:19,600
being stored many companies in Ukraine

369
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:23,720
they succeed you can see how different

370
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,669
companies and their systems affected in

371
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,910
Spain we didn't see much of this in

372
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:30,680
Spain maybe some companies who are

373
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,620
interested in that region and they use

374
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:36,170
this accountant system so very few just

375
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:39,320
for you to see the difference on the

376
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,560
left and you have the Trojan version of

377
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,560
this

378
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,459
[Music]

379
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:53,340
for several hours using Trojan versions

380
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:56,730
that these criminals used let's move to

381
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:59,550
in this Australia which is the most

382
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:02,850
important threat this year and that is

383
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:06,919
oriented to the industrial sector why

384
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,919
apart from my colleague

385
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:19,460
another company dragos we collaborate

386
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:21,169
with because we got many samples from

387
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,929
them at the beginning of the year and we

388
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:27,820
started analyzing the way they worked

389
00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:33,010
and how they could affect an industrial

390
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,010
makes so much sense it's so logical

391
00:27:36,790 --> 00:28:12,770
consent of a control and which is signal

392
00:27:43,520 --> 00:28:17,240
machine or several stop being utilities

393
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:23,960
stops producing electricity the

394
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:33,730
difference the industrial systems or the

395
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:41,030
PLC's have given brands illegitimate

396
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:48,260
commands commercial schema can I try

397
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:52,610
yours so all this you can see you're

398
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:55,220
able to achieve they said to backdoors

399
00:28:52,610 --> 00:29:00,439
they have a main one and a backup one

400
00:28:55,220 --> 00:29:03,140
they use the main one to install there

401
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,790
are more where the question is how

402
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:09,110
although we believe that is

403
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:12,918
electronically and they install a Trojan

404
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:15,799
version of the notepad through the

405
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:19,040
second one that can always be used in

406
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,110
case the main one is discovered they

407
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,350
also install

408
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:25,240
additional tools for example

409
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,030
remote-controlled tools in order to

410
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,610
program an attack for a particular day

411
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:33,580
they can change that day anytime they

412
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,590
want and then to remove all trace

413
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:39,129
whenever they've achieved whatever they

414
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:41,500
wanted to so the change here is the way

415
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:46,990
in which they execute their actions they

416
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:50,620
aren't trying to infect PLC's and they

417
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:53,980
don't seem to want to have remote

418
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:58,750
control they just want to send out

419
00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:03,929
commands that the system interprets as

420
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:07,559
valid for that purpose they use very

421
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:10,120
widely spread protocols in the industry

422
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:15,040
these four protocols the first one is a

423
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:19,030
bit older communication through the

424
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:24,730
serial port with other industry systems

425
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:27,549
so what they are trying to do to see

426
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:29,860
that they are actually executing that

427
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:32,410
there is a process running and what they

428
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:36,309
do is to bring that down and use their

429
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:41,169
own and also your security devices you

430
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:44,080
know two entrances from the

431
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:48,940
communications ports so they are the

432
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:51,178
only one authorized to and establish

433
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:54,790
this communication then there is this

434
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:59,040
104 which is more modern which allows to

435
00:30:54,790 --> 00:31:03,010
send commands through a network with the

436
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:07,030
TCP IP configuration its mooring

437
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:10,629
thorough and it allows to look for files

438
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:13,899
with logs and configurations in order to

439
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:16,600
establish roots to download the commands

440
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,870
there is a problem attached to that

441
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:23,189
protocol because the serial port

442
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:27,639
communication would be local but with

443
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:32,470
104 they can do it remotely actually

444
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:34,630
what they would do wasn't

445
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,460
to a particular system they would look

446
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:41,770
for all the systems in the network

447
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:44,409
through two through two processes range

448
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:47,260
and shift and what they would do was to

449
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:50,289
check them down one by one automatically

450
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:52,690
instead of using the mouse and clicking

451
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:56,110
them out they would look for all the

452
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:57,400
monitored industrial system processes

453
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:02,469
that are controlling different

454
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:04,980
appliances and they off one by one

455
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:09,100
automatically and when this is finished

456
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:11,830
the program is over and this doesn't

457
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:15,010
only affect power plants we are using

458
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:20,439
this in companies and infrastructure

459
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:23,530
services all over the world and they

460
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:26,049
have their own established standards

461
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:28,470
that won't change in the short and

462
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:30,760
midterm so these attacks if used

463
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:33,789
massively can have very serious

464
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:37,240
consequences when they are looking for

465
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:39,669
or what they want is to shut down the

466
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,460
switches so that a particular company

467
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:45,850
cannot supply electricity or provide the

468
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:49,120
service they provide whatever it is but

469
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:54,820
in a more elegant and automatized way

470
00:32:49,120 --> 00:33:01,989
that also leaves less traces and there

471
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:05,230
was this bonus they also did was a

472
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:09,030
service attack against the cyber tech

473
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:13,240
Siemens services or our systems

474
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:16,799
what they did was sending a UDP packet

475
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:21,159
with these characteristics in order to

476
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,289
stop the system from running this is the

477
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:25,360
system that manages communications

478
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:25,929
between the operator and the critical

479
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,590
systems

480
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:32,049
if these fail while people are in deep

481
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,178
trouble so this came as a bonus they

482
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:39,340
didn't they didn't really need to do it

483
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:42,880
but just to add that functionality so

484
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,980
we've talked about attacks in networks

485
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,410
that we use on a daily basis

486
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,799
but these detects use all the vectors

487
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:52,929
you don't need to use a computer or a

488
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,900
hook on the internet looking for

489
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:58,929
vulnerable machines and backdoors there

490
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:03,970
are all the communications that enable

491
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:08,560
attacks to systems that are controlling

492
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:11,199
cities for example signaling devices if

493
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,929
you don't know something there is one of

494
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:18,250
the biggest smart cities in Spain and in

495
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:21,220
Europe and there is a website where you

496
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:26,980
can control the stages of all these

497
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:33,279
sensors regulating bosses or truck trash

498
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:36,340
trucks and also senses that detect

499
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:41,530
faults and failures to be repaired by

500
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:44,200
the City Council there is a conference

501
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:47,470
that you should look at which was how to

502
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:52,000
hack Santander and he he showed some

503
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:54,459
examples proving that these systems were

504
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,560
hackable as well there are many uses for

505
00:34:54,460 --> 00:35:05,170
example we have traffic signs that maybe

506
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:08,940
even funny at some point but the thing

507
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:12,180
gets more serious when you can modify

508
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,380
emergency systems ambulance systems

509
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:19,000
systems that need to work seamlessly

510
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:21,609
when they are needed so if these can be

511
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,619
modified with a software-defined radio

512
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:26,319
system that is a very serious thing

513
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:28,390
Carlos Garcia said it very clearly in

514
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,030
his talk

515
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:34,779
do you have 30 euros you can hack your

516
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:36,700
city so with the right knowledge and

517
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,850
with the right material which isn't

518
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,618
precisely expensive emergency

519
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,190
communication systems and many more

520
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:44,500
things

521
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:47,380
he provided the components this is all

522
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:51,400
you needed if you buy this kind of

523
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:53,619
devices and Aliexpress for instance you

524
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,900
can build the device for less

525
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:59,319
then 30 euros of course you need to have

526
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:02,799
the knowledge but if someone can make

527
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:05,440
this with the right amount of research

528
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:07,839
it is very concerning that no measures

529
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,480
have been taken in order to avoid this

530
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,690
from happening in a larger scale we have

531
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,230
this example from Dallas in May you are

532
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:19,450
hearing our emergency sirens whenever

533
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:23,109
there is an earthquake a flood or a

534
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:25,288
critical situation if I remember

535
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:28,210
correctly there's worse on Saturday or

536
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:31,119
Sunday it was during the weekend people

537
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:33,430
were resting and it's no funny at all

538
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,829
that this siren goes off because it's

539
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:39,160
pretty loud at the same time so what

540
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:42,099
happened someone pushed the button when

541
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,680
they didn't have to no no operators

542
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:47,170
admitted to have pushed the button or

543
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,328
sent the command there is this emergency

544
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,529
where as everything looks very quiet

545
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:57,849
what happened

546
00:36:50,529 --> 00:37:01,239
radio frequency attacks these alarms you

547
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:06,519
can find more about this example and my

548
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:08,230
friends alex Casanova's blog and what

549
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:10,299
can be done there are many more

550
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:14,440
possibilities that aren't being dealt

551
00:37:10,299 --> 00:37:16,599
with and they can be done via radio

552
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,549
frequency you don't even need the

553
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,170
internet in order to attack the systems

554
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:23,890
there are other information protocols

555
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:27,999
that are as effective and they can be

556
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:30,249
very serious because nobody has taken

557
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:33,759
these accounts seriously of or they have

558
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:37,749
underestimated this attacks because

559
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:40,630
people have trusted that security is

560
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:44,019
based on obscurity if nobody knows how

561
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:46,390
this works we are safe this is

562
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:49,140
absolutely false it is very easy to

563
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:54,670
obtain critical information about how

564
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:57,259
critical systems work because somebody

565
00:37:54,670 --> 00:38:01,520
with the right amount of patience

566
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:04,250
can discovers security breaches I can

567
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,160
think of proven Santa Marta for example

568
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:09,710
who is able to find security breaches on

569
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:13,850
critical infrastructures now the

570
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:18,260
question is after seeing all this are we

571
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:20,680
as bad as people say are the media

572
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:23,750
telling the truth or are they

573
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,310
overreacting another question where did

574
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,070
that where do they get that information

575
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:29,720
because here they say Spain is the third

576
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,170
country in the world with more

577
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:36,290
cyberattacks how do they know because

578
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:40,790
there is this report and who are the

579
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:44,180
main tube well the US England and we're

580
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:46,250
his friends here where is Russia this is

581
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:50,089
like the Spanish flu during the world

582
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:57,550
war some countries aren't providing any

583
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:57,550
data and therefore we are escalating the

584
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:06,710
terrible consequences Spain and Spain

585
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:10,790
was providing data about the number of

586
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:13,340
casualties and the flu got the name of

587
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:15,950
Spanish flu and not because there were

588
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:19,250
more casualties in Spain but because

589
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:21,830
Spain was one of the few countries

590
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,690
providing data and this is the same

591
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,880
thing here when it comes to cyber

592
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:28,970
attacks it's true that cyber attacks

593
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:33,590
have increased but the problem isn't

594
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:35,330
only that it's interesting to know that

595
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,550
we are able to detect them more

596
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:39,560
efficiently maybe two years ago we

597
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:43,250
didn't have the tools to detect those

598
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:47,119
attacks so are we that bad should we

599
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:50,750
move to the countryside and dug

600
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,150
ourselves a cave well we have to bear in

601
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:58,540
mind several factors we've mentioned

602
00:39:53,150 --> 00:40:02,450
several examples reflecting attacks to

603
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:06,950
infrastructures that either don't have a

604
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:08,868
good security system or they are

605
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,450
accessed when they don't have to I've

606
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:13,670
been able to visit critical

607
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:17,868
infrastructures for example in nuclear

608
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:24,710
power plant and I and I am relieved to

609
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:26,800
have sing that critical security systems

610
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:29,839
are mechanically controlled and not

611
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,420
electronically controlled so any attack

612
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,630
of this sort could help

613
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:38,180
for example the functioning of a siren

614
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:42,530
for example or a camera or something

615
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:47,629
like that but the rest need actually the

616
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:51,560
actual hand of an operator there are on

617
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:54,230
the other hand data from people like or

618
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,700
companies like IBM that have shown that

619
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,130
the number of cyber attacks have

620
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,140
increased it's true they have increased

621
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,180
but it's true at the same time that we

622
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:05,799
are more efficient when it comes to

623
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:08,118
detecting them we can see here that the

624
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,839
destination countries in terms of

625
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:17,000
cyberattacks are number one the US and

626
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:19,819
very far behind China and Israel then we

627
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,040
have Pakistan and Canada where is Spain

628
00:41:19,819 --> 00:41:29,660
here where are we I can't see Spain

629
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:32,720
anywhere here actually official rankings

630
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:35,598
don't have as in the top 20 countries so

631
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:39,319
we are saved on the side but then you

632
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,020
start wondering where are all these news

633
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:45,859
that we've seen come from well from

634
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:48,140
biased reports that do not gather all

635
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:51,710
the information as our colleagues from

636
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:54,680
Kaspersky reports there are countries

637
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:58,700
which are a lot worse off than we are

638
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:01,430
and an interesting data that I drew from

639
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:05,060
this report is that there is seasonality

640
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:07,730
actually attack is holiday well in

641
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,560
January there are very very few attacks

642
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,829
after Christmas they are not in the mood

643
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:17,230
and if you realize it attacks go up

644
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:21,310
again from July on so think about it

645
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:23,970
they use vacation periods maybe to

646
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:26,230
prepare new attacks or just to relax

647
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:30,390
there's something else that we need to

648
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:34,960
bear in mind in Spain we have mechanisms

649
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:41,129
such as the ones provided by CE NPIC for

650
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:41,130
critical infrastructures that applying

651
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:46,450
measures that look good on paper

652
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:48,640
although they haven't been very widely

653
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:50,649
used in practical terms but they are

654
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,529
being more and more used when I was

655
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:57,369
preparing this presentation yesterday in

656
00:42:53,530 --> 00:43:01,480
Cebu is preparing something new and this

657
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:03,130
is my next point is there a solution for

658
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,240
the soul well there are several

659
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:11,140
scenarios we can use old technology as I

660
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:13,990
said before which is unfeasible today in

661
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:16,690
light of how technology is evolving we

662
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:20,500
need to develop safer and more secure

663
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:22,780
technology and all the one well you can

664
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,810
just pretend there's nothing going on

665
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:28,570
this is not happening to me until it's

666
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:32,020
too late and the problem is already in

667
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:35,859
your house this is the problem we are

668
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:39,430
seeing and that is hidden the media then

669
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:40,270
there is a problem when you go woof I'm

670
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:42,730
so relieved

671
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:45,040
that we weren't attacked but this is not

672
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:47,680
going to last forever because well this

673
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,550
is a piece of news from yesterday in

674
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:55,109
seva is going to launch the distribution

675
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:58,660
of tools that will raise the level of

676
00:43:55,109 --> 00:44:01,930
cybersecurity that's very good it's a

677
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,819
good idea but this really needs to reach

678
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,250
the companies and the critical sectors

679
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,560
that are to apply this and of course

680
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:11,380
these measures need to be applied they

681
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,990
are very nice on paper a lot of people

682
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:18,220
put a lot of effort into developing

683
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:21,850
these tools but if there is no updating

684
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:25,379
process attached and if we start if we

685
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:25,380
don't start changing our mindset

686
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:38,020
how can we these measures from being

687
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:42,390
acquired well legally maybe we might

688
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:50,500
need to legally force companies to

689
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:53,470
provide these security measures but in

690
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:56,290
many cases people just don't have the

691
00:44:53,470 --> 00:45:02,049
resources you know the to make those

692
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:06,270
happen that is on one hand on the other

693
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:08,530
hand is listen to people who are

694
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,140
devoting their time and knowledge in

695
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:14,920
order to discover these vulnerabilities

696
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:17,379
if we don't listen to them or worse if

697
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:21,790
we accuse them of some things they

698
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:24,640
haven't done we will be in deep trouble

699
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:26,980
a lot of people go desperate when they

700
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,109
want to report an incident that is

701
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:32,140
affecting a critical structure for

702
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:37,630
example a water cleaning system when

703
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:39,490
they want to company well they are not

704
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:42,550
listened to or they are directly

705
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:46,868
threatened to be sued so what can we do

706
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:51,310
about this if you or if you know

707
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:52,930
somebody who is aware of this kind of

708
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:56,880
information there are channels to

709
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:59,560
communicate they can use the security

710
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,530
forces for example the technology

711
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:06,759
department of the civil guard or the

712
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:10,420
National Police and many other CEP s

713
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:14,350
that really have in every region in

714
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:18,040
Spain if you want to keep your privacy

715
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:21,040
then speak to a lawyer and have your

716
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:25,259
lawyer communicate to the security

717
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:29,590
forces but we cannot penalize

718
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:32,740
researchers who are working very hard to

719
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:36,609
make safer system moves

720
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:39,970
and discovering breaches breaches that

721
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:44,430
are to be pledged and if we don't

722
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:49,450
protect these people the bad guys will

723
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:53,700
win the game this is going to take a lot

724
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:56,830
of money but the losses that may be

725
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:59,439
generated with this insecurity if the

726
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:03,279
situation continues like that and if

727
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:06,430
cyber criminals can continue attack in

728
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,970
critical systems without any controls

729
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:12,609
then the consequences are a lot more and

730
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:15,609
we're not just talking about not having

731
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:18,609
heating in December in Ukraine we can

732
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:20,830
have critical systems falling down for

733
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:24,040
example hospital related systems that is

734
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:27,339
very serious and we really need to lobby

735
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:31,000
so that the necessary resources are

736
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:33,609
invested not only in Spain but on a

737
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,680
world scale because many times we're

738
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:38,410
interconnected and the energy we are

739
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:41,140
actually using today isn't maybe coming

740
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:45,759
from Spain but from Algeria for example

741
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:48,879
so if you have questions I know this is

742
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,400
a very peculiar issue and this is

743
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:54,700
probably the first time you've heard

744
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:58,500
about it maybe not a lot of people who

745
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:03,299
are listening to us from the streaming

746
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:05,800
Soares are maybe having questions also

747
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:08,200
please feel free to make to ask any

748
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:14,349
questions you want and use the

749
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:16,529
microphones hello I've loved your

750
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,530
presentation

751
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:29,729
solutions from professionals I think the

752
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:37,859
current government in Spain isn't

753
00:48:29,729 --> 00:48:41,669
thinking like that because there's I've

754
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:43,098
heard this piece of news saying that the

755
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:47,849
government is trying to recruit

756
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:49,109
volunteers to act as reservists what do

757
00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:52,079
you think about this

758
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:55,440
the problem is huge and how is the

759
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,660
Spanish government reacting well what

760
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,880
has been said about that piece of news

761
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:02,879
isn't totally right they are looking for

762
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,999
cyber reservists a lot of people here

763
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,950
can actually talk about this a lot

764
00:49:05,999 --> 00:49:10,680
better than me for example Enrique Avila

765
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:16,769
will speak about it but what they are

766
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:21,960
trying is to to enlarge theirs recipes

767
00:49:16,769 --> 00:49:26,669
school that already exists but the way

768
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:27,719
they put it wasn't wasn't right if you

769
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,930
are a rest

770
00:49:27,719 --> 00:49:34,380
you don't perceive a salary you get paid

771
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:38,390
whenever you provide service I think

772
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:41,579
what they were trying to say is that

773
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:50,190
we're going to be paid only when you

774
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:53,519
were active not concerned about what I'm

775
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:59,160
concerned is who has the right aptitudes

776
00:49:53,519 --> 00:50:03,569
to work as a racist and who can and if

777
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:08,788
someone can launch attacks saying that

778
00:50:03,569 --> 00:50:12,210
they were acting on behalf of the

779
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:14,249
government it's good that people who are

780
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:19,559
providing services for the governments

781
00:50:14,249 --> 00:50:23,339
are adequately paid that's okay in Spain

782
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:25,319
we don't like talent in Spain is that we

783
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:29,130
export the challenge because companies

784
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:30,719
here don't enough for the talent that

785
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,950
were generated that's why people go

786
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,990
abroad

787
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,759
people who were trained here are very

788
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:38,669
good if you take a look at national

789
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,550
international conferences you can see

790
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:46,380
that Spanish speakers are always the

791
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:49,230
best rated so it's not a matter of lack

792
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,430
of talent and this happens also with the

793
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:55,260
Cyber Reserve how does this work do you

794
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:59,430
have to take a test do you need a hacker

795
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:02,119
ID well a lot could be debated around

796
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:06,299
this but my point of view is this people

797
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:10,170
who act as rest of us need to be capable

798
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:12,089
and have the knowledge they have - it

799
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:14,220
has to be very clearly defined what they

800
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:17,190
can do and what they cannot do and they

801
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:20,009
have to be adequately paid yes they have

802
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:23,250
to be valued I believe that the

803
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:26,220
government isn't valuing these people

804
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:28,890
who are computing professionals who've

805
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:32,310
invested millions of hours and they

806
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:36,589
don't feel they are rewarded absolutely

807
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:36,589
you're totally right that is the problem

808
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:46,290
has to say out loud that those millions

809
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:49,529
of hours don't come out of nowhere it's

810
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:52,859
a lot of people's time and those people

811
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:56,520
are willing to give all that effort the

812
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:58,549
wave in case of an emergency but at the

813
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:01,980
same time they want to be rewarded for

814
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:04,829
it if people in the military are being

815
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:06,720
paid for defending Spain these people

816
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:12,109
should be paid as well the problem here

817
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,109
lies in communication and this isn't new

818
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:19,109
because for example a few months ago

819
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:20,940
this piece of news appeared saying are

820
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:23,400
these the hackers that are going to

821
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:26,730
defend Spain and that raised a lot of

822
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,859
controversy it is a very complex issue

823
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:31,490
that's why I don't understand that they

824
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:36,119
are so ambiguous that's the way things

825
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:38,899
go and not only for our field for many

826
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,900
others too

827
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:45,240
pero como o solvin un poquito mas at

828
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,530
rasa Mira

829
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:54,029
so now going back to the beginning of

830
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:54,030
your presentation somebody or a group

831
00:52:54,060 --> 00:53:04,170
installed but more were update into an

832
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:07,390
application that is used for example

833
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:11,230
this controlled well you have given

834
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:17,589
yourself the answer in this case they

835
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:20,560
access public FTP but their security

836
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:23,190
measures were reached and what they did

837
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:26,350
was to modify that application to

838
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:31,930
include a file that wasn't originally

839
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:36,190
there after they did that people would

840
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:41,710
just download the date and as a result

841
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:43,660
their machines were infected so in this

842
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:46,900
case they were looking for more direct

843
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:50,520
attacks for example ransomware spyware

844
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:55,110
etc so there was a configuration breach

845
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:58,150
on the part of the software development

846
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:00,700
company when it comes to defining who

847
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:06,490
and what can be introduced in updates

848
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:10,109
and also another failure that involves

849
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:13,649
the fact that the downloads of updates

850
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:13,650
wasn't controlled

851
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:27,009
one of the essay in the middle good

852
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:29,890
morning first of all I want to thank you

853
00:54:27,009 --> 00:54:31,809
for your very clear presentation

854
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:33,999
everyone was able to understand what you

855
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:36,700
were saying first of all I would like to

856
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:39,759
make comments about what you've said and

857
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:42,609
the questions the comment is and most of

858
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:45,519
the cases you've shared the problem is

859
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:47,529
that people don't use computers for what

860
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,470
they are and they don't have enough

861
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:52,869
training as a result most vulnerable

862
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:56,738
''tis are related to that but it was

863
00:54:52,869 --> 00:54:59,589
just my comment and the question is when

864
00:54:56,739 --> 00:55:04,930
it comes to Internet of Things well I'm

865
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:07,479
quite scared of this kind of thing we

866
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,700
have light bulbs that can be controlled

867
00:55:07,479 --> 00:55:11,379
from the internet coffee machines it can

868
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,529
be controlled from the internet I don't

869
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:16,539
think that the security of this kind of

870
00:55:14,529 --> 00:55:18,519
elements is very high I would like to

871
00:55:16,539 --> 00:55:22,089
know what your opinion is of course

872
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:25,229
unfortunately you are right most of the

873
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:28,420
Internet of Things devices don't have

874
00:55:25,229 --> 00:55:33,339
security as one of their it is one

875
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:35,739
because that delays development and they

876
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:40,869
can it can take longer to launch a new

877
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:43,650
problem to the markets and this is

878
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:47,259
something that we can see very clearly

879
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:50,940
we have more and more devices of this

880
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:56,739
sort connected and that would enable

881
00:55:50,940 --> 00:56:00,819
criminals to do that kind of thing for

882
00:55:56,739 --> 00:56:05,499
example last year a lot of deos attacks

883
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:08,440
were launched and caused failures in

884
00:56:05,499 --> 00:56:12,009
systems such as Spotify Twitter and many

885
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:16,210
more if we multiply this by the millions

886
00:56:12,009 --> 00:56:19,390
of devices vulnerable devices we have we

887
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:22,719
have we can be in a lot of trouble well

888
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:24,999
we as consumers can also say I'm not

889
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,670
buying this thing because it's not

890
00:56:24,999 --> 00:56:28,799
secure

891
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:32,880
and on the other hand we can also

892
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:42,540
promote regulations from the public

893
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:45,200
powers to our Telegraph es puto first of

894
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,670
all thank you for this very thorough

895
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:50,430
presentation that you've prepared I'm

896
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,020
sure that you've put a lot of work into

897
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:56,339
it

898
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:59,160
I'm a teenager I'm still learning and I

899
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:03,630
think I have a long way to go to reach

900
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:06,299
where you are well there are a lot of

901
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:13,400
people who know a lot more than me well

902
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:16,440
my question is would you recommend

903
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,740
teenagers like me to work in

904
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:26,040
cybersecurity do you think this is a

905
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:28,229
viable option for future my second

906
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:31,770
question is what kind of training should

907
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:32,870
we undertake in order to be experts in

908
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:36,870
cybersecurity

909
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:38,970
well cybersecurity is not a future

910
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:41,490
career it is a present career

911
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:43,500
we need people and the problem is in

912
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:45,029
Spain as I said is that a lot of people

913
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:49,260
leave because companies here don't pay

914
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:51,330
enough and yes absolutely you have to

915
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:53,700
love it of course this is something that

916
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:55,350
you learn every day it's not something

917
00:57:53,700 --> 00:58:01,399
that you study and then you forget about

918
00:57:55,350 --> 00:58:05,220
it actually the train today just gives

919
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:08,640
you basic pillars very general

920
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:12,870
fundamentals so that you can specialize

921
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:17,879
with masters cost courses etc but what

922
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:20,750
is crucial here is the practice studying

923
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:24,230
only isn't enough you need to be curious

924
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:27,480
you must be interested in knowing how

925
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:30,600
the systems work in order to find

926
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:32,250
security breaches doing things like the

927
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,440
ones you're doing today

928
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:36,780
attending conferences I have I do here a

929
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:40,860
friend of mine who is a vocational

930
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:44,160
education teacher and he fosters this

931
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:48,600
among his students he even organizes

932
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:50,850
cyber Olympics you have more chances

933
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:53,569
than we did back at the time because you

934
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:56,700
have thousands of tutorial humans

935
00:58:53,570 --> 00:59:00,150
practical possibilities here at cyber

936
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:01,980
camp you have the option of testing your

937
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:04,410
abilities and a lot of companies are

938
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:07,110
looking for this kind of channel talent

939
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:12,000
so take advantage of all the resources

940
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:15,390
you have be curious provides results of

941
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,760
your investigations and research to the

942
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:22,799
community etc but an important piece of

943
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:27,600
advice try not to cross the line that

944
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:30,120
divides hackers from criminals hackers

945
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:34,049
aren't criminals they are researchers

946
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:37,529
who look for holes the ones that cross

947
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:38,610
the line and use those holes for their

948
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:40,710
own interest

949
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:43,470
those are criminals and that is

950
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:47,100
difficult because there are a lot of ego

951
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:52,230
problems here but I encourage you to

952
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:55,080
study things and the courses and masters

953
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:59,190
related to computer practice but

954
00:59:55,080 --> 01:00:03,080
practice practice and and continuous

955
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:03,080
learning is vital in this profession

956
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:12,270
well you've said that practice is what

957
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:14,130
we need but how can we take the theory

958
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:19,230
that we learn in the books to the

959
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:22,890
practical field it's very easy medium is

960
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:26,130
more how to take the theory to the

961
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:28,560
practice you have many instruments many

962
01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:32,160
tools that allow you to practice at home

963
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:34,440
by generating scenarios and systems

964
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,270
there are many of them most of them are

965
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:41,180
for free and you have

966
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:44,270
virtual machines flash captures many

967
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:47,060
different things that can put your

968
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:50,210
knowledge to the test and this guy over

969
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,740
here can help you do that thank you very

970
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:56,160
much

971
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:56,160
[Applause]
