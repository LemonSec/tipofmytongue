1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,210
good afternoon everybody how are you

2
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:29,489
it's cold here in Santander but oh well

3
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,710
let's see what we can do this afternoon

4
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:34,500
I've already been introduced my name is

5
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:40,550
emmanuel la guerra I now work for the

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:43,890
technological central investigation unit

7
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:51,080
further police Spanish police force we

8
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:56,400
in our unit are in charge of pursuing

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:58,650
persecuting all sort of criminal

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,909
activities carried out through new

11
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:05,459
technologies while selling children's

12
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:12,450
pornography through the internet fraud

13
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:17,758
in general for instance fraudulent sales

14
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:22,800
of houses for instance cars and also

15
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:27,540
computer attacks and hacking and in

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:31,350
piracy so all these crimes are the ones

17
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:42,000
that are investigated by our unit but

18
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:46,048
more specifically I work in a department

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,920
called the technical section and we

20
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:53,150
don't carry out normal sort of

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:56,880
investigations we provide a forensic

22
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:00,619
analysis support in the case of crime I

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:05,130
always repeat this because right

24
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:10,400
nowadays any crime present in the

25
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:14,750
Spanish criminal code includes some

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:21,390
technological component for instance a

27
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:23,629
drug-dealing crime is there's nothing

28
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,859
digital to it theoretically speaking

29
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:28,849
somebody is selling their drugs but

30
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,730
there is a cellphone involved

31
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:35,420
between the dealer and whoever buys the

32
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,780
drug this is digital evidence that needs

33
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,358
to be processed in order to get all the

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:46,700
information maybe that may be useful in

35
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:49,599
a trial and this cannot be done just any

36
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,849
way it has to be done through a

37
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,730
procedure through a protocol a murder

38
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:59,629
where there's been a camera involved and

39
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:04,399
where evidence is stored and this is

40
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:08,048
what we deal with mainly but going back

41
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,719
in time and going to the past if we

42
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:15,049
think of a situation 10-15 years ago

43
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:21,310
for instance when we went into a house

44
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:24,409
and searched a house maybe we just found

45
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:27,500
a cellphone but know what's up no

46
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,879
Facebook or even computers than 15 years

47
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,639
ago

48
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,540
you must think was sort of computers you

49
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:39,009
had 10 or 15 years ago in your house the

50
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:45,310
your lucky view had one and pendrives

51
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:52,009
maybe 500 Megas capacity

52
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:54,709
nobody has such poor capacity pendrives

53
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:58,159
and the same applies to companies what

54
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,019
happened 10 15 years ago in companies

55
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,509
when winter companies that have been

56
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:04,310
involved in money laundering for

57
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:07,458
instance what did we find

58
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,650
when searching his paper paper the only

59
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:14,120
technology we could find in a company or

60
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:16,789
an office was the coffee machine now

61
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,739
when we go into a house what do we

62
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:26,380
normally find when at least we find five

63
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:29,929
or six cell phones mother's phone

64
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:34,210
father's phone father

65
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:37,190
second phone his wife doesn't know about

66
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,758
so lots of evidence lots of evidence

67
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:44,000
that needs to be checked and processed

68
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,940
when we get to a house the bad guy will

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,060
never say yes look in that cupboard and

70
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:53,270
see what you find so we need to look

71
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,930
into all these devices and gadgets in

72
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,900
order to find evidence and then other

73
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:04,430
technology things for instance of rather

74
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:07,159
in order to go into the Internet

75
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,830
when there's a Wi-Fi and this is just a

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:17,240
mini computer that manages the internet

77
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:22,070
with Wi-Fi it may store MAC addresses or

78
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:26,590
an ass 10-15 years ago you didn't think

79
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:29,690
that somebody would have high capacity

80
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,090
storage system at home and right now

81
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:35,030
having this in the house is more or less

82
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,570
normal I mean it's not something that we

83
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:42,039
are surprised with and now come all the

84
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:49,310
gadgets for instance smart some sort of

85
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:52,760
SmartWatch that can be connected your

86
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:59,419
iPhone or Android wherever you want to

87
00:05:52,760 --> 00:06:04,000
know your heart beats rate who does have

88
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:08,299
a SmartWatch raise your hands so

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,280
SmartWatch is a digital evidence let's

90
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:16,009
imagine that all of a sudden a there's a

91
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:19,520
you see a dead person lying on the floor

92
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:22,310
with a smut watch wearing a SmartWatch

93
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:27,849
you can tell when this person died

94
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:33,970
because if this person was wearing a

95
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:37,150
SmartWatch obviously when his

96
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:40,840
stopped beating this would be reflected

97
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:44,289
than the SmartWatch so you can get lots

98
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:49,750
of information from a watch and also

99
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:54,130
Smart TVs sitting at home and I can go

100
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:58,210
in the net and this mode TV probably has

101
00:06:54,130 --> 00:07:01,420
a webcam and maybe somebody is attacted

102
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:06,120
and has activated it remotely and has

103
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:09,910
recorded me on a Saturday night at home

104
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,940
lying on my couch and perhaps I don't

105
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:15,580
want anybody of you to know what I was

106
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:20,650
doing lying on a couch in front of a TV

107
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:25,140
on a Saturday night and so we need to

108
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:29,950
know who breached my privacy the

109
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:31,900
refrigerator fridge I'm at home I drink

110
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:39,719
milk and all of a sudden I run out of

111
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:43,650
milk and the fridge can purchase or buy

112
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:46,500
carton of milk and have the milk

113
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:52,359
delivered in my house the next morning

114
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:56,770
because knows what my credit card number

115
00:07:52,360 --> 00:08:02,010
is and of course a hacker somebody can

116
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:06,940
go into my fridge or find out what my

117
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:10,120
credit card number is of course like

118
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,710
intelligent or smart mirrors of course

119
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,570
anybody would like to get up in the

120
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,359
morning and sitting in front of the

121
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,800
mirror and have the mirror say - you

122
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,520
look wonderful

123
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:29,470
today so the designer decided to have

124
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:33,520
SSH without any security or weather

125
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:37,300
default sort of a cute add mint one two

126
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,990
three four or something very easy so

127
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:44,019
that somebody could

128
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:46,570
connected to the bathroom mirror imagine

129
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:55,330
what could happen if somebody does so

130
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:58,570
your bathroom so imagine how complex

131
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,720
things and must can become so any sort

132
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,829
of devices got to have this

133
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,339
technological component so we work in

134
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:09,819
for instance

135
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:14,200
searches in houses or companies or

136
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:17,769
offices to get information when it is

137
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,950
fresh information what information want

138
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:24,510
information so what do we need to do

139
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,160
when we first arrive in the city in the

140
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,350
house of somebody it was the first thing

141
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,240
one must do what's the first thing what

142
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:34,209
do you think is the first thing we must

143
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,329
do when break into a house now before

144
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:40,750
cloning what's the first thing we must

145
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:42,609
do well you must not knock on the door

146
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,360
or ring the bell yes

147
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:49,240
first we need to get in how can we do

148
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,540
this if we haven't walked into the house

149
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,890
to begin with so if you're if we're

150
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:59,920
dressed as a policeman and knock on the

151
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,870
door maybe the Uglies will destroy

152
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,209
everything they have in the house all

153
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,450
the evidence where this doesn't always

154
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:10,300
happen but depending on how nasty the

155
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,390
guy is or how smart maybe he or she will

156
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:19,270
destroy the evidence so we need to go in

157
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:24,640
quickly all of the fireworks and

158
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:28,660
everything but since we are legal police

159
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,930
the government provides us with a series

160
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:36,790
of elements that allows us to break into

161
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:39,219
a house in an easy manner such as we

162
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:43,839
have a master key we have a master key

163
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:46,300
and this is compatible with most locks

164
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,060
that you see in

165
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,120
houses so this allows us to walk into a

166
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:53,979
house even if a person inside doesn't

167
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,420
open the door and this is what this

168
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:02,260
master key looks like hemp weighs 20

169
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:04,630
kilos of reinforced concrete and it's a

170
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:12,400
compatible with any luck whatsoever you

171
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:17,050
may find in this country I'm going to

172
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,840
run a short video clip yes cloning and

173
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,930
hash and this and that and but have you

174
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,210
gone to a house if you don't break into

175
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,489
your house properly you won't be able to

176
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:35,980
do anything so I'm going to show you

177
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:37,390
this small video clip now this wasn't it

178
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,290
just a second

179
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,290
allow me

180
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:56,270
yeah well the master key they trying to

181
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,270
open the door

182
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,180
of course people inside him when I

183
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:09,800
opened the doors my colleague needs to

184
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:09,800
break in through the terrace

185
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:32,160
well the halberd a gun everything a lot

186
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:45,840
of weights this is a real thing you know

187
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:50,010
this is a drug-dealing bust what was

188
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:52,500
happening then well in the house all the

189
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,330
drugs were hidden and every time they'd

190
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,940
hit the door with a master key

191
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:59,220
they had burnt all the drugs inside

192
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,190
every minute went by there were

193
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:06,120
destroying drugs so our job has to do

194
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:09,230
with preventing this from happening

195
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,470
this happens with drug dealing that is

196
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:17,450
analodjica sort of crimes no digital

197
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:20,400
component to begin with or in theory

198
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,410
just a chunk or a hashish or whatever

199
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,540
but what happens what's happening

200
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:27,600
nowadays that is when we break into a

201
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:31,020
house we found a hard disk inside the

202
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,540
fireplace and for perhaps it's the month

203
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,990
of July and in July there's not that

204
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,140
cold

205
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,390
really imageries why should a fireplace

206
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,939
be going

207
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:45,330
sim that was happening with drugs and

208
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:49,200
now they do it with a hard disks simply

209
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:54,240
burned them at CD you know a hard disk

210
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:57,740
and of course it was a charge with cell

211
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:03,600
phones mobile phones this is all wore

212
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:16,340
with a hole ventilation and they threw

213
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:16,340
the mobile phone the this ventilation

214
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,779
this is the first thing we need to do in

215
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:26,970
order to analyze evidence we need to

216
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,970
find it to begin with or else there's no

217
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,730
investigating the evidence we need to

218
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:36,660
find it there is no evidence there's

219
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,660
nothing

220
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:46,630
maybe with machine learning we'll get

221
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:49,449
there but not yet so now that we broke

222
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,459
in we've been able to look at that

223
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:54,219
evidence that cell phone that pendrive

224
00:14:51,459 --> 00:15:00,699
the hard disk now what now what

225
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:03,389
obviously we need to process it right

226
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:07,930
way in order to try and bring this

227
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:12,040
information before to a judge and that

228
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:19,709
are a job to bring this evidence to a

229
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:22,420
judge mobile telephony mobile phones

230
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:24,459
analyzing mobile phones whatever the

231
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,750
model is it doesn't matter the first

232
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:32,138
thing is first thing is to get the phone

233
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,540
and by getting the acquiring the phone

234
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:39,069
I'm not referring to purchasing or

235
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,610
buying the phone or acquiring the hard

236
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:43,599
disk

237
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:51,209
people think that we buy the hard disk

238
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:56,110
from the thieves or the criminals not by

239
00:15:51,209 --> 00:16:03,250
acquiring evidence we refer to capturing

240
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:05,759
it and we use automated devices such as

241
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:10,240
the one you see on the screen this is

242
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,810
Kelowna or a cloning device the others

243
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,240
we used to have a hard disk cloning

244
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:20,859
machines and right now we have this for

245
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:25,420
mobile phones we connect the cell phone

246
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,200
and it produces an image or replicates

247
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:31,370
an image of that

248
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:34,730
a mirror of the mirrors whatever's

249
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:39,250
inside the phone so these are machines

250
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:43,610
that somebody's programmed for given aim

251
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:45,950
so if we want to get information from

252
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:48,560
the cell phone and if the machine hasn't

253
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,200
been appropriate for this so if the

254
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,030
machine doesn't include the action or

255
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,330
whatever it is we wanted to do

256
00:16:53,030 --> 00:17:01,750
then nothing so this is where the work

257
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:04,930
of the forensic analysts comes in place

258
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:07,339
obviously we are this is like

259
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,530
craftsmanship it's not like a piece of

260
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:12,698
furniture you have at home that's been

261
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:17,709
done in a factory this is different from

262
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:25,150
a piece of furniture has been done by

263
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:28,960
somebody who works would a craftsman

264
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:35,930
obviously it's not the same to do

265
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:39,230
automated data extraction from a machine

266
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:41,000
then if we do it by hand I'm going to

267
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,890
show you an example give you an example

268
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,510
in order to illustrate this and I'm

269
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:58,490
going to be using the example of what's

270
00:17:44,510 --> 00:18:00,350
up this is data base viewer or reader a

271
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:05,450
mystery story Punto Devane there was up

272
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:09,740
this is all the messages we sent via

273
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:16,400
whatsapp stored in a database that is

274
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:19,940
called energy as something stored and MS

275
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,370
GSS store so these data are taken out in

276
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,850
order for the analyst to check them but

277
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:29,659
what if we need to find something that

278
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:34,719
the automatic machine can't find then we

279
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:37,380
need to pull it out of the database

280
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,690
and for instance of the there was the

281
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,800
example of mobile phone had been sending

282
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:47,920
what's up and the person manipulating it

283
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,310
wasn't touching or didn't have the cell

284
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,280
phone in his hand it's like if you have

285
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:57,820
this phone over on sitting on the table

286
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:01,350
and on the table and nobody's touching

287
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:09,700
it but it's sending out what's up

288
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:15,419
automatically so some weeks ago some

289
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,420
weeks before we investigated this

290
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:23,560
whatsapp web had just come out a few

291
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:29,440
weeks before so somebody was sending

292
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:37,020
what's ups from a computer if you see

293
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:37,020
this and this on this column right here

294
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:44,580
detail there's the thing I'm

295
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:48,130
highlighting in green if we select it

296
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:51,010
you see that these three cells this one

297
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:54,480
and the one underneath they all begin

298
00:19:51,010 --> 00:20:02,400
with three eb0

299
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:05,500
so what's up inserted this 3 eb 0 code

300
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,760
every time somebody sent a watch shop

301
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:14,020
through whatsapp web unlike regular

302
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,800
what's up but if i send it with whatsapp

303
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:24,430
web link to the telephone it will insert

304
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:27,940
this clue this key fine when what's up

305
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:31,390
web nobody knew so we had to do all this

306
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:38,620
reverse engineering in order to see what

307
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:44,820
sort of password this what's up

308
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:44,820
web carried whether in this case is is 3

309
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:56,020
EB zero saying you may tell me what you

310
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:58,270
said perhaps the conversation could have

311
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:04,470
been manipulated somebody people asked

312
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:10,840
us this yes manipulating database

313
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:19,380
circulate is not easy so I need a series

314
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:22,240
of conditions need to be the

315
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:26,610
manipulating conversations such as the

316
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,610
one you can see here will leave traces

317
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,649
leave a trail and this does you can tell

318
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,720
whether database has been manipulated or

319
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:37,959
not for instance when I was a kid I was

320
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,659
in school I was given a netbook a paper

321
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,059
notebook and the teacher would write

322
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:46,059
down a number on each a page from one to

323
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:49,928
a hundred why where because maybe when

324
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:52,740
they started throwing pieces of chalk or

325
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:57,010
playing around with other kids

326
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:59,710
the teacher would write a note for my

327
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:06,640
parents on my notebook saying that I

328
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:10,380
hadn't behaved so this is why they were

329
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:15,399
numbered because I could I could have

330
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:17,559
ripped out a page of the notebook and

331
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:21,039
the same thing here if we go to this

332
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:26,049
little bar here we see that the rule

333
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:28,870
numbered 1 2 3 4 5 6 maybe we could

334
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:31,600
manipulate the contents of a message but

335
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,729
we cannot inject or put in a

336
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,309
conversation that never took place

337
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:41,020
and this is extremely complex because

338
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:43,149
there are many variables at play so it's

339
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,830
not easy to manipulate a what's up

340
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:46,830
conversations not easy at all

341
00:22:49,830 --> 00:23:02,740
so if you want to know what's up what's

342
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:08,230
up what's up work next Saturday I will

343
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:15,010
be given a two hour workshop on what's

344
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:17,590
up autopsy if you're forensic analysts I

345
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:21,580
recommend you to attend because I'll

346
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:24,629
tell you how what's up works and about

347
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:27,790
all these tricks we're going back to the

348
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:31,330
beginning of a talk there's a whole set

349
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:36,760
of mobile devices so what do we do with

350
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:43,000
all these things let's go to PCs when we

351
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:48,760
need to extract get information from PC

352
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:51,070
we see multimedia videos Word documents

353
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,050
we don't do an analysis to see if

354
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:56,679
there's been some sort of a malware or

355
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:59,290
how many times has been on or off so

356
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:04,090
when filtering filtering these data is

357
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:06,850
enough this sounds silly very simple

358
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:11,530
that many forensic analysis can be done

359
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:14,669
simply by filtering documents by

360
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:21,190
extension but when things become

361
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:23,020
complicated we study information coming

362
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:27,780
from the system instance all the

363
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:31,950
different sites or hits to given a site

364
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:35,560
but doing analysis of artifacts of a

365
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:38,260
regular normal computer could take us

366
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,669
here to for instance eighty-nine

367
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:44,490
thousand items in just one computer

368
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:47,710
eighty-nine thousand computers or

369
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:51,420
documents or items that somebody has to

370
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:55,200
analyze and this is where

371
00:24:51,420 --> 00:25:00,170
the difficult thing is the problem is to

372
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,170
analyze all this information and to tell

373
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:11,370
the weak from the shed the problem is to

374
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:14,010
analyze all this information oh there's

375
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:17,909
another problem and the first forensic

376
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:20,580
analysis in the cloud you may think that

377
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:24,150
I may have a confidential information in

378
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,770
my laptop but have you taken away and

379
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,120
you try and analyze that perhaps you'll

380
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,370
find that there's nothing in it

381
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,879
why because everything's in the cloud in

382
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:36,030
Drive and Gmail whatever Facebook

383
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,110
Twitter or the pictures everything but

384
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:43,379
in the computer there's nothing the

385
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:45,600
operating system etc and more and more

386
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:53,690
we find computers like these it's a

387
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:57,809
basic computer engine etc etc

388
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:02,960
everything's in the cloud and accessing

389
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:02,960
the cloud is a very difficult thing

390
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,178
because series are very complex tasks

391
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:20,668
must be carried out in order to be able

392
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:24,990
to go and we have to face every day and

393
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:27,690
then companies companies what I said at

394
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,820
the beginning that 10 years ago if you

395
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,580
broke into a company or what is your

396
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:37,020
company there were piles of paper right

397
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:39,330
now their servers CPD's large data

398
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:44,000
centers and that's not paper it's a

399
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:51,418
whole bunch of boxes with many LEDs

400
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:56,410
lights that make noise so if we need to

401
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:59,560
break and to

402
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:01,990
get some servers you put some tape

403
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,200
around the door and nobody walks in

404
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:10,660
looks very nice for the picture it looks

405
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:15,000
so great but a server in data processing

406
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:18,120
center doesn't matter every seal if you

407
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:26,470
put all this tape around the door

408
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:31,500
because anybody can break in remotely do

409
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:31,500
we need to do so obviously we need to

410
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,220
determine what sort of network topology

411
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:42,490
we are speaking of what I mean by this

412
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:51,100
we need to know where every why is a hot

413
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:53,230
tip you see a yellow the top orange and

414
00:27:51,100 --> 00:28:00,159
this is what we normally find this is

415
00:27:53,230 --> 00:28:04,300
what we have to face it is looking like

416
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:07,030
this this is reality the other thing was

417
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:14,980
a pretty picture we need to know where

418
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:20,250
the router is the cetera whoever set it

419
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:20,250
up it is extremely difficult to go in

420
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:27,220
using the master key I showed you before

421
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:29,680
we can actually violate a security door

422
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:32,200
of this CPD but the logical security is

423
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:36,670
more complicated if it has firewalls or

424
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:39,970
encoded systems etc then the hypervisors

425
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:43,420
that they can use in the past each

426
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:46,690
server had one OS H now they are all

427
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:49,540
almost virtual sigh tricks is not the

428
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:52,570
same as hyper-v or any other brand they

429
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,760
don't work the same way and we need to

430
00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:00,750
know how each of them works in order to

431
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:03,879
extract the information we need we

432
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,800
cannot lose all the information that we

433
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,590
virtually have just because someone

434
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:12,970
pushed a button

435
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:14,620
the W a and the Internet it is risk to

436
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:16,420
leave things connected to the Internet

437
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,580
but to disconnect is also a risk

438
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:22,090
something we need to take into account

439
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:24,939
what about the backup systems sometimes

440
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:27,939
people say you have everything you want

441
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:31,180
everything you ask for is in this backup

442
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,010
tape now there is no human way possible

443
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:37,150
to read it because nobody's touched it

444
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:40,210
for 20 years that is impossible that is

445
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:44,020
unfeasible this is the kind of thing

446
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:46,780
that we cannot accept today you cannot

447
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:50,950
bring us a backup tape that is

448
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:53,710
unreadable nowadays so all these

449
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:55,930
complications together make things very

450
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,270
hard and then there is a famous red

451
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:01,450
button who's heard of the red button

452
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:05,350
before please raise your hand who's ever

453
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:07,900
seen a red button in reality have you

454
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:11,020
ever seen a red button in reality ever

455
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:15,160
in your life in either I've never seen

456
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:17,560
such a button we hear about it from the

457
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,690
media that the bad guys have a red

458
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,360
button when they push it the hell is

459
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:25,440
coming fire flames everywhere I've never

460
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,780
seen it but what I've seen many times is

461
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,950
remote administration systems in a data

462
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:39,040
center the administrator is not in front

463
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:40,960
of the server with the scorching heat if

464
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,720
you've ever been into a data center you

465
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,240
will know that is not pleasant to be

466
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,310
there the administrator is sitting in

467
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,430
his wonderful chair with five different

468
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:53,679
screen wonderful keyboard and a coffee

469
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,350
machine next to him a comfortable place

470
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:01,270
and they connect to the server remotely

471
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:03,370
in whichever way has been enabled that's

472
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,590
what we need it doesn't matter if we go

473
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,860
to the data center we tape it all around

474
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,949
if the administrator is five floors

475
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:14,209
above us and is constantly deleting

476
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:17,840
files this

477
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:19,910
kind of details need to be considered so

478
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,689
there are no red buttons but there are

479
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:27,800
security measures in data centers what

480
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:31,000
is weird in this picture you rabbits

481
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:34,250
please don't speak you know but the rest

482
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,800
what Josep you not entitled to speak

483
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:39,650
here but what do you see here what is

484
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:47,690
weird about this picture the box yeah

485
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:52,490
what is in the box don't stay there what

486
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:55,580
is that box but black well you cannot

487
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:59,450
see it but this black thing on the left

488
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:06,740
is a 12 volt battery that is inside this

489
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:11,210
white box inside the white box a

490
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,810
pressure switch this was covered by a

491
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,040
plate

492
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:18,860
when this plate is uncovered the circuit

493
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:22,879
places the pushes goes off and twelve

494
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:25,399
bolts of power go to the hard-disk and

495
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,700
what happens in this case

496
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:32,390
well the hard-disk won't go faster at

497
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:38,320
least that what happens is more similar

498
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:40,760
to fireworks so we have a top-notch

499
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,990
security and Technology a device which

500
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:49,340
is a piece of rope that we would use to

501
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:52,580
manipulate and avoid this trap from

502
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,959
happening so this is what it was all

503
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,490
about when someone would remove the

504
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,520
plate this is what happened

505
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:00,460
these look like small things but these

506
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,350
small things can ruin an entire

507
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,930
operation this is what I was saying

508
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,760
before the law is with us and I'm

509
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:11,930
serious now

510
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:15,280
the Spanish criminal law says that

511
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:19,280
system administrators in a company are

512
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,050
forced to collaborate with judges or

513
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,810
police forces in order to provide

514
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:25,899
information regarding the system network

515
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,629
topology and all the things I

516
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:31,510
talked about and when I talk about the

517
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:36,790
system administrator I mean the person

518
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:40,629
who is actually working in house I'm not

519
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:44,470
talking about researchers so this is

520
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:49,540
what we usually call an administrator a

521
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:52,240
system administrator well the system

522
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:53,320
administrator can refuse to speak then

523
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,480
we arrest him

524
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,210
but we don't have the password so we

525
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:03,090
cannot go in so there are other more

526
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:07,510
traditional ways in order to obtain

527
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:11,009
passwords for vaults for lockers etc

528
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:15,639
this is very very secret but take a look

529
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:18,340
it is about going beyond maybe we are

530
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,440
burning our brains here trying to obtain

531
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:25,810
a password and sometimes it's just

532
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:31,139
sticked on the screen this is no secret

533
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:36,850
and I'm sure this is no news to you

534
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:43,750
anyway and to wrap up what is the goal

535
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:47,918
of our interventions well we try to turn

536
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:51,429
data into digital evidence and this will

537
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:54,040
happen when the treatment is correct how

538
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:56,220
do we enable that correct treatment we

539
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,800
provide data with concrete

540
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:02,770
characteristics first integrity this

541
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,860
means that it hasn't been manipulated it

542
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:09,840
hasn't been tampered with if here you

543
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:12,690
see JJA JJA is what I take to the judge

544
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,640
that is what we call integrity

545
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:19,210
traceability know where it has gone

546
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,129
through today it's in my hands and

547
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,170
tomorrow it will be in somebody else's

548
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:26,110
hand and then into somebody else's and

549
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:29,530
that's the traceability and the

550
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:34,260
individuality that is to mark each

551
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:34,260
evidence in a singular way

552
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:47,709
Sacco isn't if we seize bag full of 50

553
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,780
mobile phones without any numbering or

554
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:53,320
anything there is no personalization or

555
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:55,480
singular ization whatsoever so these are

556
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,220
the three characteristics we need to

557
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:07,450
turn data into digital evidence with

558
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:12,879
true custody chain if we add a digital

559
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:18,580
signature md5 sha-1 we are expanding

560
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:23,260
that custody chain this may sound

561
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:25,630
strange it's not compulsory to have a

562
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,780
digital signature for every evidence I

563
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:30,670
will explain it later on what I wanted

564
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,520
to say here the point I wanted to make

565
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,470
was to explain the theory of the

566
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,280
poisoned tree what is the theory about

567
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:41,259
if I have an evidence and if I have

568
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:46,390
obtained more information out of that

569
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:49,960
evidence but if the first evidence was

570
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:53,680
obtained irregularly or illegally or

571
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:56,380
inadequately that evidence and all the

572
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,770
information I can take from that

573
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:03,460
evidence evidence will be invalidated

574
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:05,980
that's why we need to treat digital

575
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:09,340
evidence in an adequate manner from the

576
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:13,030
very beginning if we've made any mistake

577
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:16,090
at the moment of seizing it we are we

578
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,760
are wasting our time because the custody

579
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:22,870
chain is broken

580
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:27,910
the tree is poisoned so how do we avoid

581
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:32,350
this with the custody chain the pen

582
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:36,940
drive needs to be safeguarded in a bag

583
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:39,430
with a tag so that it is traceable and

584
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,770
we have to identify the custodians of

585
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:46,520
the time it's as simple as that

586
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:50,330
and of course the labeling of digital

587
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,640
evidence needs to be perfect here you

588
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:57,020
can see a black computer a pair of

589
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:59,210
sneakers and many other objects do you

590
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:02,500
think they are correctly labeled do you

591
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:05,330
think that these digital evidence are

592
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,460
correctly labeled please raise your

593
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,950
hands if you think this is correct

594
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,710
nobody thinks it's correct who believes

595
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:15,980
this is incorrect incorrectly labeled

596
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:17,780
this is a mess and the ones who don't

597
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,770
raise their hands is because it comes

598
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,700
from Galicia

599
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:25,550
as myself well then they are right

600
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:28,160
because the right answer is it depends

601
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:31,640
it depends on the kind of crime we are

602
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,240
investigated for example if these

603
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:40,640
evidence come from a car hijack or a car

604
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:43,609
theft that beer can the tobacco packs

605
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,080
etcetera if these objects were stolen

606
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:50,960
from a car these are these are solid

607
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,900
merchandize they are no digital evidence

608
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,630
and we don't need to guarantee the

609
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,250
custody chain of the data they have the

610
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:02,600
data belong to the person who's been

611
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:07,040
stolen so we need to label these objects

612
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:10,339
but not as digital evidence that's like

613
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,100
for example burgled at home and they

614
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:16,880
still my TV set from home or if my car

615
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:21,259
is stolen it depends on the crime that

616
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,020
we are investigating if it's a normal

617
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:27,080
evidence not a digital one we don't have

618
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,600
to label it necessarily I understand

619
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:33,310
it's I know that it's difficult to

620
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:37,040
understand but it's not that complicated

621
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:39,890
so it depends on the kind of evidence it

622
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,529
is a sensei and here is my portable

623
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:45,870
phone it is connected to 3G 4G or

624
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:50,280
whatever and imagine I made

625
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:54,210
and my police fellows arrest me and they

626
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:58,440
take my phone from me put it into a bag

627
00:39:54,210 --> 00:40:01,080
they tape it it is signed by five

628
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,260
different people and they do many things

629
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:07,980
do you believe that this has been

630
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:13,800
correctly labeled no because the phone

631
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:17,610
is on and it's covered so it's useless

632
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:21,090
to have it inside a sealed bag if

633
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:23,730
somebody from the outside can connect to

634
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:28,100
it and delete all the contents inside

635
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:31,650
this will be nothing but a seized stone

636
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:37,680
so we need to take care of these tiny

637
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:41,690
details so we can use the aircraft mode

638
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:48,230
on the phone in order to avoid

639
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:51,450
manipulations on the evidence and any

640
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:55,770
procedures that we perform on the phone

641
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:59,609
shall be registered in writing for

642
00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:04,680
example this phone went into the phone

643
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:10,140
mode this day and at this time then the

644
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:13,169
bag that we use has metallic thread so

645
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:16,770
any device that goes inside the back

646
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:20,250
loses its coverage because radio

647
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:24,210
frequency is inhibited so the mobile

648
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:26,970
phone is without coverage there is a

649
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:30,170
problem if I use one of these bags the

650
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:34,620
mobile doesn't have a coverage but

651
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:36,900
Mobile's are designed to be covered at

652
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:41,580
all times so they would use their

653
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:43,530
antennas at their maximum you know that

654
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:47,069
you gain that coverage that way they

655
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:50,670
will use more and more electricity and

656
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:53,520
with made things worse because the more

657
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:57,390
while would have gone off in five hours

658
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,230
say and now it's going to go off in 40

659
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:03,440
minutes

660
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:07,020
so what we do is use an external battery

661
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,940
to avoid that this is the thing that we

662
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,339
have to bear in mind if we don't keep

663
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:18,900
that in mind we may see as a portable

664
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:22,529
phone and it may be shut down what about

665
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:25,859
the pen droids these flash drives if I

666
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:29,400
have a flash drive and I well this is a

667
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:35,750
digital evidence by the way so if I hook

668
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:41,150
it up to a laptop or a desktop computer

669
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:45,720
windows it's going to write on the USB

670
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:49,740
unit if Windows writes on that unit we

671
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,839
are slightly altering that unity the

672
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:55,379
theory of the poison tree I talked about

673
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,509
the evidence is useless if we need to

674
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:02,010
analyze a flash drive we need to do it

675
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:04,170
correctly how when the flash drive is

676
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:06,710
connected to the computer the computer

677
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:09,180
needs to be configured in read-only mode

678
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:12,690
this is something that we can do with

679
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:16,980
software or with the modification of

680
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:20,819
keys so from that moment on every device

681
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:25,560
we use will work and read only mode only

682
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:28,800
so if we try to rename a file or do

683
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:33,089
anything on the unit we want to be able

684
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:37,109
to because we are in read-only mode it's

685
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:41,970
true that the forensic analysis systems

686
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:44,700
are configured this way and if on a

687
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:47,040
later stage we want to do something

688
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:50,220
about that there's that flash drive we

689
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,990
can do it but we don't have to rush

690
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:56,970
because sometimes if we stick that flash

691
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,540
drive in our computer and it's not in

692
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:03,089
read-only mode we are in trouble in

693
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:07,500
Windows usually when we run a programmer

694
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:09,529
software in order to avoid overriding

695
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:13,280
the antivirus

696
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:17,840
sometimes blocks that software and when

697
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,740
we believe that that we are covered we

698
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:24,770
aren't because the autorun feature

699
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:28,370
popped up how do we avoid this with

700
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:31,100
Hardware blockers this is just a device

701
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:34,009
that acts as a bridge between the

702
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:37,700
computer and the units we want to

703
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:41,720
connect and it's all protected against

704
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:43,939
writing no matter how our computer is

705
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,390
set up it is impossible to manipulate

706
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:50,860
that evidence I've used the yellow one

707
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:56,029
because it's the most noticeable one

708
00:44:50,860 --> 00:45:01,150
they have some sort of switch that can

709
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:06,050
change from read-only to writable modes

710
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:09,970
they have this pin as I said just buried

711
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:12,560
and mine so to wrap up if we've

712
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:15,439
adequately treated all the digital

713
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:19,549
evidence as we have said we can go to

714
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,880
the judge and provide evidence that is

715
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:26,680
totally valid for a trial that can be

716
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:32,180
considered by the judge in order to

717
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:35,089
dictate sentence based on evidence that

718
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:36,040
have been taken correctly and this is

719
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:41,110
our purpose

720
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:45,170
Ari Gold provide evidence and data

721
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:48,770
objectively and validly so if we go that

722
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:51,920
far we've really walked a long way this

723
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:58,070
was on my part I hope I wasn't too

724
00:45:51,920 --> 00:46:00,410
boring it's been a real pleasure to tell

725
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:05,090
you a little bit about our work our

726
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:08,220
difficulties and how we overcome them so

727
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:10,280
my pleasure thank you very much

728
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,279
you

729
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,980
you
