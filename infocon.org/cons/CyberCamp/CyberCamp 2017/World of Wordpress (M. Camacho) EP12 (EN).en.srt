1
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:29,560
let's see if you can tell on this is a

2
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:33,629
presentation about the WordPress and you

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:39,030
might wonder what is all these about her

4
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:44,800
being WordPress something very simple

5
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:51,309
but in fact I'm going to focus my

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,830
presentation to security I'm not going

7
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:58,059
to teach you how to set the WordPress

8
00:00:53,830 --> 00:01:03,099
site but offensive and defensive

9
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:05,408
security before getting to the

10
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,479
presentation I will speak a little bit

11
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:15,909
about myself I will introduce myself I

12
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:23,679
work as an re auditor for SVT security

13
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:26,590
service also have some other projects in

14
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:30,729
addition to the useful worker a security

15
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:35,049
company I'm responsible for security

16
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:38,590
audits I do not work with hardware or

17
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:44,009
any other thing I just tried to break

18
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:48,190
things in a way which is not always easy

19
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,710
as I said I am in a project the name is

20
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:53,649
[Music]

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:57,999
Huck and B's I am co-founder of this

22
00:01:53,649 --> 00:02:01,659
project together with a team I write in

23
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:05,889
ninety publication since 2009 I don't

24
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:08,979
really have much time to write I also a

25
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:12,850
member of the cool to Congress that we

26
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:18,160
held in Cordoba is a free Congress and

27
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:22,930
I'm also a member of solidarity hacking

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:26,640
they are altruistic projects some of

29
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:30,930
them we don't get much profit

30
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,540
from them but we might think that if

31
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:38,180
something is for free he may not be

32
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:41,370
worthwhile but I participate in those

33
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:51,990
nonprofit projects because I love them

34
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:56,160
and in my free time I just teach people

35
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:58,709
about security I help parents to teach

36
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:05,489
their children and my presentation will

37
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:10,530
be available to you this is my

38
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:16,640
disclaimer as my friend Fran advised me

39
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:20,070
to introduce in my presentation and and

40
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:24,510
therefore I'm not responsible for any

41
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:27,269
illegitimate use of this presentation or

42
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:32,190
any of the content I hope you don't

43
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:34,530
start break-in devices after hearing my

44
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:38,070
presentation and therefore the contents

45
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:42,209
are for teaching purposes I will start

46
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:44,940
by the most boring part introducing

47
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,810
WordPress in case you don't know much

48
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,000
about it

49
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:55,709
WordPress is a content management system

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:03,410
CMS to create a website is user-friendly

51
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:08,310
and simple it belongs to what we know as

52
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:13,590
CMS management content management

53
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:17,420
systems will be was launched in 2003 so

54
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,420
it's been on for quite some time

55
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:31,789
the license is GPL in open-source is not

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,199
is free server is not the same as open

57
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:49,099
source and is been optimized for CEO

58
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:52,990
today what is important what is gonna

59
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:57,380
make us well-known is our CEO

60
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:59,479
positioning why world.press because it's

61
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,569
very popular I'm not gonna use the CMS

62
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:10,190
that is used in China by just 100 people

63
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:17,180
it wouldn't be meaningful here as I show

64
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:19,009
you before 28.9% in Internet I don't

65
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,520
know much about those statistics

66
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:27,650
although they are taken from reliable

67
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:36,258
data source per 28.9% is WordPress use

68
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:45,169
is used by almost 76 million users of a

69
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:47,150
wordpress.com until some statistics this

70
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:51,710
is my source as you can see in the slide

71
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:55,609
we speak about millions of users here's

72
00:05:51,710 --> 00:06:01,180
some more statistics about the use 29%

73
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:06,400
from rather reliable source and jung-hwa

74
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:12,259
Drupal machine tone and some others

75
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:18,258
that's why I tell WordPress we also have

76
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:22,159
many customers business and people that

77
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:25,550
contact me by Twitter or private message

78
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:29,029
and they asked about the wordpress about

79
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:31,369
its vulnerabilities or when I reported

80
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:36,879
about any potential vulnerabilities

81
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:41,269
related to mistake or failure in the

82
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:43,629
settings because WordPress is used by

83
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:46,759
thousands and millions of people we have

84
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:49,969
thousands of potential victims if we're

85
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:53,959
using a CMS that is just by 100 people

86
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:57,529
then it wouldn't be worth to start

87
00:06:53,959 --> 00:07:02,860
considering it it's quite popular and is

88
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:06,169
the only system with more than 40,000

89
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:11,689
complementary features this data is six

90
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:15,349
months old forty thousand plug-in that

91
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:20,089
we can add to WordPress the official

92
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:23,058
repository outside it it will be an

93
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:28,639
unlimited number almost an additional

94
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:32,479
forty thousand so we have a very

95
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:38,059
important entry vector the use of

96
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:42,110
WordPress without plug-ins and then we

97
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:45,259
have the plugins as an entry vector this

98
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:49,099
is also going to be quite important when

99
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:50,869
I will show you a contact Testim you

100
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,719
will realize what I'm talking about just

101
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:59,329
to give you some more information this

102
00:07:53,719 --> 00:08:02,779
screenshot is one year old it provides

103
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:10,089
information about Hockett websites and

104
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:12,949
those are the samples of a shelf in

105
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,139
remote and you see how can you inject a

106
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:19,159
shell in a very few lines and those are

107
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:22,550
the results of you certain internet you

108
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:25,879
will have a lot of information get to

109
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:31,750
the sent just limit yourself to the

110
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:40,000
search do not across this threshold and

111
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:45,110
you may wonder I am poet I published my

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,380
beautiful poems in WordPress why would

113
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:54,470
anybody attack my wordpress site if I'm

114
00:08:48,380 --> 00:09:00,339
just an artist the reason might be quite

115
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:05,990
logical the CEO we can use a website and

116
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:12,380
I will introduce it later on but a group

117
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:13,459
of a hacked the website can improve the

118
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:19,870
CEO of

119
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:25,899
another website you can change the code

120
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:31,850
so to benefit from your positioning for

121
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:34,550
spam massive um campaigns if you realize

122
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:37,430
in filtering the spam

123
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:43,399
they just say your server is doing this

124
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:48,469
or that so if they're sending spam they

125
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:52,519
can get to send run somewhere

126
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:59,050
phishing the famous ransomware that we

127
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:59,050
are all talking about nowadays as I said

128
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:13,060
they can send my were through a

129
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:18,680
ransomware they can steal passwords

130
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:23,780
banking information credit cards I found

131
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:27,739
work WordPress sites that are very easy

132
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:33,050
to break in anybody can just get the

133
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:39,530
passwords and is also used for pivoting

134
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:43,449
to attack a third site using yours you

135
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:47,660
can get into a middle website just to

136
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:52,780
through pivot in attacking some other

137
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:56,030
websites for example for service denials

138
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:58,040
there might be other reasons maybe

139
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:02,230
somebody's just boring and just likes to

140
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,930
attack your website the difference

141
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:10,520
targeted attacks versus non targeted

142
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:13,209
attacks the difference is quite large if

143
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:18,710
they are targeted you know that you are

144
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:21,230
the victim if they are not targeted you

145
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,540
will be a potential victim these might

146
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:27,400
be for personal reasons because you just

147
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,400
want to bother somebody

148
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:39,950
and the reasons might be many do you do

149
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:43,940
as I said personal reasons it is

150
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:47,760
targeted only to your WordPress site

151
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:55,310
- and we're speaking about WordPress

152
00:11:47,760 --> 00:12:01,769
here so it will be a total attack and

153
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:05,969
then if you want to or if they want to

154
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:10,500
get some economic benefit from your

155
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:13,410
website or lower their reputation then

156
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,769
we have the most common ones the non

157
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:19,760
targeted attacks there aren't any

158
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:23,209
personal reasons they are based in

159
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:27,540
default settings and the attackers

160
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:33,709
almost never are not interested in what

161
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,709
you say in your blog devoted to trains

162
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:43,560
they don't care about your personal

163
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:49,459
comments and there are many different

164
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:53,910
internet tools Google being that can

165
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:58,529
localize websites just by pure boredom

166
00:12:53,910 --> 00:13:03,449
or using an API or a specific version

167
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:07,770
and they can apply different systems to

168
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:14,549
attack your website those would be what

169
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:21,809
we call automated attacks Oh wasp

170
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:21,809
uses or is based in secure development

171
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:31,929
for secure developments and you can also

172
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:35,279
audit cell phones and websites based on

173
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:38,169
certain controls that are applied to all

174
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,229
security layers from the most basic ones

175
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:46,569
to the more sophisticated as dynamic

176
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:50,519
analysis of a spam or almost everybody

177
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:55,329
uses a wasp to follow a secure

178
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:58,329
methodology a few days ago we now have

179
00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:01,419
the always part of ten with some a

180
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:06,758
slight modification with information

181
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:08,289
about the most common controls okay let

182
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:13,749
us get to the nitty-gritty

183
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:17,289
we just gone through the introduction

184
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:20,169
that is quite boring it was quite boring

185
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:23,949
but now we are going to get to the gist

186
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:26,019
of my presentation about hardening what

187
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:27,488
are we going to defend are we going to

188
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:31,119
limit ourselves to the wordpress

189
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:36,100
dashboard and we fill it with blogs in

190
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:41,669
or are we going to get a little bit

191
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,669
further as you can see

192
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:50,000
I will give you some recommendations for

193
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:55,700
the hardening at the server level and at

194
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:04,570
the WordPress level what about the

195
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:08,810
server these conditions will not be 100%

196
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:12,320
met they are quite difficult for

197
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:14,599
different reasons when people ask me

198
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,830
I'll tell me I went to have a web site

199
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,510
in WordPress or any other VPS is more

200
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,160
expensive yes is true that is more

201
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:27,080
expensive you can have a share hosting

202
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:35,140
with your neighbor if you don't want to

203
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:40,399
pay to avoid share hosting if our

204
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:44,120
WordPress is secured and my hosting

205
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,810
neighbor is not it wouldn't be very

206
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,600
useful if they access my neighbor's

207
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:53,839
WordPress website and they can escalate

208
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:59,350
and this has been the case in many

209
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:04,100
occasions and share hosting is more

210
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:07,839
difficult to have root access to our

211
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:11,360
server in order to do the necessary

212
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:16,010
amendments we don't need limitations in

213
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:24,829
this case one of the recommendations is

214
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:31,130
not to use SSH access a basic user to

215
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:37,699
the login and once they are inside root

216
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:43,939
should always be limited to as a age and

217
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:49,600
to reduce the exposure serve

218
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:55,720
area if we're using a pass J or angle

219
00:16:49,600 --> 00:17:01,460
this should be uninstalled it should be

220
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:05,630
limiting setting is quite a pain but we

221
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:11,060
reduce the exposure area is not the same

222
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:14,810
to have 100 volts open than just one the

223
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:17,270
use of an updated release of the OS this

224
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:21,740
is quite common we all speak about

225
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:24,200
updating and me myself I don't always

226
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:28,250
have everything updated weather because

227
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:33,350
I forget the server should always be

228
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:39,230
updated with releases control and ports

229
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:43,189
control the use of new PHP releases in

230
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:45,920
Apache or gangs always they have the

231
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,560
updated release even though the

232
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,850
availability may not be compatible or

233
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:56,659
our customer has things that are not

234
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,850
compatible with our website but are many

235
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:03,940
different ways to test everything before

236
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:07,850
updating it of course the use of

237
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,760
powerful passwords in theory everyone

238
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:13,250
knows about this but in practice or in

239
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:18,040
real life the situation is quite

240
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:22,330
different a dual authentication factor I

241
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:24,770
just wrote the acronyms here dual

242
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,500
authentication factor not only Google

243
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:31,040
there is a multiplicity of a services

244
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:35,500
after the do authentication service by

245
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:41,090
email by SMS or through an application

246
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:44,860
we can use different means and even then

247
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:50,090
they can hack your account as a

248
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:53,029
colleague told me yesterday that

249
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:56,889
one of his friends and a yes though him

250
00:18:53,029 --> 00:19:00,080
to big coins even using a dual

251
00:18:56,889 --> 00:19:01,428
authentication factor and this is what

252
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,689
happened to him

253
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:06,349
another important recommendation is the

254
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,830
port

255
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:14,779
knocking is quite a pain and if you want

256
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:17,840
to do quick changes is difficult do you

257
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:24,080
know about the port knocking does it

258
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:28,668
ring a bell I just explained it what

259
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,249
knocking is to close the SSH connection

260
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:33,769
to the server if we connect port 22 or

261
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:37,309
we change the port to have another one

262
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:40,759
you wouldn't be able to log in in order

263
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:46,700
to log in we need to make different

264
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:50,450
calls to the ports tell from our team so

265
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:56,570
that the port is open in the server and

266
00:19:50,450 --> 00:20:04,700
the service SSH a we can call port 81

267
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:08,479
900 and 1024 so in order to close we add

268
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:12,469
a different combination so we reduce the

269
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:15,049
exposure area is also restrictive is

270
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:16,729
quite a pain when I have to change

271
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:21,080
things and I don't know exactly what

272
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:27,999
type of port we have to change it's very

273
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:27,999
simple then we have anti-do s service

274
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:38,869
as a mother ever see for a party in

275
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:44,509
jeans I don't know so much about it this

276
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:46,759
merger my blog possible attack server

277
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:50,629
service denial at the level of the

278
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:54,799
applications route if they want to

279
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:56,418
damage our return it does not protect it

280
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,340
I'm speaking about the applications

281
00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:06,769
level is quite powerful is easy to set

282
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:11,658
and another recommendation is port

283
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:14,119
century he can set the reports you want

284
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:18,070
to show when there is a scanning and

285
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:24,249
they are what we call faked ports

286
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:31,580
another recommendation is faked one when

287
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:36,200
they apply strength to the ssh they look

288
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:41,478
the users the IP d host and this is

289
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:47,899
quite simple to install and is not very

290
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:54,019
much used a reduces level maybe business

291
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:59,570
at the business level the either but why

292
00:21:54,019 --> 00:22:01,700
we going to allow 100 intrusion attacks

293
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,369
at the fifth or sixth attack we should

294
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,619
blocker system there are many other

295
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:11,619
things that we can apply at a server

296
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:16,059
level but it will be too much and I

297
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:20,059
don't want to be too elitist here now

298
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:21,700
for century if I'm scanning the port

299
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:25,999
what does it happen

300
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:28,849
we have ports that are not really up and

301
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:33,169
running ports the do not even X system

302
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:35,029
just trying to this is my enemy and this

303
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:38,040
is the scan of the boards that are

304
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:44,330
really open with the port centric

305
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:44,330
switched off we can fine-tune or set

306
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,720
limits and there are beautiful settings

307
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:56,910
and some others that are not this is a

308
00:22:51,720 --> 00:23:00,870
really basic way of setting things by

309
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:03,420
default anniversary though a modern

310
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:06,479
Aldama dynamic we can automate this

311
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:09,360
through scripts scripts that are

312
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,750
targeted towards the directory where

313
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,850
WordPress is hosted I like to mention

314
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:19,350
something that I believe is very

315
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:23,879
important for those of you that are not

316
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:27,149
familiar with this Danny and mother now

317
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,470
is plugging is pretty cool what it does

318
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:35,900
is as follows here you have the window

319
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:43,860
you can apply these settings to change

320
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:48,620
authorizations for folders you can apply

321
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:55,139
a restrictive authorization directory

322
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:58,590
you can apply ext files report files

323
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:02,250
it's a very interesting plugin there's

324
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:04,949
also an option for tin tub libraries

325
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:11,610
that were vulnerable it also has a

326
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:14,730
wizard a wizard for blue units it's

327
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:18,300
quite interesting if you take a look and

328
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:20,680
then this new version he has included a

329
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,990
malware scanner

330
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,870
much could be done recording much could

331
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:29,360
be set so we regarding more analysis

332
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:32,270
because there are many infected sites

333
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,490
that are hard to clean and there are

334
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,650
very interesting applications for more

335
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:40,580
but we don't have time to cover this

336
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:43,490
here and he also has an application that

337
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:51,080
I haven't tested with just years are far

338
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:54,320
well that is a kind of fire will so I

339
00:24:51,080 --> 00:25:01,909
invite you to check Danny and my than

340
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:04,429
others bookings let's get into just a

341
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,320
matter here into the nitty-gritty in

342
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,170
terms of the server what is most

343
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:13,280
important

344
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:16,910
well if we have PHP that unfortunately

345
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:23,750
is a bit old you need to disable the

346
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:25,430
register global variables and this means

347
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,960
that whenever we want to introduce

348
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:32,960
changes or do updates an error message

349
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:37,760
is published this is something we need

350
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:41,210
to consider when updating what may be

351
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,060
very comfortable can be problematic we

352
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,350
need to disable the safe mode we need to

353
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:52,460
disable a well some features that

354
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:59,500
shouldn't be activated or enabled path

355
00:25:52,460 --> 00:26:04,850
through PHP info and there are many HP

356
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:09,300
info in andalucía there is

357
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:12,919
myriad of phpinfo and the internet that

358
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:15,540
provides you with interesting

359
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,190
information whenever we do information

360
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,580
gathering with this which is the first

361
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:23,130
step of an audit this is interesting of

362
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:26,340
course so whatever you're not using you

363
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:30,260
should disable that's the rule that you

364
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,260
should follow it's pretty simple

365
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:44,550
another tip or advice for you well we

366
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:47,489
need to put modify where we have the HPI

367
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:50,850
files and we need to tell the computer

368
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:55,309
what it needs to run or execute we need

369
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:58,379
to also specify where our WordPress is

370
00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:00,720
depending on the operating systems a

371
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:03,210
system we're using it would be in one

372
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,600
directory or another participant change

373
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:09,570
much we need to tell the software word

374
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:13,530
is and it will only execute the

375
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:18,360
wordpress there specifically if we want

376
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:22,500
to fine-tune this further well though

377
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:27,000
maybe I'm getting too detailed here but

378
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:30,900
it would we could do a cage to case

379
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,750
everything in and isolate it that's also

380
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:40,110
interesting and advisable and I wanted

381
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:42,080
to include an observation here because

382
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:47,000
some people believe that within a

383
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:51,330
function or feature we can

384
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,450
well bypass this however it's very

385
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,490
important to disable this in our

386
00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:02,040
WordPress side of course there's a

387
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:06,210
technique to surpass of a machine but

388
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,720
it's not easy it's got some complexity

389
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:13,580
[Music]

390
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:17,300
we need to protect the HT file so that

391
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:21,730
it's not accessible that's where we're

392
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:27,100
going to introduce or specify the denied

393
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:34,460
eyepiece we shouldn't do absurd backups

394
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:38,419
HC XS dot back dot XP it's you should

395
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:41,450
not do these backups that's not a good

396
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:44,540
idea if we want to do a backup it's

397
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:48,770
better to do it outside the public

398
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:53,840
directory and another piece of advice is

399
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:59,780
to not list directories we need to

400
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:03,740
disable the index off there will come a

401
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:06,379
time or a moment of time in which you

402
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,960
introduce a file that you believe is

403
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:12,530
protected but it will be listed and you

404
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,730
will be able to see the contents thereof

405
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:20,560
so this is not advisable as for

406
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:24,440
directory lists there are many an

407
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:28,790
infinity and I found even administrator

408
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:32,200
passwords believe it or not so this is

409
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:39,889
not theory this happens in practice

410
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:42,890
let's move on the gardening is a weird

411
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:47,809
term gardening

412
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:50,770
the context of WordPress and servers we

413
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:55,370
need to avoid user numbering

414
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:57,530
why because if we avoid this they won't

415
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,540
be able to know what users or how many

416
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:06,950
users we have we're not giving them

417
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:10,549
clues we want to hide info Rama enemies

418
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:15,620
if we know that the user of WordPress

419
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:18,770
admin 2017 slash P we know that we need

420
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,270
to apply the brute force of that user if

421
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:25,970
we're unaware of that we use through

422
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:29,150
well we can't do that so we are hiding

423
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:32,179
info and then exposure service that's

424
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:35,360
also an important variable this could be

425
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:42,140
basically summed up as reducing exposure

426
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:45,199
surface how do we avoid user listing and

427
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:49,220
WordPress well by modifying the database

428
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,309
and you may say well in adjustments we

429
00:30:49,220 --> 00:31:00,410
can change the alias yes but you need to

430
00:30:52,309 --> 00:31:02,149
do this and database level the reetou

431
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,880
very very careful with this is follow

432
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:10,340
these changes we need to also change or

433
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:17,390
modify the value of the table WP user

434
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:23,540
and the user next name as well here you

435
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:28,360
can see a sample of user listing who has

436
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:32,450
USB p WP skin yeah you for use WP skin

437
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:35,178
it basically enlists the users and the

438
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:38,120
plugins sometimes if it invents the

439
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:40,970
results but it's quite interesting

440
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,409
because with experience you're able to

441
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:50,710
distinguish

442
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:54,730
the users what am I trying to say here

443
00:31:50,710 --> 00:32:00,010
when I refer to a nice name in the table

444
00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:04,809
that I use we modified the value let's

445
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:09,160
imagine that my user is Edmund and in

446
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:12,520
the row or in the column where there is

447
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:17,679
a matching between that and the username

448
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:22,780
I cannot introduce my changes what can I

449
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:27,130
do well instead of Edmund I could enter

450
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:31,330
that same webmaster in that case the

451
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:34,570
user will see that the article has been

452
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:38,290
published by webmaster but we won't be

453
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:44,200
telling him that the article has been

454
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:46,000
not drafted by webmaster I'm gonna talk

455
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,600
with a live account or two indeed every

456
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,910
well I've already covered this so

457
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:59,678
there's a people how can we list users

458
00:32:53,910 --> 00:33:05,260
yes perhaps using a script but perhaps

459
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:07,809
that's not the best way around it why

460
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:11,350
are we going to reinvent the wheel some

461
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:15,490
people may say we can list the users

462
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:20,530
with that URL I've included on this

463
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:24,390
slide with that slug that you can see we

464
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,389
can list users

465
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:34,490
and there are a myriad of sites that

466
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:38,450
have lists of users we're talking about

467
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:44,540
user names here and we can also obtain

468
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:47,830
the WordPress version with that cool or

469
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:51,379
request to that file and some sites

470
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:53,689
specify the WordPress version that

471
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:57,140
you're using we're trying to get to know

472
00:33:53,690 --> 00:34:00,590
our site better we have our website

473
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:06,380
we're going to check and verify user

474
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:12,259
listing and we're going to make that

475
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:15,429
request to the program then we verify WP

476
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:18,669
links open mail and you'll get to know

477
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:24,918
WordPress version we're talking about

478
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:29,600
once again user and numbering we can

479
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:33,290
change the ILS alias this doesn't mean

480
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,980
that we're changing the user name no not

481
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:37,580
at all

482
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:40,219
we're just changing the nickname and

483
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:44,440
then you have the user name field and

484
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:51,469
that's the value you will have to modify

485
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:54,200
in order to deceive your enemies good

486
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:58,310
this is something I've already covered

487
00:34:54,199 --> 00:35:01,609
and we have HTTP drive if you connected

488
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:06,770
to the Wi-Fi and introduce or enter our

489
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:10,610
username well we've basically messed up

490
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:13,610
already that's not the way to go let me

491
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:16,160
give you some advice we can change the

492
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:19,490
profile but if we change the profile

493
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,620
then we forget about the changes we

494
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:25,910
introduced and some people believe it's

495
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:28,870
better not to modify profiles the idea

496
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:33,910
is to be able to hide em

497
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:39,160
to enhance security I know very little

498
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:42,879
people that isolate WP comfy outside the

499
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:46,420
public space the idea is that the rude

500
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,950
essence inside are pulled excited if we

501
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:53,770
make sure that it's outside we are

502
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:58,660
protecting WP comfy witches were our

503
00:35:53,770 --> 00:36:02,259
username or serve our database password

504
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:09,000
are another piece of advice is to

505
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:13,360
protect WP admin to disable the template

506
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:19,510
editor let's imagine I have my topic

507
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:22,180
I've customized ed or I've downloaded it

508
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:26,350
from a link that I've received an

509
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:28,500
infected link I have my site up and

510
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:32,650
running and I'm not willing to introduce

511
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:36,970
constant changes I have the template

512
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:40,350
editor enabled because I don't intend to

513
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:43,930
introduce changes in a near-future

514
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:48,339
modifier error messages regarding the

515
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:51,669
logging if this message pops up what

516
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:54,160
will happen while depending on the

517
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:56,580
message here we see for the logo you'll

518
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,649
know what version we're talking about

519
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:02,560
you can understand what version you're

520
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:07,360
talking about we can modify logging

521
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:10,600
error messages as we will see change and

522
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:14,580
the prefixes of tables this is something

523
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:17,259
that we could do WordPress underscore

524
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:21,299
it's very important to do a backup

525
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:24,430
before we do this to avoid a scare and

526
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:28,540
if it's working progress we need to be

527
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:32,819
very very careful we can change prefixes

528
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,820
as described on this slide

529
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:39,849
you can use the plugging some specified

530
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:44,440
there and let's be very very careful

531
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:48,160
when we're talking about websites that

532
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:52,329
are being developed and then it's very

533
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:56,799
important that we're careful with the WP

534
00:37:52,329 --> 00:38:00,509
config dot PHP we need to create a new

535
00:37:56,799 --> 00:38:04,479
PHP configuration or setting file within

536
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:08,529
the WordPress root well I said earlier

537
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:10,868
that it had to be outside the folder so

538
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:14,499
why am I saying this now why are we

539
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:19,509
going to create another WP config dot

540
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:24,160
PHP as you can see this is the request

541
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:27,900
to the one that's outside or the cool so

542
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:32,259
we're able to prompt the WP config

543
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:35,170
because with this without the config dot

544
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:39,339
PHP in the directory it won't work so

545
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:43,209
we're making call making a request to WP

546
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:46,989
config or to him that or you're telling

547
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:49,538
it rather that it's isolated well let's

548
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:53,709
be very very careful with the open base

549
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:56,979
deal we need to be very careful this can

550
00:38:53,709 --> 00:39:00,390
also be problematic you're going to see

551
00:38:56,979 --> 00:39:03,489
how the park locks will pop up

552
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:08,709
repeatedly that's it very careful with

553
00:39:03,489 --> 00:39:14,109
this feature as well disabling template

554
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:18,029
editors if as I said everything is ready

555
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:20,440
it's up and running it looks wonderful

556
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:25,959
why are we going to have this feature

557
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:30,099
enabled with WP config you can define

558
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:33,249
interesting features just find a file

559
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:34,950
edit and this allows you to edit the

560
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:38,730
topic

561
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:43,368
you can enable or disable this and if

562
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:46,470
you disable this basically you're

563
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:49,170
protecting vulnerabilities that's the

564
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:53,310
idea behind this as the reason behind

565
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:55,650
this and security keys that need to be

566
00:39:53,310 --> 00:40:00,089
added to the logging process there's an

567
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:03,470
API to generate randomly these security

568
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:12,450
keys you can do this through WP config

569
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:15,839
it's hard for me to pronounce this in

570
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:18,299
this provides yet another security layer

571
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,630
to the login process and to the

572
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:25,500
encryption of plugins as I said of the

573
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:29,430
beginning in my presentation now is

574
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:31,980
going to cover all these features we

575
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:39,859
need to protect files we need to protect

576
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:44,700
h bx s and h h pass axis so this means

577
00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:50,359
that everything that starts with dot h p

578
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:50,359
is denied so there is no way around this

579
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:59,849
wow this one is shining so there's full

580
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:04,140
mm denial so we're protecting this to

581
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:06,720
prevent directory listing you may think

582
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:14,190
that it's very difficult that there are

583
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:17,819
many file and we have an empty age 80 ml

584
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:23,250
we're preventing directory lists it's a

585
00:41:17,819 --> 00:41:25,680
bit of a clumsy way of doing this but it

586
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:30,940
can be done it'll be better however to

587
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:34,660
use apache if you enable option indexer

588
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:38,049
okay move scalable or rather key

589
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:44,828
directories for a fine tuning here we're

590
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:47,140
honing so this means that we will of

591
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:49,210
course have our further work to do in

592
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:53,529
the management or administration of this

593
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:58,059
side will become more complex WP

594
00:41:53,530 --> 00:42:00,700
plugging sorties it's hard to move we

595
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:04,270
need to have our directory but it can be

596
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:07,960
the new topics can be installed and new

597
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:14,730
directories and we need to be very very

598
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:18,730
careful with open base hiding hiding

599
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:22,750
it's hard to see is far too small hiding

600
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:26,619
the set of errors if we enable WP config

601
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:30,280
dot PHP we're enabling these are lines

602
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:33,250
of code so we won't see errors so when

603
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,890
malicious attackers want to access our

604
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:40,619
side we won't reveal absolutely anything

605
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:46,960
to him about our WordPress site

606
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:51,270
protecting WP admin we can add with HP

607
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:57,309
power that when someone clicks or rather

608
00:42:51,270 --> 00:43:07,779
enters WP admin in our URL this person

609
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:11,220
will be asked to enter a password hiding

610
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:11,220
default versions

611
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:20,069
for those of you that do audits um if

612
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:24,809
we're working with WordPress this is of

613
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:28,440
great help because you know what the

614
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:32,670
WordPress version is if the WordPress

615
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:35,430
tells me that it uses save development

616
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:39,079
we know it's version 4 for example and

617
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:43,799
if it's version 4.7 as we will see now

618
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:46,500
we feel very much reassured it can hide

619
00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:49,829
the default version we can disable this

620
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:53,839
function this feature but whenever you

621
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:57,569
update WordPress that default version is

622
00:43:53,839 --> 00:44:04,558
re-enabled we can directly block this

623
00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:08,960
using Apache and I can for example block

624
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:12,059
license and I can introduce the version

625
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:16,200
I'd also like to say that each time we

626
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:19,500
update WordPress this appears once again

627
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:22,859
so it doesn't make much sense to erase

628
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,809
it in apache we can block this with

629
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:29,058
those lines of code that you can see on

630
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:29,059
screen and that's the end of the story

631
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:41,379
big la famosa rest happy okay we read

632
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,780
API basically this allows you to list

633
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:49,980
users this is what I was saying earlier

634
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:55,630
regarding WP and the idea with this is

635
00:44:49,980 --> 00:45:00,580
to list users this is another way of

636
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:04,080
listing users and of course there are

637
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:09,670
other techniques that are author based

638
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:13,270
but use the IDs that can be used but our

639
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:16,060
Edie API allows us to list users and

640
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:20,259
there are many sites important or major

641
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:24,190
aside that allow you to access to the

642
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:29,050
surnames of the users they create users

643
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:33,520
and usernames you have a great amount of

644
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:36,790
info there you can block these um using

645
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:40,450
plugins plugins not only aimed at

646
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:43,300
blocking the API network if we don't

647
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:46,290
want to complicate our lives further we

648
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,290
can use this option

649
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:58,950
so anti denial-of-service do s is easy

650
00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:01,799
with a cloud fair with cloud fair we can

651
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:04,259
protect our site at an application level

652
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:06,839
let's be careful with cloud fair apps

653
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:11,460
because if the subdomains are not well

654
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:15,499
said we cannot install the eyepiece and

655
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:20,220
now we can have our service crashed

656
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:22,078
there is a free scheme but let's make

657
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:25,980
sure that we're careful because have you

658
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:29,700
received many visits well the speed is

659
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:32,069
very much affected and it can be very

660
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:35,730
frustrating if you don't have a many

661
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:41,690
visits it's a very simple and effective

662
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:45,569
methods and you can disable it I

663
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:53,009
remember I calling an AI and we're

664
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:54,839
talking about this and and we were

665
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:58,859
talking about whether we have to enable

666
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:03,538
or disable this function I would disable

667
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:06,598
it always always I believe that we

668
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:09,480
should go for maximum censorship because

669
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:13,559
they can perpetrate denial-of-service

670
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:17,759
attacks and with this a method they can

671
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:21,779
crash your side you can well affect the

672
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:24,650
speed of this site and there's

673
00:47:21,779 --> 00:47:30,180
issue that it can be bugged by your HP

674
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:35,369
X's specifying that all the calls are

675
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:37,799
requests made to our PC should be a tag

676
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:42,630
or we can just sell the plugging a text

677
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:45,150
blocker or stop our PC attack as you can

678
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:50,700
see on the screen check pack allows this

679
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:53,730
it's restricted but they are over about

680
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:57,279
the request or the cold and there's a

681
00:47:53,730 --> 00:48:03,340
filtering that is done it's a plugin

682
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:06,520
it's a good plugging so she said what

683
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:11,640
else can I say another thing that you

684
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:15,160
can find yourself with brute force

685
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:19,960
protect your logging if we only have the

686
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:23,250
user and of course there's much we can

687
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:27,610
do they're not going to access our

688
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:33,610
password but they will access logs so

689
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:35,890
the solution would be of course plugging

690
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:42,370
and I'm going to mention several pug

691
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:47,140
plugins that I like to use and the

692
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:51,150
Google version it's pretty good it works

693
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:57,009
pretty well I'm a bit fed up of us

694
00:48:51,150 --> 00:49:00,880
selecting the boxes but that surprise

695
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:06,190
you need to pay to protect this mmm

696
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:09,130
two-digit occasion via text message or

697
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:11,670
email if you change mobile phone things

698
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:14,470
get complicated it's quite a bore I

699
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:16,810
decided to stop using Google

700
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:20,819
Authenticator because I changed smart

701
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:25,180
phone and it was always a very

702
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:28,180
cumbersome but there was this option of

703
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:30,520
installing the app in your mobile then

704
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:33,990
you have the locking and using your

705
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,990
smart phone camera

706
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:41,269
you were able to log into the system of

707
00:49:38,749 --> 00:49:46,308
course you had to enter your credentials

708
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:52,399
I don't have a snapshot of a screenshot

709
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:54,019
story of this it was a free app but it's

710
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,319
no longer available it was quite

711
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:59,118
interesting though it was cool and then

712
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:02,449
we have the do mobile basically you

713
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:07,249
receive a text message with a code or

714
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:10,130
and your smartphone you have an alert

715
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:11,808
you receive an alert through the app and

716
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,749
you decide whether you want to accept or

717
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:17,569
not the connection then there's the

718
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:19,689
locking and then you have to wait and

719
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:22,099
see what happens

720
00:50:19,689 --> 00:50:24,920
another important thing that I like to

721
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:29,660
mention you need to hide or veil the

722
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:36,339
backend we can introduce the sentence I

723
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:40,368
don't know or we can we need to enhance

724
00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:49,660
security through hiding as I'd like to

725
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:55,849
say we can use of plugins we can change

726
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:58,578
the config WP config and this changes

727
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:02,089
the route for logging access we're

728
00:50:58,579 --> 00:51:05,869
trying to make the attacker slicer more

729
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:10,099
difficult recommendations about the

730
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:13,339
login 'm to limit login access why are

731
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:20,079
we going to keep the access active at 4

732
00:51:13,339 --> 00:51:26,299
a.m. what might happens after a good

733
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:29,599
night of partying and we might have the

734
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:32,749
urge to publish polemic things so this

735
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:35,719
is a limit against possible accesses why

736
00:51:32,749 --> 00:51:38,718
are we going to keep our login active

737
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:41,970
are we going to publish anything from 4

738
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:45,840
to 6 or why we'll work in

739
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:53,098
so we can just manage things with a

740
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:56,910
timetable limiting the access the access

741
00:51:53,099 --> 00:52:01,640
of countries that limit in the number of

742
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:01,640
countries that can access your WordPress

743
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:11,400
if my blog is poetry blog and it's

744
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:17,609
poetry in Spanish or in Catalan or

745
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:21,690
Galician Basque or Chinese citizens

746
00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:24,480
going to read my blog I don't think so

747
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:27,599
so why are we going to give access to

748
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:32,460
Chinese or Russians that do not speak

749
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:36,950
our language so we're going to limit and

750
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:39,630
the number of countries warfare does

751
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:45,899
this limitation although you have to pay

752
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:56,599
but also we have we can limited it in

753
00:52:45,900 --> 00:53:03,030
the HTC and to block tour we can use WP

754
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:07,320
multi so they don't access to the tour

755
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:13,080
plugs in that my really limit your

756
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:15,750
access WP martyr and a couple more there

757
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:19,259
are not too many that do a good job and

758
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:25,130
a hard way is to consult the list

759
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:30,320
published in internet about torah'

760
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:33,720
natural tour range and included in the

761
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:39,980
HTC file although if the file is too

762
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:43,279
large their performance might be

763
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,280
impacted by this

764
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,869
[Music]

765
00:53:44,739 --> 00:53:53,269
and I'm going to mention an article I

766
00:53:47,869 --> 00:53:57,979
published last year about limiting

767
00:53:53,269 --> 00:54:01,269
server access by IP table it was after a

768
00:53:57,979 --> 00:54:04,189
conversation I had with a good friend

769
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:07,098
that works at networking and a customer

770
00:54:04,189 --> 00:54:11,269
asked him if it would be possible to

771
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:14,209
block tor access access to the server

772
00:54:11,269 --> 00:54:17,959
from Torah not just an through website

773
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:20,538
but just to a server and he said that

774
00:54:17,959 --> 00:54:25,749
the manufacturer decent block this but

775
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:31,180
the users could not get outside the door

776
00:54:25,749 --> 00:54:34,279
it was difficult to implement an either

777
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:37,368
thought that this might have had an easy

778
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:45,439
solution using IP table you download the

779
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:49,670
sides you make a cron and you update the

780
00:54:45,439 --> 00:54:52,390
list you check them and you add this

781
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:55,999
information to the IP table every time

782
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:58,279
doors side wants to visit our site is

783
00:54:55,999 --> 00:55:01,488
just blocked and every three days a week

784
00:54:58,279 --> 00:55:07,459
or a month you can check the list or the

785
00:55:01,489 --> 00:55:10,880
IP addresses and you add the title of IP

786
00:55:07,459 --> 00:55:14,890
table it doesn't really need much time

787
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:18,619
and we can therefore protect our server

788
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:23,828
not only at the level of WordPress but

789
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:25,030
at the level of our IP be including

790
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:26,330
plugins

791
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:28,980
[Music]

792
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:38,000
here I could just devote a whole

793
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:42,240
presentation to the plugins a backup

794
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,390
plugins we need backups is going to save

795
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:50,240
our life in case of catastrophic event

796
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:57,330
if we want to limit the Grouse attacks

797
00:55:50,240 --> 00:56:03,500
we need attempts limit login attempts to

798
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:08,009
check the security of our WordPress

799
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:14,280
using ultimate security checker for spam

800
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:19,800
we have Jack Polk Ahmed they are very

801
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:28,820
useful WP audit log shows you or

802
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:32,700
monitors and shows users changes whether

803
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:34,520
they have 10 suppose 10 - the nickname

804
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:38,910
is very interesting it has a

805
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:41,820
professional version well the free one

806
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:44,790
is quite good and if we haven't had any

807
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:48,570
incident it provides good information

808
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:53,060
about security plugs in your fence and

809
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:58,190
those are free if we hire for buying

810
00:56:53,060 --> 00:57:05,130
some others they have a very effective

811
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:09,119
functionalities wordfence ITM he

812
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:10,950
protects from gross attacks and there

813
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:13,010
are some others that you can see in the

814
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,009
slide

815
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:26,099
a works with W a B for the host for

816
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:31,560
temporary users for giving them time for

817
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:34,260
example a year ninja a firewall

818
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:38,099
I didn't write very much but it goes

819
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:41,640
find and security has a very interesting

820
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:47,490
plug in Malta is also worth mentioning

821
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:52,710
to blocked or access and Google

822
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:58,470
reCAPTCHA that is the best of them but

823
00:57:52,710 --> 00:58:05,450
you have to be fill in many many forms

824
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:08,819
is quite a nightmare and cloud fear

825
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:14,669
against the Tor attacks if you want to

826
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:19,490
do a good job please invest by version

827
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:19,490
that might support many other things

828
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:28,859
here I say that the hosting is important

829
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:32,810
if we have a shared hosting or limited

830
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:37,500
hosting with limited resources if we

831
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:43,380
install plugins there will be memory

832
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:46,830
error so it's important to have a not to

833
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:49,800
use limited hosting we seduce a good one

834
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:53,210
we should pay the necessary money so

835
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,210
that we can use plugins

836
00:58:56,330 --> 00:59:05,810
another interesting plug-in head control

837
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:13,259
because it's not quite cryptic sometimes

838
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:19,360
we forget about it but there are plugins

839
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:21,670
that protect against KSS so that certain

840
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:24,270
attacks will not be realized we just

841
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:28,170
install this plugin and it activates

842
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:30,700
some headlines so that there are

843
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:37,390
different queries that are not allowed

844
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:42,220
only using HP ts protocol excuse me

845
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:46,330
HTTP protocol this is interesting we can

846
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:49,680
change it to a patent when we have

847
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:55,600
different workplaces in the same server

848
00:59:49,680 --> 01:00:02,850
this in relation to drugs in the

849
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:05,920
information tips now never think that

850
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:11,259
default settings are okay we should

851
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:15,660
always try to do the settings ourselves

852
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:20,310
and spend some time to not install

853
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:25,990
compliments outside the repository why

854
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:30,850
if you download for friends for free in

855
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:34,779
mediafire you know from a Russian forum

856
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:39,250
and they're quite interesting things

857
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:42,340
there I'm sure this is has some degree

858
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:44,670
of malware nobody gives anything for

859
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,670
free

860
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:52,319
do not install those things we are

861
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:54,540
risking an opening up potential entry

862
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:56,819
vectors which has analyzed the

863
01:00:54,540 --> 01:01:00,390
complements within their repositories

864
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:02,549
sometimes I don't remember about the

865
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:07,230
plugin but it was one that had the

866
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:11,190
malware they erase it they download the

867
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:17,089
plug-in again it is still feda malware

868
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:20,520
with a backdoor and up until four times

869
01:01:17,089 --> 01:01:23,910
they had to erase it and upload it again

870
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:28,079
and therefore a plugin that does not

871
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:32,490
have many iterations look for it there

872
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:34,500
isn't the reason why was time to do it

873
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:41,790
but it's important so be aware of

874
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:45,089
plugins or premium items this is my cost

875
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:47,849
eighty euros or dollars and I found

876
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:51,828
another one then it looks as interesting

877
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:58,309
but for half the price be aware of this

878
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:58,309
the use of robust passwords

879
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:05,900
and no matter how often we say how

880
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:09,760
important this is but robust passwords

881
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:13,490
are not always used wizard use limit

882
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:16,970
admin users there are different roles

883
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:19,149
and we have to limit this who is going

884
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:21,620
to manage who's going to be the admin

885
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:31,030
not everyone can be here

886
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:31,029
I mean user to take into account TOS

887
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:38,120
protection for performance and

888
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:41,270
availability if we're detecting an

889
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:44,060
attack we can access a panel in the

890
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:50,870
plug-in itself and we can activate their

891
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:56,170
read bottom as mono said we should take

892
01:02:50,870 --> 01:03:00,470
this into account if we want to protect

893
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:04,090
CDN whether we have a gos protection or

894
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:08,990
a better performance once we install

895
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:12,380
WordPress we shouldn't let it on its own

896
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:17,299
to self protect sometimes we need to do

897
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:23,570
I'm going audits and update things if we

898
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:28,010
are the only managers to have a periodic

899
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:29,630
audits this we might delayed we know if

900
01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:34,330
we have made changes if we have

901
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:37,430
introduced new files or new plugins but

902
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:40,670
if there is a same blog with different

903
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:45,049
managers is advisable and then update

904
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:47,680
plugins and what press releases almost

905
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:51,410
anybody doesn't and we should do it all

906
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:55,790
plugins are not updated because we fear

907
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:59,799
of breaking in our designs and WordPress

908
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:02,180
they say that may no longer work but

909
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:04,630
they're updating does not affect

910
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:09,790
anything you have

911
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:16,140
updated database in a backup then we

912
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:23,230
shouldn't fear updating the plugins and

913
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:28,330
why why all of this we see we don't

914
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:32,020
really see much of this screen but the

915
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:35,590
other day the black in Black Friday soda

916
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:41,110
account was just five dollars when the

917
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:46,660
user price is 49 he this is just another

918
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:51,460
but if you look for a soda I don't know

919
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:58,390
if you can see it better now yes if we

920
01:04:51,460 --> 01:05:00,880
look in soda this chain these makes

921
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:03,790
reference to a vulnerable plug in you

922
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:08,920
find 219 results if you search in Google

923
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:12,279
there will be many more you can index it

924
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:17,590
and somebody that is quite boring and

925
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:19,780
has nothing to do you can they can spend

926
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:22,830
that time it's a Friday night there's

927
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:22,830
nothing to do and

928
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:38,920
they see our site and they can attack

929
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:43,840
our WordPress site we can search for

930
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:48,520
this information for ip's ports and this

931
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:52,120
is a map this is a wonderful map for

932
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:58,450
representation but it doesn't really say

933
01:05:52,120 --> 01:06:00,460
much doesn't really give much

934
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:06,279
information than the previous slide but

935
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:10,000
it locates you you website in the map in

936
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:16,120
if we search in Google I don't know if

937
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:20,080
you can take in the screen position the

938
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:26,620
lens if you look for this you have half

939
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:32,160
a million results approximately five

940
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:36,549
hundred and fifty seven thousand indexes

941
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:39,850
and as you see this is just a

942
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:43,660
hypothetical example where a hacker is

943
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:50,440
bored and they wish to attack our

944
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:54,930
website and now his demo time all videos

945
01:06:50,440 --> 01:07:00,270
are recorded because the unit and life

946
01:06:54,930 --> 01:07:05,500
was more tricky and the first concept

947
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:12,670
test the use of a vulnerable plugin

948
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:19,290
we can download the files for example WP

949
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:22,660
comfy with this plugin the vulnerable

950
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:27,160
use of this plug-in is just through a

951
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:38,460
call Rd you are L we downloaded and is

952
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:38,460
as easy as this let us see now a demo

953
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:44,890
well the thought of something I do know

954
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:47,399
was a barnacle evasion enough and this

955
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:47,400
is not working

956
01:07:50,920 --> 01:08:04,270
again beneath the mihrab River

957
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:10,750
now the first the best as you see is in

958
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:14,620
a local server update WordPress now here

959
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:21,990
we have the vulnerable one there are

960
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:21,990
many even though it's a previous version

961
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:28,600
Thank You shell novice hunter even

962
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:36,910
though this version there are many sites

963
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:48,160
with this plugin for moving images of

964
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:50,649
pictures being our Alamo now we're gonna

965
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:57,880
look for the exploit in the database

966
01:08:50,649 --> 01:09:01,960
display I'm sorry from 2015 and I see

967
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:12,370
there are many different sites that are

968
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:15,279
vulnerable and with this URL through a

969
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:20,590
call we can download it is very very

970
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:29,019
easy now we're going to see what happens

971
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:34,319
the s file is downloaded I'm here I have

972
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:34,320
the database user and the password

973
01:09:34,509 --> 01:09:42,488
and I've said these are a lab but this

974
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:48,549
is in Internet is not something that

975
01:09:42,488 --> 01:09:54,129
I've just but I'm just presenting it's

976
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:57,220
something that is real the WP coffee is

977
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:59,110
going to be downloaded and all of this

978
01:09:57,220 --> 01:10:01,960
information is an Internet you cannot

979
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:04,719
test it because it's illegal but I've

980
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:08,610
done it and it's very easy you don't

981
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:13,920
have to be an expert here

982
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:18,120
[Music]

983
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:23,310
what I'm showing you is a plug-in that

984
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:23,309
says weather is vulnerable or not

985
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:31,800
Therese endo

986
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:45,040
no comprendo is checking if my wordpress

987
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:49,150
site is vulnerable or not when they say

988
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:54,190
venerable target or objective and then

989
01:10:49,150 --> 01:11:02,589
it brings the file WP comfy we did

990
01:10:54,190 --> 01:11:07,450
before manually with URL el sorry we can

991
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:10,840
now do it through a plug-in and it's the

992
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:15,120
same the same test but through different

993
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:24,400
pathways to alternatives therefore and

994
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:28,150
here I show you the whole process I we

995
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:31,420
could do it even life against one of our

996
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:40,308
websites but I'm not gonna do it I'm

997
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:43,579
gonna stop this demo here the first test

998
01:11:40,309 --> 01:11:48,710
as I said with the use of dread the

999
01:11:43,579 --> 01:11:53,599
slider there are numerous number of

1000
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:58,730
sites with this plugin and I'm sure that

1001
01:11:53,599 --> 01:12:04,400
they have oh they can download many

1002
01:11:58,730 --> 01:12:07,940
people's file the second test WordPress

1003
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:17,869
not plug-in now the WordPress one revela

1004
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:20,750
release that can modify an entry that is

1005
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:24,139
published already published they can

1006
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:29,119
just change it they can set a different

1007
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:37,480
picture write another article introduce

1008
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:45,619
me information I'm now going to show you

1009
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:50,539
the video with the second test this is

1010
01:12:45,619 --> 01:12:54,049
my WordPress website that is made for

1011
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:58,210
this presentation and what I'm doing is

1012
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:58,210
just loading the website

1013
01:13:02,489 --> 01:13:09,739
let's see the entry by default as a

1014
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:19,440
reference we see that there's nothing

1015
01:13:09,739 --> 01:13:24,780
there so we can go on okay this is just

1016
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:28,820
a test the see that the release is four

1017
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:28,820
point seven there are many in Google

1018
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:38,340
there is no longer in process they don't

1019
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:40,320
use those that are no longer in process

1020
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:43,770
and what press office information about

1021
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:48,929
this but we don't always take a notice

1022
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:58,310
to this another plug in there for plug

1023
01:13:48,930 --> 01:14:01,290
database this plugin in Titan analyzes

1024
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:04,050
it has different options one is to

1025
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:08,090
analyze the number of articles so that

1026
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:15,150
we choose the article we want to change

1027
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:17,930
obviously as I said before we can test

1028
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:20,940
this in our website to the region

1029
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:27,600
third-parties website is illegal don't

1030
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:30,080
even try because you can end up in

1031
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,080
trouble

1032
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:40,380
so you see the published pockets and the

1033
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:48,840
day some of the data is related to the

1034
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:53,730
ID of the article we want to change let

1035
01:14:48,840 --> 01:15:03,960
us write it in big letters this never

1036
01:14:53,730 --> 01:15:07,639
fails okay we call Python with the

1037
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:10,560
exploit will provide ID information

1038
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:14,130
about the article we're going to change

1039
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:19,700
we don't need privileges or anything we

1040
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:22,010
are a server level but we could be

1041
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:25,320
somewhere else

1042
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:29,670
here we're going to create a contents

1043
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:33,990
file this is going to be very important

1044
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:39,150
for the third concept test to change an

1045
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:42,070
article for example ad frame

1046
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:50,900
[Music]

1047
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:54,620
okay here the contents of what we are

1048
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:58,129
going to do you see the bust that was

1049
01:15:54,620 --> 01:16:04,070
modified and is now complete and let us

1050
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:10,520
check now if this is the case I love the

1051
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:15,019
page and I see the modification many

1052
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:26,840
sides were hugged because of this

1053
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:30,530
vulnerability here I also show this is

1054
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:39,400
quite complex but I am showing with this

1055
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:48,170
video the user number in with an enable

1056
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:51,290
recipe here the username test and there

1057
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:55,700
are many different active sites so I

1058
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:59,900
imagine that if we introduce this

1059
01:16:55,700 --> 01:17:03,019
information we can name the user this is

1060
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:08,330
another easy way when we're origin our

1061
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:12,100
website let us check if the users go and

1062
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:12,100
follow this process or some other

1063
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:26,530
again you're gonna hear I'd search

1064
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:41,720
nothing together than the possibility of

1065
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:47,590
going to search potential sites that may

1066
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:52,660
have Breanna and also in the EXIF

1067
01:17:47,590 --> 01:17:56,660
directory list there are many thousands

1068
01:17:52,660 --> 01:18:06,349
results although they are not limited to

1069
01:17:56,660 --> 01:18:12,590
WordPress Google Google search is very

1070
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:20,200
flexible when looking as you can see we

1071
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:24,380
have millions of director is 166 million

1072
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:27,530
results that have this obviously not all

1073
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:32,870
those millions are devoted to this or

1074
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:38,990
are in the cachet but are not active but

1075
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:43,660
only with having 1 million sites that

1076
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:49,119
would be important enough with index of

1077
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:52,820
this is the video or the demo

1078
01:18:49,119 --> 01:19:00,999
and I made reference to the fact of

1079
01:18:52,820 --> 01:19:00,999
updating and now I'm going to move to

1080
01:19:03,999 --> 01:19:18,820
the third test that's the most striking

1081
01:19:08,749 --> 01:19:21,530
about the third test let us have an XSS

1082
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:25,429
because it's the same vulnerability as

1083
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:31,219
WordPress 4.7 and through a half a kill

1084
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:34,730
we're going to insert them then

1085
01:19:31,219 --> 01:19:40,030
characters shell dots that are short and

1086
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:49,388
we're going to use the URL as a console

1087
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:49,389
but it has its problems

1088
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:53,890
[Music]

1089
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:28,430
first we're going to do an XSS we're

1090
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:30,830
going to use the same exploit but

1091
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:39,530
different content instead of a text

1092
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:41,930
we're going to use characters here what

1093
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:52,330
I'm teaching is that is empty there's

1094
01:20:41,930 --> 01:21:02,590
nothing there this is not a trick and

1095
01:20:52,330 --> 01:21:02,590
this is a real test here what we do is -

1096
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:08,959
[Music]

1097
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:13,040
we're gonna benefit from the fact that

1098
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:15,320
WordPress allows embedded children in

1099
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:18,590
some for some services for example

1100
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:20,150
YouTube if we add some other websites

1101
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:25,520
that is not on the white list of

1102
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:29,299
WordPress or that is not active to allow

1103
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:31,700
embedded code then we will not be able

1104
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:40,150
to do it therefore we're going to use

1105
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:46,370
YouTube's domain just as embedded code

1106
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:48,730
we work with this URL and what we do

1107
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,730
here

1108
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:55,750
is character bigger than which is a V

1109
01:21:57,010 --> 01:22:04,430
otherwise WordPress cannot follow the

1110
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:08,390
process and we're telling them then when

1111
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:12,050
the embedded code is loaded it should

1112
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:15,980
show an alert yet a ceremony will mean

1113
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:19,300
taken like carretera kabali okay we've

1114
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:26,169
got a character's capped cuz otherwise

1115
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:26,170
WordPress blocks this so we kept them

1116
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,040
save this

1117
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:46,660
so the content has been already uploaded

1118
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:49,440
with that line we uploaded we enter f5

1119
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:54,280
and here we are

1120
01:22:49,440 --> 01:23:01,480
so websites with four seven we can add

1121
01:22:54,280 --> 01:23:03,570
this we can send a screenshot ok here

1122
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:08,320
you can see that the code has been

1123
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:14,320
injected and as I'm saying this console

1124
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:18,610
is not related to the admin user now

1125
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:22,450
what we're going to do is exactly the

1126
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:26,380
same or well quite similar but we're

1127
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:31,260
going to inject malicious java screen

1128
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:36,450
script that makes a call malicious

1129
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:40,860
javascript is prompted and then

1130
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:40,860
injection some lines of code

1131
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:55,430
I could give up my fat so what are we

1132
01:23:52,520 --> 01:24:01,210
going to do here what am i doing rather

1133
01:23:55,430 --> 01:24:09,430
I'm going to convert that's pumped that

1134
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:12,950
JavaScript Crump and the idea is that

1135
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:17,060
we're not restricted by WordPress we're

1136
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:24,110
going to run the script it's a bit slow

1137
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:29,270
bear with us you can see the J s there

1138
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:33,070
it can be well any website in this case

1139
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:33,070
we saved it in the same server

1140
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:45,009
but we can make that prompt wherever we

1141
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:48,460
want and what we were doing and so you

1142
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:50,730
can see the malicious JavaScript is

1143
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,730
there

1144
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:12,210
we copy the conversion the entire

1145
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:14,400
Commission we close the quote greater

1146
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:21,500
than as a character or greater than as

1147
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:21,500
you can see and we save the content and

1148
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:37,900
there is a request of embedded code here

1149
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:42,139
you can see the malicious JavaScript

1150
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:44,360
this is published in the internet there

1151
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:49,970
are many JavaScript codes that can be

1152
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:58,130
used to injected in the shell but it's

1153
01:25:49,970 --> 01:26:03,980
one of the shortest ones and here in

1154
01:25:58,130 --> 01:26:06,740
this park starting here and this symbol

1155
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:09,019
before the question mark there you have

1156
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:16,400
the shell up until there okay

1157
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:19,960
up until the question mark a CMD this is

1158
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,960
a super short show

1159
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:32,190
you can go for a longer shell later on

1160
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:41,550
if Zissou ish but you can do virtually

1161
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:45,540
everything so we're going to inject the

1162
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:51,360
shell in the Hello Dolly popping which

1163
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:54,960
is a default plugging over WordPress and

1164
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:58,049
we can inject it there or in 404 errors

1165
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:01,429
and 404 errors because that can be your

1166
01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:01,429
act yes

1167
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:07,399
we can inject it

1168
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:13,558
[Music]

1169
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:20,099
and whatever file using the editor for

1170
01:27:13,559 --> 01:27:23,309
example 404 this is an interesting site

1171
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:26,510
that's where you can host it because you

1172
01:27:23,309 --> 01:27:26,510
can make the cool fat

1173
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:39,050
and it's quite interesting

1174
01:27:43,619 --> 01:27:52,419
and the content is content as J as

1175
01:27:47,979 --> 01:27:58,449
malicious that's the name we upload the

1176
01:27:52,419 --> 01:28:06,429
side something strange happens as you

1177
01:27:58,449 --> 01:28:09,388
can see connecting connecting this means

1178
01:28:06,429 --> 01:28:09,389
it's inserted

1179
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:25,289
and here as you can see

1180
01:28:27,329 --> 01:28:35,709
using the Hello Dolly plugging I entered

1181
01:28:31,239 --> 01:28:40,959
this and I obtained the directory where

1182
01:28:35,709 --> 01:28:44,199
it's hosted I'll introduce whatever

1183
01:28:40,959 --> 01:28:50,550
other command I can think about here we

1184
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:56,159
have the WP config I make the call and

1185
01:28:50,550 --> 01:29:03,189
the ideas to be able to view the files

1186
01:28:56,159 --> 01:29:09,098
the WH TTML can be used it can be VP

1187
01:29:03,189 --> 01:29:15,840
host and the idea is to make calls and

1188
01:29:09,099 --> 01:29:24,119
here you can see part of the WP config

1189
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:24,119
code out key etc

1190
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:39,840
and now I'm going to show you the

1191
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:43,440
password file PC password we're using

1192
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:48,989
the i-team as a console this is what

1193
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:51,960
this shell allows us to do we're just

1194
01:29:48,989 --> 01:29:57,089
listing routes we can see you'll review

1195
01:29:51,960 --> 01:30:00,380
the users it's just a matter of using

1196
01:29:57,090 --> 01:30:00,380
your imagination

1197
01:30:08,249 --> 01:30:13,780
I'm going to exes once again my

1198
01:30:12,219 --> 01:30:17,650
WordPress site

1199
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:19,780
I see that it's not loading and as an

1200
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:22,150
admin I'm gonna try to see what's

1201
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:26,710
happening to know what happened with my

1202
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:32,499
article so what I'm doing now is once I

1203
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:36,400
obtain the shell I send an empty file to

1204
01:30:32,499 --> 01:30:42,280
read edit the post because I've already

1205
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:46,150
done the injection the hello dad HP is

1206
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:49,659
already injected I don't want the site

1207
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:51,699
to suspect this could be programmed in

1208
01:30:49,659 --> 01:30:53,228
the same script in order not to repeat

1209
01:30:51,699 --> 01:30:56,530
this process and you can see that

1210
01:30:53,229 --> 01:31:05,019
there's nothing there because inserted

1211
01:30:56,530 --> 01:31:10,150
an empty content so I use version 4.7 to

1212
01:31:05,019 --> 01:31:14,440
insert a shell in WordPress and now you

1213
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:16,889
may ask me well it is super important

1214
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:20,280
you take a look

1215
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:23,010
I'm logged in as an administrator I've

1216
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:28,200
clicked on the link being an

1217
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:31,260
administrator so I have the power to

1218
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:33,960
edit code as an administrator should I

1219
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:36,900
not be an administrator I wouldn't be

1220
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:42,030
able to edit hello dot HP I don't have

1221
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:44,879
the authorization required to edit this

1222
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:48,800
so other users so wouldn't have the site

1223
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,800
loaded and wouldn't be able to do this

1224
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:58,170
let's imagine that this is very visited

1225
01:31:56,490 --> 01:32:03,200
site and people start saying that it's

1226
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:08,250
not working that has crashed that and

1227
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:10,470
when those comments are posted because I

1228
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:14,610
mean some websites need to have a high

1229
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:17,480
availability and if there are down times

1230
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:22,110
of let's say 10 minutes people start

1231
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:29,000
complaining right away they will click

1232
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:33,630
on the link over and over again so and

1233
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:36,930
the end men users has logged in or could

1234
01:32:33,630 --> 01:32:42,290
have log in to provide visitors with the

1235
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:45,290
link so as a result this problem would

1236
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:45,290
escalate

1237
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:10,719
if it's not a highly visited side.we or

1238
01:33:05,019 --> 01:33:13,780
rather the attacker will send an email

1239
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:18,369
to different addresses to say that the

1240
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:23,380
site is not protected he would launch

1241
01:33:18,369 --> 01:33:27,989
perhaps some fishing and campaign and of

1242
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:27,989
course the console needs to be located

1243
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:36,089
you would have to conduct forensic

1244
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:40,599
analysis you know where he has access to

1245
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:44,289
restore and if we restore the version if

1246
01:33:40,599 --> 01:33:45,909
we restore backup from the previous day

1247
01:33:44,289 --> 01:33:48,099
or the previous week or the previous

1248
01:33:45,909 --> 01:33:50,259
month and we continue with the same

1249
01:33:48,099 --> 01:33:59,760
version while we're going to be attacked

1250
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:59,760
again and this should work

1251
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:09,280
[Music]

1252
01:34:04,019 --> 01:34:10,149
so this is my small tribute to Chiquita

1253
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:15,209
Licata

1254
01:34:10,149 --> 01:34:20,649
and here are a list of interesting

1255
01:34:15,209 --> 01:34:27,429
references I like to introduce luck

1256
01:34:20,649 --> 01:34:28,239
wares and if you work in this field a

1257
01:34:27,429 --> 01:34:31,239
wesp

1258
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:36,669
is wonderful it's true they're doing the

1259
01:34:31,239 --> 01:34:40,058
controls is a bore it's very cumbersome

1260
01:34:36,669 --> 01:34:46,599
but it works very well it works very

1261
01:34:40,059 --> 01:34:49,749
well the deed hub of cake code then

1262
01:34:46,599 --> 01:34:51,849
Danny and Mauro another plugin that I

1263
01:34:49,749 --> 01:34:55,629
mentioned earlier it's very interesting

1264
01:34:51,849 --> 01:35:00,429
impactor calm that explains pretty

1265
01:34:55,629 --> 01:35:03,610
clearly how we can modify an article

1266
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:06,760
which is what I did earlier there you

1267
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:10,058
can have also or you can see an

1268
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:14,619
interesting reference another article

1269
01:35:10,059 --> 01:35:18,039
that I wrote on CSL certificates in a

1270
01:35:14,619 --> 01:35:23,619
cloud fair for subdomains because there

1271
01:35:18,039 --> 01:35:27,478
are some problems that github code

1272
01:35:23,619 --> 01:35:31,808
cannot cover

1273
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:39,360
so for subdomains this is a good

1274
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:42,579
reference paper and we will have to use

1275
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:48,369
certificates and this article explains

1276
01:35:42,579 --> 01:35:49,199
how to do this with well without much

1277
01:35:48,369 --> 01:35:51,870
difficulty

1278
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:56,460
little team and then the article I

1279
01:35:51,870 --> 01:36:01,199
mentioned earlier regarding how we can

1280
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:03,960
block access to our server it's also

1281
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:06,290
very simple and straightforward it's a

1282
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:09,690
matter of reading the article in an hour

1283
01:36:06,290 --> 01:36:16,650
you'll have four clear ideas how it's

1284
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:18,839
done and acknowledges has are often

1285
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:20,879
mentioned at the beginning I left them

1286
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:23,280
for the end I like to thank the Spanish

1287
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,600
national cybersecurity Institute in Cuba

1288
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:26,849
for inviting me to make this

1289
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:29,910
presentation I like to thank my

1290
01:36:26,850 --> 01:36:32,370
colleagues from the Google to Baku I say

and share I love this idea

1298
01:36:53,820 --> 01:37:00,360
learn hackers share share and share it's

1299
01:36:57,690 --> 01:37:03,178
all about sharing because that's how we

1300

01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:36,860
afternoon answer very fast but don't ask

1312
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:39,720
me how to hack whatsapp or Facebook

1313
01:37:36,860 --> 01:37:41,820
because should I know how to do that I

1314
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:52,500
wouldn't be here so if you have any

1315
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:55,110
questions questions yeah hello you were

1316
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:59,430
saying earlier that one of the things we

1317
01:37:55,110 --> 01:38:02,309
can do is limit access from different

1318
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:06,150
countries to our website do you know if

1319
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:08,520
we can limit access to specific URLs for

1320
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:13,280
example I can limit access only to the

1321
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:18,480
admin area another public site yes in HT

1322
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:21,090
access that's an option HT access allows

1323
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:24,209
you to park a specific IP or to do Y

1324
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:26,400
lists and only an IP can access there or

1325
01:38:24,210 --> 01:38:29,430
a range of IPs can access there that's

1326
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:33,349
also an option yes what listing and in

1327
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:33,350
HP X as you can submit

1328
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:41,280
it can't be done I haven't explained

1329
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:42,780
that but HP axis gives you that

1330
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:45,960
functionality you need to you know

1331
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:48,120
tinker with it for a while but you can

1332
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:52,550
train it and that's an option it's quite

1333
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:55,800
flexible it's tool any further questions

1334
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:59,450
shoot I don't know you can ask whatever

1335
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:05,280
you wish you can ask about the trees

1336
01:38:59,450 --> 01:39:08,450
loved trains you have any questions

1337
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,450
please please be

1338
01:39:17,140 --> 01:39:23,260
well this isn't a question on trains by

1339
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:26,930
the way you said earlier that there are

1340
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:31,850
costing companies that are better others

1341
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:36,620
that are worse I have some websites and

1342
01:39:31,850 --> 01:39:40,030
my company but says it's with weights I

1343
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:43,809
work some are in a one-on-one basis

1344
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:46,490
others and arses and those are point

1345
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:49,400
problematic the site crown websites are

1346
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:57,800
not as problematic what companies and

1347
01:39:49,400 --> 01:40:01,940
your opinion are better well I wouldn't

1348
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:07,340
put my stakes on a new company none

1349
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:10,419
absolutely no company sure that I like

1350
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:10,420
some more than others

1351
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:19,010
well those that could have a better name

1352
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:26,180
v8 but we know that VH crashed and you

1353
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:29,870
have a second I can't hear you I'm

1354
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:33,950
afraid side ground side ground the

1355
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:38,660
answer Graham node had an attack ad EOS

1356
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:41,540
a denial of service attack I'm a bit

1357
01:40:38,660 --> 01:40:43,479
disconnected these days here companies

1358
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:48,369
let me think

1359
01:40:43,479 --> 01:40:51,849
the age it's pretty interesting of

1360
01:40:48,369 --> 01:40:58,299
course there are some robic drawbacks to

1361
01:40:51,849 --> 01:41:01,590
it Stratos Stratos Stratos is another

1362
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:07,469
interesting company it's quite

1363
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:10,840
interesting I don't want to you know do

1364
01:41:07,469 --> 01:41:17,320
advertising for these companies Stratos

1365
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:20,729
has some good options but also some

1366
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:24,759
there are some caveats to it as well I

1367
01:41:20,729 --> 01:41:27,459
don't want to put other companies we

1368
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:33,400
there's this very famous company that we

1369
01:41:27,459 --> 01:41:35,429
all use but I'm afraid the service this

1370
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:39,579
company provides is pretty flawed

1371
01:41:35,429 --> 01:41:41,709
there's much room for improvement and

1372
01:41:39,579 --> 01:41:43,599
I'm not only referring to security I'm

1373
01:41:41,709 --> 01:41:48,039
also referring to availability i'ma

1374
01:41:43,599 --> 01:41:51,190
francium the technical support it's

1375
01:41:48,039 --> 01:41:55,949
quite flawed but I know it's hard to

1376
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:59,589
mitigate targeted the OS attacks and

1377
01:41:55,949 --> 01:42:03,249
this is the result of the activities

1378
01:41:59,590 --> 01:42:08,139
performed by many botnets so I wouldn't

1379
01:42:03,249 --> 01:42:12,209
recommend one company specifically I

1380
01:42:08,139 --> 01:42:14,889
have this website that used our sis

1381
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:17,170
there's this other company bird match

1382
01:42:14,889 --> 01:42:17,889
from the US I believe that's quite

1383
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:20,079
interesting

1384
01:42:17,889 --> 01:42:23,829
some companies perhaps are not that

1385
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:27,849
famous but and can offer better services

1386
01:42:23,829 --> 01:42:30,639
than major companies but I wouldn't put

1387
01:42:27,849 --> 01:42:33,130
my cigs on any of them VH yes we've

1388
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:40,170
mentioned V ace is a good company I mean

1389
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:40,170
it's not great but it's pretty good

1390
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:48,490
I said I'm afraid I can say I can't

1391
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:53,450
provide you with further info any

1392
01:42:48,490 --> 01:43:00,590
additional comments or questions no you

1393
01:42:53,450 --> 01:43:02,690
can of course contact me and I can fight

1394
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:06,010
you with a copy of my presentation I

1395
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:12,759
imagine they'll upload it on the website

1396
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:12,760
you can have access to it okay

1397
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:28,420
I'll upload my presentation via Twitter

1398
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:34,120
as suggested but if I forget please

1399
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:36,969
remind me by a Twitter I mean I have the

1400
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:41,590
cameras as witness well thank you very

1401
01:43:36,969 --> 01:43:46,920
much for attending some of you have had

1402
01:43:41,590 --> 01:43:46,920
to stand up but that's what happens

1403
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,180
you
