00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:42,989
Spain and we know more about trapeze

597

00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:04,950
names during a course that we had with

602
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:09,200
cloud providers said that always commit

from 10:00 to 1:00 garden the CPUs okay

604
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:16,870
we have a lot to offer at all but this

605
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,910
was a provider for IP voice and we said

[Music]

607
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:25,359
sometimes the customers complain ten to

one invoice ID

609
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,130
a little too much let's go back to the

610
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,600
cloud service especially the part I

611
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,070
prefer the services that are not free

612
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:40,029
what is the cost of the cloud service

613
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:42,880
depends my hotmail my gmail my Facebook

614

can Protomen account not that one now

616
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:57,850
that we don't pay we don't pay in money

617
00:35:52,830 --> 00:36:00,880
people say is free of charge

618
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:04,210
well you are the product of course so

619
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:08,040
what we do in privacy has it of course

620
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:11,650
people are is not aware of privacy I

621
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,779
have nothing to hide and I say to them

622
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:15,520
you don't have anything to hide but when

623
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:18,430
you go to the toilet you close the door

624
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,280
that's something to hide and it's that

625
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:24,310
simple we are able to sacrifice a lot

626
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:30,910
part of our lives because we don't give

627
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:32,710
it a real value but it has value Vantage

628
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:35,109
of cloud computing and this type of

629
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:37,330
infrastructures is the orchestration

630
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:44,910
these are panels where we can program

631
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:47,710
all the needs to the number of customers

632
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:50,230
large in a very elastic way all the

633
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:53,740
resources all reduced so I say I only

634
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:56,320
have this tube thing then I can go back

635
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:59,350
to the free program but I'm going to

636
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,590
lose customers so I prefer to pay

637
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:05,440
[Music]

638
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:08,380
computing great adaption level and comes

639
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:14,050
because it helps to save money we pay

640
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:16,870
more at the end of the day they more as

641
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:19,600
the Geiger price price per Ram price per

642
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:21,430
Geiger Burress of the price per CPU but

643
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:26,650
we don't pay for the physical

644
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:29,379
infrastructure so we is in a better

645
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:31,980
position because we exchange them from

646
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:35,460
somewhere budget operational

647
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:38,910
budget and gives more value to precisely

648
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:41,030
that's the difference biggest difference

649
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,710
between cloud and traditional systems

650
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:45,720
the traditional systems I have the

651
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,119
equipment's if I need more I have to

652
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:54,390
invest a lot of money in hardware but in

653
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:59,819
cloud computing remotely with more

654
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:06,720
people so it's interesting this allows

655
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:10,950
us to play with mobile telephone bill we

656
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,540
can add one more clicker footage happen

657
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:17,839
so that's the only thing we need to do

658
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:19,410
most important thing here though is the

659
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:25,920
8020 rule

660
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:29,430
turnaround expenditure in hardware the

661
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,109
investment to keep it up and do maintain

662
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,328
it and now we're spending more in

663
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:37,859
operation in the past we had an IT

664
00:38:33,329 --> 00:38:43,549
person fixing the print fixing the

665
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:46,380
desktops and sometimes they invite to

666
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:47,970
repair others and machines in there in

667
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,690
the company now this personnel is

668
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:53,520
changed people are dealing with our data

669
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,200
security and these people are giving us

670
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,420
more value but they're not repairing

671
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:03,779
printers any Massimo's and instead of a

672
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:07,170
fixed investment in our infrastructure

673
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:09,030
we have a recurrent expenditure so once

674
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:13,380
we can't maintain it because it doesn't

675
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:15,750
work would you say to pay less we decide

676
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,250
to have less number of safe men because

677
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:28,950
the works doesn't work because you're

678
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:32,640
not selling so then a machine a machine

679
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:35,058
where you buy soda you pay every time

680
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,098
you need a bottle so what time our

681
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:39,949
infrastructures

682
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:42,679
we'll being included in some services to

683
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:46,969
manage their services there is one

684
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:50,089
Netflix what about Netflix is this

685
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:51,919
traditional what is this traditional iti

686
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:56,179
don't can't imagine what this company

687
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:59,328
has Netflix more particularly is the

688
00:39:56,179 --> 00:40:01,539
giant for the cloud consumers

689
00:39:59,329 --> 00:40:05,599
it's a giant company they have no

690
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:11,359
singles physical servers everything is

691
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:14,900
hired to third parties in the data

692
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,569
centers they send network equipment they

693
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:21,529
only install network equipment once

694
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:23,959
their other customers go down or well

695
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:25,579
there's a part of the services that is

696
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:28,069
cancelled but they just deal with

697
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:29,900
functionality Netflix is the big

698
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:32,058
revolution in cloud computing not just

699
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,509
as a provider but as a consumer and it's

700
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:37,640
a provider for SAS especially so that we

701
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:40,819
can sell our products and services and

702
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:44,058
did they have revolutionized the

703
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:46,869
security market the bit hub there are

704
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:50,089
placate ifs to check all the Amazon

705
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:55,069
instances that's incredible and this is

706
00:40:50,089 --> 00:41:01,339
very good let's concentrate on what we

707
00:40:55,069 --> 00:41:05,979
have if I'm not wrong you said that in

708
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:10,219
this graph if I come from down to top

709
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:14,538
you have more and more visibility from

710
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:16,489
above so if you are a consumer of IAS

711
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:19,099
but for structure you can see the layer

712
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:23,089
in pass and you can see what is the SAS

713
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:26,179
platform this software that end-users

714
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:29,749
use so you can see it from down beneath

715
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:32,959
is that true what it means that if you

716
00:41:29,749 --> 00:41:35,359
have the past platform if the behind it

717
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:38,058
there's a SAS they will have access to

718
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:42,019
my data no problem with that no problem

719
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:44,359
if you have the infrastructures have the

720
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:46,819
access to anything on top of them is

721
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:48,089
there a limitation can we protect

722
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:53,308
ourselves

723
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:57,150
well it depends the technician isn't it

724
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:59,880
a privilege escalation brings you from a

725
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,390
sass to a past platform but nobody does

726
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:06,689
that

727
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:11,009
no it shouldn't be done well I'll I take

728
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:13,319
note I'll see if it's true I'm suppose I

729
00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:14,939
can take his snapshots or one of the

730
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:17,939
virtual machines that we have around us

731
00:42:14,939 --> 00:42:22,578
and I want to know if I can extract

732
00:42:17,939 --> 00:42:27,749
something from that let's test it is ass

733
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:30,449
in sass what are these services

734
00:42:27,749 --> 00:42:34,828
well software-as-a-service lots of

735
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:38,400
services Facebook Amazon Google anything

736
00:42:34,829 --> 00:42:41,160
that we use every day and we're not able

737
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,059
to leave it in sass we can even talk

738
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:48,839
about whatsapp in this platform as a

739
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:51,349
service for developers this is great yes

740
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:55,769
in the room can you can you recognise

741
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:58,229
anything that is not canonical we have a

742
00:42:55,769 --> 00:43:02,098
developer in the room thank you a great

743
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:07,499
advantage if we want to create our next

744
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:09,239
super epic Asian and if we don't we have

745
00:43:07,499 --> 00:43:11,339
the necessary resources we have no

746
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:13,499
funding we have no investors and we know

747
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:15,509
that our application will work but we

748
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:17,218
need a lot of resources in a limited

749
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:19,979
time to test this functionality will

750
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:24,509
have no money for drives for RAM memory

751
00:43:19,979 --> 00:43:26,249
or for a network for a DRS we can go

752
00:43:24,509 --> 00:43:30,179
back to with the words of our great fry

753
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:33,479
and we need to buy more resources shut

754
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:35,670
up and scale my app within those we have

755
00:43:33,479 --> 00:43:39,948
the infrastructure as a service the

756
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:42,929
typical provider who and where that's

757
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:45,150
important in there are changes in our

758
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:46,859
legislation we want to know in which

759
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,859
country and which region we want to

760
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:53,308
operate that's important this type of

761
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:55,259
services according to the type of data

762
00:43:53,309 --> 00:43:57,650
you have to control it especially with

763
00:43:55,259 --> 00:44:00,859
the new data protection regulations the

764
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:06,470
responsibility is though

765
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:08,450
you been a level you are responsible you

766
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,730
have to be careful with us you can be

767
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:16,279
the person responsible for that the

768
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:19,279
great difference between virtualization

769
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:22,660
and this and that's in cloud computing

770
00:44:19,279 --> 00:44:24,710
it's not only there is a hypervisors of

771
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,670
calculation of computation the most

772
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:32,869
technical part of this data centers

773
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:36,950
within a single machine we can have an

774
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:40,089
infinity of operative systems and

775
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:44,239
individual machines you can have your

776
00:44:40,089 --> 00:44:49,910
operative systems we mount a server we

777
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:52,519
mount a rating system and then now we

778
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:55,160
have an intermediate intermediate layer

779
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:58,118
which is hyper vision with all the

780
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,609
operating systems resources plus our

781
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:04,039
applications we can create virtual

782
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:05,749
applications that would compound a set

783
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:08,839
of virtual machines serving a purpose

784
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:11,419
it's important to know this because in

785
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:14,119
the past we lost the control of an

786
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:18,170
application and it we became a server

787
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:20,749
here we can lose the control of virtual

788
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:26,359
container and we lose all the services

789
00:45:20,749 --> 00:45:30,879
behind one of the most important parts

790
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:34,308
of cloud infrastructures is storage

791
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,130
there's a full branch in data centers

792
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:41,230
there specialist special specialists in

793
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:44,809
storage providing the necessary space

794
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:47,900
there brands that are we show here are

795
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:51,249
the most popular we not pay for that

796
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:53,779
that's a pity and the types of storage

797
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:57,078
well they're different we need to know

798
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:59,480
why we used these types the object

799
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:02,529
storage everything is put into a

800
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:07,339
database and each object in particular

801
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:11,749
in another file in one owner another

802
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:13,070
hypervisor the most common is blue

803
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:18,560
server s

804
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:21,680
SEF if you know it then we have the

805
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,520
storage by files we've always used that

806
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:27,980
and vs but we have another one it's

807
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:33,020
block storage we have a critical

808
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:35,630
application okay and it it needs a

809
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:38,720
dedicated resource we use a block for

810
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:41,270
storage there are eight ten well you

811
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,029
would use a fourth of this rate ten for

812
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:46,910
us which sub will start to subdivide the

813
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:50,480
drives for a block for ourselves it's

814
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:53,660
just for applications that require a lot

815
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,140
of space in disks in database we can

816
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:59,810
have storages or in in devices in

817
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,850
different countries yes in blocks what

818
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:05,270
Notley for the others so I can ask you

819
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:08,180
respond for you I don't have any legal

820
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:10,430
responsibility if I extract data well it

821
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,520
depends on your tools but the provider

822
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:18,279
will never collaborate with you today

823
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:21,590
we've tried to ask FTP logs from hosting

824
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:26,780
providers and it was impossible we can't

825
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:28,670
show you in the Gib Gib habit that we're

826
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:31,370
going to open next week for these tools

827
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:36,880
and this presentation will be there

828
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:40,819
we'll give you a censored email with

829
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,920
conversations with providers saying what

830
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:44,840
is the color of an orange that's a

831
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:49,210
question typical questions for first

832
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:52,520
supplier and the engine for steam

833
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:56,660
propelling so you asked for a log and

834
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:58,790
they just answer do you want

835
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:01,460
more services from us of course you've

836
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:04,550
seen that in all type of services as

837
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:07,040
Claudia said there's zero collaboration

838
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:09,020
with providers and I suppose it's their

839
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,230
business because they need to protect

840
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:15,470
their intimacy and the data integrity of

841
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:17,690
their customers and there's a multiple

842
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:20,419
usage of that and they're not going to

843
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:23,060
allow me to access a log that comes with

844
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:25,340
many other things at the same time so

845
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,930
don't wait for that for that data

846
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,569
guarantee because

847
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:32,618
you're not going to have any reply the

848
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:36,589
great cloud revolution is brought by the

849
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:40,309
Sdn networks if you spoke about yacek

850
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:43,700
and crypto currency this is used for

851
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:46,640
crypto currency and for hash generation

852
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,700
with no network virtualization it works

853
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:52,368
fine these are microchip chips that are

854
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:55,640
designed for a specific purpose from

855
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:59,319
crypto currency they go back to network

856
00:48:55,640 --> 00:49:03,950
virtualization it's a fantastic

857
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:06,319
integration for a sec in operation

858
00:49:03,950 --> 00:49:10,009
instead of having the core with 30

859
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:14,119
fibers we have a virtual instance with

860
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:18,289
the NS applicative and we needed a

861
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:20,690
specialized equipment now it's simple if

862
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:24,260
I need to make an investigation it's

863
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:26,900
easier to duplicate Labs then have them

864
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:30,980
physically with me what's interesting in

865
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:35,990
the Sdn networks when we do an IP

866
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:38,480
tracing we get to the data center we can

867
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:41,629
go there we know in which data center we

868
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:45,460
are because we are traced routing and we

869
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:48,380
get to X number of suppliers we know

870
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:51,740
that we got we've come through the X

871
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:55,609
node the X hub and we know it's in Spain

872
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:59,419
we know in Amazon us we know where we

873
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:04,880
are in this type of networks you have

874
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:07,130
the bidding where traffic is exchanging

875
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,660
in that transparent way between supplies

876
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,599
but in fact the package is not here it's

877
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:15,319
in Germany in milliseconds it's not here

878
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:17,690
so this trace tracing system is a bit

879
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:19,730
complex not only complex in many

880
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:22,069
investigations that we can make when

881
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:25,130
tracing up a communication this this

882
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:28,910
means it's full of errors it's

883
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:30,680
interesting the load balancing is

884
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:35,240
fundamental have many projects to do

885
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:37,279
this load balancers maybe you don't want

886
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:40,430
to hear that but our internet providers

887
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:43,110
use load balances

888
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:47,580
do you know about our Reuters

889
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:49,260
information exchange it's kind of a

890
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:51,900
single mesh a single machine can not

891
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,880
store all those data and had to have all

892
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:58,740
this traffic they distribute it between

893
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:01,740
the various machines and here the most

894
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:03,870
important bottoms are the database of

895
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,879
service the Oracle license is very

896
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:10,650
expensive other technologies are quite

897
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:14,670
expensive so what do we do we hire a

898
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:16,500
portion of a database to a provider for

899
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:21,020
a monthly payment which is not very

900
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:21,020
expensive so avoid the great investment

901
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:28,740
so the question is to cloud or not to

902
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:34,680
cloud I think my infrastructure to the

903
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:36,930
cloud or not I can assess that it's if

904
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:40,049
if your infrastructure is your business

905
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:43,230
core don't put it into the cloud you

906
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:45,480
your core cannot go to a cloud that is

907
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:49,260
shared with many people you have to

908
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,940
assess the risks that are associated to

909
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,490
change your infrastructure or put it

910
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,970
into the hands of other people whose

911
00:51:53,490 --> 00:52:00,750
others because the cloud model is a

912
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:03,600
collaborative economic system so we

913
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,520
think we have a product where there's

914
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,980
provider but the provider has not all

915
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,170
the resources so it's been shared with

916
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,510
the resources are shared with Amazon or

917
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:15,210
with another company so what I need to

918
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:18,270
know is that is that if I have to use

919
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:21,090
cloud computing computer I need a way to

920
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:23,460
administrate what's happening in my

921
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:26,370
cloud yes you need a well-defined plan

922
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:29,400
for risks compliance security and

923
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:32,069
hardware you need to define these plans

924
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,690
you need a lot of meetings many

925
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:36,180
questions to your provider and very

926
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:39,420
uncomfortable questions so let's imagine

927
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,810
I take my infrastructure to the to the

928
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:45,390
clouds what do I need

929
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:49,799
it's an outsourced service external

930
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:51,990
service that you need to reap we locate

931
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,260
your personnel doesn't mean to put them

932
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:56,500
on the dole but this

933
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:58,690
personnel had about all the knowledge

934
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,100
about your physical infrastructures but

935
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:05,980
they know what happens to a piece of

936
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:07,000
data from A to Z this your personnel

937
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,650
know everything about your

938
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,560
infrastructure so you have to relocate

939
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:15,490
those people this person knows all the

940
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:18,190
the route that data follow so you have

941
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:23,109
to put your business meetings and you

942
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:24,760
have to have new ARP tool or workflows

943
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:26,920
that are more adapted to the new

944
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,970
infrastructure you're going to have so

945
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:33,190
we reallocate resources so I take my

946
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:36,160
infrastructure to the cloud and it's

947
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:40,030
true that I have to replace and relocate

948
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:44,259
my people and I don't know who and maybe

949
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:45,760
they're going to have a influence on my

950
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:48,070
infrastructure you need training

951
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,640
training and more training I I do I

952
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:53,830
agree

953
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:57,100
now we get to your favorite part so I

954
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:59,619
think now we know what the cloud is how

955
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:07,080
we can move around what are the risks

956
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:07,080
that we haven't imagined how can we now

957
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:13,180
avoid those risks so what are the risks

958
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:17,350
that we're going to be faced with first

959
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:19,359
the loss of governance it's clear the

960
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:21,910
provider is going to control what you do

961
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:24,369
I can't control anything and that's a

962
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:27,160
loss of Governors and it's a risk how

963
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:30,310
can I solve this risk well I have to

964
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:34,450
trust him I have to trust the contracts

965
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:36,820
that I sign weather provider ok let's

966
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:44,140
imagine this is a case of a provider I'm

967
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:47,380
not going to name they sell they sold IP

968
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:50,770
voice services and they close their

969
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:54,790
service and everything lost the fixed

970
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:57,150
the land telephone number so

971
00:54:54,790 --> 00:55:01,000
disappearance of telephone numbers

972
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:03,640
another risk in this especially linked

973
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,320
to the price it's not the same to pay

974
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,670
for a service for and for another

975
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,100
service if I have to

976
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:12,460
my grave the content in my own the cloud

977
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:15,720
to another place what are the services

978
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:18,790
that are offered to me if it was like

979
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:21,279
telephones do I have the possibility to

980
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:24,009
leave you because I have all the data

981
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,710
can I can I leave my provider at any

982
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:28,570
moment in time you I need freedom and

983
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:31,270
you have to be careful with those

984
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:36,430
services yes there's a risk there are

985
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:39,550
two questions there what is the

986
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:42,790
technology that we use the vendor log we

987
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:44,770
are forced to use this vendor with the

988
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:46,390
same technology or can we migrate and

989
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:50,410
choose another vendor with another

990
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:53,080
technology and the providers artistic

991
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:55,299
honesty but all providers are honest if

992
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,980
I say dramas and I want to take all the

993
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,320
services to another place yes of course

994
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,870
so you can do it well Amazon has a

995
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:05,920
specific policy it's quite serious it's

996
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:07,380
quite ok and honest that's normal that's

997
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:12,130
usual no it's not

998
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:16,240
ok so careful with that another risk the

999
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:19,150
the you can't be isolated when using the

1000
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:21,490
shared resources during the our talk we

1001
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:23,950
said that shared resources are going to

1002
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:26,040
be violated on many occasions it's not

1003
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:29,830
the same to have a provider or supplier

1004
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:33,100
ensuring that that don't have anybody

1005
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:34,810
there it's like having all the share

1006
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:37,990
resources and anybody can have access to

1007
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:40,480
that it's one of the risks yes there

1008
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,430
were specific failure in Amazon but

1009
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,500
there was a fault from one instance you

1010
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:47,290
could have access to hypervisors you

1011
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:51,970
could have an Amazon virtual machine

1012
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:53,710
with faults and errors the buffer

1013
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:56,859
overflow allowed you to have access to

1014
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:58,600
all the machines that were we were were

1015
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,460
under the same hypervisor at the same

1016
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:03,190
time there was a programming problem

1017
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:05,200
there and it could be a catastrophe you

1018
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:07,690
can have access to anything in that

1019
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,649
strangers some another risk is

1020
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:15,310
compliance compliance the provider not

1021
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:17,890
only has to demonstrate to me that he

1022
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:20,170
that he has has the necessary resources

1023
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:23,710
has to allow me to make an

1024
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:26,049
audit tell me what you want but I want

1025
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:29,290
to check that it's true why because when

1026
00:57:26,049 --> 00:57:32,770
I have to comply by the law to abide by

1027
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:35,950
the law here I'm responsible for that so

1028
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:37,960
yeah this is not respected in many cases

1029
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:45,910
it's one of the highest risks that I can

1030
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:49,869
face that's interesting more risks and I

1031
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:51,640
suppose that you know that you can might

1032
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:54,599
be mining bitcoins without knowing it

1033
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:59,078
you don't know it the JavaScript systems

1034
00:57:54,599 --> 00:58:01,599
are continuously mining bitcoins any

1035
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:03,460
management interface that is accessible

1036
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:10,950
through the internet can be vulnerable

1037
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:13,569
everything is preferable so I'm plus I

1038
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:15,129
have the Browse browsers all around me

1039
00:58:13,569 --> 00:58:17,319
for my customers and they are all

1040
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:19,480
vulnerable I found one of these

1041
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:21,759
vulnerabilities and the FBI discovered

1042
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:24,069
people in a in a Thor Network because

1043
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,940
there was a Firefox vulnerability in the

1044
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:29,589
Tor system so maybe I don't need to

1045
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,819
update the systems and thanks to that

1046
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:35,589
I'm going to have a vulnerability that

1047
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:38,230
so that through my computer and through

1048
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:40,720
my web systems people are going to

1049
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:44,819
access to all the my company's resources

1050
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,819
that's not very nice is it

1051
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:56,290
we need to adapt to the laws to abide by

1052
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:59,290
the laws and regulations and I insist

1053
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:02,740
you have to ask your provider the real

1054
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:07,119
proof that the provider is Biden by the

1055
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:09,700
law and to be sure that data are

1056
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,349
destroyed when they should they have to

1057
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,270
guarantee that they're going to destroy

1058
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:16,240
my data when neither otherwise it's a

1059
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:19,990
risk prison example in a cloud company

1060
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,328
they they just remove the backups and

1061
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:24,308
they give them the drives to another

1062
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:27,549
person with confidential data in there

1063
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:29,470
in the hard drives or an person goes to

1064
00:59:27,549 --> 00:59:30,700
the photocopier in the company they they

1065
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:32,379
get the hard drive out of the

1066
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,000
photocopier and they

1067
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:38,380
go away with it do you know what it

1068
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:42,519
contains lots of data I have evidence of

1069
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:46,150
bank operations in banks here and they

1070
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:49,828
were contained in those photocopier hard

1071
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:53,170
drives they should have been destroyed

1072
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:55,420
if you see an old machine you get the

1073
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:57,579
manual from the machine or the

1074
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,289
photocopier their printer so you see all

1075
00:59:57,579 --> 01:00:04,170
the photocopies that have been made the

1076
00:59:59,289 --> 01:00:07,720
copiers normally they keep a little log

1077
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:10,390
a small snapshot of the photocopy that

1078
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:13,538
has been done you can find anything

1079
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:16,859
autopsy is a forensic software that

1080
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:20,950
allows you to study evidence and it's

1081
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:24,970
very well used you can work with the

1082
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:29,379
snapshots of virtual machines it's very

1083
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:31,240
simple not only is that the only option

1084
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:35,650
for that lit we'll see more details

1085
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:43,000
about this what's more another major

1086
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:45,579
risk is for the technicians or

1087
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,920
administrators administrators of people

1088
01:00:45,579 --> 01:00:50,490
that are directly handling the data I

1089
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:55,180
don't mean my people I mean the company

1090
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:57,970
that's stored my data I'm who my to know

1091
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:59,259
whether somebody's fed up their works

1092
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:01,000
for that company because they've reduced

1093
01:00:59,259 --> 01:01:04,359
their wages and they do something with

1094
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,009
my data or some other company's data

1095
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:15,759
this is one of the risks that you need

1096
01:01:06,009 --> 01:01:17,890
to consider what we clear on is that you

1097
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:21,750
need to consider all these risks you

1098
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:21,750
need to have them all in your head and

1099
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:30,279
whether we like it or not when we're in

1100
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:31,750
a cloud we're going to be exposed to a

1101
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:33,279
series of situations and circumstances

1102
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,240
that we're not going to be able to do

1103
01:01:33,279 --> 01:01:37,150
anything about people are going to be

1104
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,680
able to access from outside and they're

1105
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:41,190
going to try to access as well from

1106
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,190
inside

1107
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:50,220
what about strengthening cloud systems

1108
01:01:52,560 --> 01:02:00,490
first of all you need to have legal

1109
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:04,950
adherence especially if we encrypt we've

1110
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:08,799
got a password manager or the internal

1111
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:11,560
company management where we've got half

1112
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:15,190
of the password and the others of god´s

1113
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:18,940
the other half we always need to meet

1114
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:21,369
legal requirements we need to be sure

1115
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:23,820
that we're compliance whether that's

1116
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:30,609
with automatic tools or different

1117
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:32,859
technologies or so we need to be clear

1118
01:02:30,609 --> 01:02:35,650
that our data are kept under the best

1119
01:02:32,859 --> 01:02:39,310
conditions possible that there's a way

1120
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:41,200
of data destruction that good security

1121
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:45,369
policies have been defined that they

1122
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:50,799
used in separate environments for trials

1123
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:58,390
for production and we need to check all

1124
01:02:50,800 --> 01:03:03,160
the data environments we've tried as a

1125
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:05,890
team to get these kind of tools they're

1126
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:09,330
not too difficult to generate well we've

1127
01:03:05,890 --> 01:03:13,560
brought together a whole series of tools

1128
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:16,509
for cloud authority and different

1129
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:18,460
environments from a technical viewpoint

1130
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:21,660
and from a compliance viewpoint let's

1131
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:25,480
just have a look at how they work so

1132
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:27,069
that's the theory I know it's a pain to

1133
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:31,270
listen to this but it's necessary for

1134
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:33,460
you to understand the world that we're

1135
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:36,550
moving in let's now work on the

1136
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:38,970
practical side of things and the first

1137
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:42,369
practical side of things I want to

1138
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:46,990
propose to you is because I want you to

1139
01:03:42,369 --> 01:03:49,740
understand that normally a technician

1140
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:53,379
with certain amount of knowledge doesn't

1141
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:55,220
necessarily have to follow 100% of the

1142
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:58,880
rules all the time and

1143
01:03:55,220 --> 01:04:00,740
normally they can skip some of the

1144
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,410
limitations imposed by systems however

1145
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:06,439
famous saying maybe let's have a look at

1146
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:09,140
how that's done I'm going to give you an

1147
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:13,790
example with a tool that you've probably

1148
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:17,589
all heard of this tool excel you know

1149
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:17,590
excel this is an interesting tool

1150
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:27,740
because you can add data but I think

1151
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:31,520
somebody's actually invaded my excel

1152
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:34,069
sheet so I find this page I know this is

1153
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,349
a bit of a cliche but I want you to see

1154
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:42,320
how it works do you know that the

1155
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:46,090
majority of these files are actually

1156
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:46,090
like a zip container did you know that

1157
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:55,520
so let's have a look at this worksheet

1158
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:59,330
here I've got a sheet that maybe I want

1159
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:02,599
to edit what I'm going to try to do is

1160
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:09,020
to see what what happens here let's look

1161
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:13,130
at the end of it what I'm trying to find

1162
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:16,280
is the kind of password that we get

1163
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:18,500
using to try to violate this obviously

1164
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:23,960
on a spreadsheet you can try this at

1165
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:25,820
home and I can see it's got SH a 512 so

1166
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:31,960
anything that I want to try to touch

1167
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:34,280
here is going to be a bit difficult here

1168
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,330
there's some kind of protection so that

1169
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,330
are gonna take this

1170
01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:58,900
my colleague forgot to install this

1171
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:13,559
for demo purposes I'm not I'm just gonna

1172
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:18,569
I'm gonna remove it just in case but I'm

1173
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:21,059
gonna save it this as well this is what

1174
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:25,199
any normal person would do with an Excel

1175
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:26,909
spreadsheet that means that offer much

1176
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:30,479
protection I've got it doesn't matter

1177
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:32,699
matter I'm going to able to get round

1178
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:35,819
those protections because nobody has to

1179
01:06:32,699 --> 01:06:37,859
be honest what I've just done this with

1180
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:42,329
is are just a normal office program I

1181
01:06:37,859 --> 01:06:44,219
don't know if you know these kind of

1182
01:06:42,329 --> 01:06:47,609
techniques to avoid having to use the

1183
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:50,609
password but I've just done it so what

1184
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:55,709
you've just seen is one of the ways that

1185
01:06:50,609 --> 01:07:03,959
we can check to see how I can violate

1186
01:06:55,709 --> 01:07:06,328
data in a external virtual machine we

1187
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:08,399
were talking about mal practices earlier

1188
01:07:06,329 --> 01:07:11,219
we're talking about just one cable one

1189
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:16,380
cable or one channel to get to

1190
01:07:11,219 --> 01:07:20,119
everything what this means is it it

1191
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:24,839
throws up very basic problems

1192
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:28,319
meaning that somebody can just save this

1193
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:30,749
or just because we're bad we don't have

1194
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:36,599
any certificates we just have the data

1195
01:07:30,749 --> 01:07:38,999
flat data what does that mean we can get

1196
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:40,499
to where all the disks are stored and

1197
01:07:38,999 --> 01:07:42,959
we're not not going to need a brute

1198
01:07:40,499 --> 01:07:46,259
force to deal with the machine we're

1199
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:49,769
just gonna access the hard drives the

1200
01:07:46,259 --> 01:07:52,349
machines half drives let's just have a

1201
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:54,419
look at something before we do that I

1202
01:07:52,349 --> 01:07:56,699
said to you I was gonna save something I

1203
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:59,999
want to see where I've saved it because

1204
01:07:56,699 --> 01:08:06,229
I've got an access to a snapshot in this

1205
01:07:59,999 --> 01:08:10,189
case it's a virtual machine and it's a

1206
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:13,578
Linux align extinct you can just access

1207
01:08:10,189 --> 01:08:13,578
whatever you want

1208
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:20,799
it's a bit like a bit knave what's

1209
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:25,450
interesting is that many people use it

1210
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:27,970
and if we did any internet searches

1211
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:30,068
you'd probably find all kinds of these

1212
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:34,589
kinds of characteristics so making use

1213
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:37,750
of this let's just have a look now at

1214
01:08:34,589 --> 01:08:40,028
its origin what can I do with this well

1215
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:42,729
we're one of the most complicated tools

1216
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:46,270
to use that there are you remember that

1217
01:08:42,729 --> 01:08:47,740
I said that everything is done on

1218
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:48,970
snapshot that's what a snapshot looks

1219
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:52,660
like so it doesn't matter if it's in

1220
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:55,660
Linux Windows or whatever what do I do I

1221
01:08:52,660 --> 01:09:00,580
go and see if there's any sensitive

1222
01:08:55,660 --> 01:09:05,519
information here maybe there is you can

1223
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:10,479
do this at home on your own systems or

1224
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:11,799
outside systems and I'm going to see if

1225
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,669
I've got any access to anything

1226
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:14,670
interesting here

1227
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:25,299
and let's see what happens

1228
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:35,000
it's a big compressed file but doesn't

1229
01:09:32,988 --> 01:09:42,139
matter if it's got one Giga or 30 gigas

1230
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:44,000
in the file if you want to do any

1231
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:49,000
forensic investigation with this it

1232
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:56,600
could also be useful because I can see

1233
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:01,310
what's inside a on our car a file of a

1234
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:03,440
virtual machine or a snapshot that's the

1235
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:09,739
same with Linux with Windows it doesn't

1236
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:14,210
matter so what we're saying he's here

1237
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:16,730
that in a Linux machine we have

1238
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:20,330
different levels of permits within files

1239
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:24,110
and if we get to hard disks of these

1240
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:25,850
machines then we can avoid all those

1241
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:29,630
files we can change what if we want

1242
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:34,810
without any kind of permit at all this

1243
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:37,489
is the content of a disk unit in Windows

1244
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:41,870
imagine you all know how this works you

1245
01:10:37,489 --> 01:10:46,699
can see that number of users all the

1246
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:48,739
different contents that's what we're

1247
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:51,580
talking about when we say we're using

1248
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:53,570
shared infrastructures these kind of

1249
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,820
risks are out there

1250
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:57,920
I don't know if any of you had heard of

1251
01:10:55,820 --> 01:11:00,290
these systems when using these resources

1252
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,300
but this is one of the things that we

1253
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:04,250
consider you don't need any kind of

1254
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:09,100
exaggerated knowledge to access these

1255
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:09,100
things so let's just look

1256
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:18,820
because we were in a hurry we've brought

1257
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:21,540
with us the machine that we're

1258
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:29,889
developing in our app that we're forever

1259
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:34,300
modifying and also because we've got a

1260
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:39,330
lot of data in it so we didn't want to

1261
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:39,330
share all of the data let's start it

1262
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:50,150
and I'll leave it in your hands this

1263
01:11:46,070 --> 01:11:52,250
tool that we've developed and which is

1264
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:59,000
what it's going to allow us to do is to

1265
01:11:52,250 --> 01:12:05,150
group together a series of auditing

1266
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:07,790
tools simply it's going to be available

1267
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:09,379
in the github as like look like all

1268
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:15,350
presentations that we have been given

1269
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:17,739
here now the password isn't one two

1270
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,739
three four

1271
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:29,280
you can choose a tool from here who's

1272
01:12:26,469 --> 01:12:29,280
trying to connect

1273
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:50,000
it's a collection of tools not all of

1274
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:54,670
the ones that we use all the time but

1275
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:58,070
it's just for the demo today we also

1276
01:12:54,670 --> 01:13:01,180
wanted to show you the ones that are

1277
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:06,830
developed by Netflix I like chaos monkey

1278
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:14,060
because it makes my colleagues in

1279
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:24,050
production go mad what it does is it

1280
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:27,110
makes a different operations go somewhat

1281
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:29,510
imagine it it turns that the machines

1282
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:31,610
off just in a random fashion it's to

1283
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:35,270
create chaos it's quite obvious chaos

1284
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:37,490
monkey imagine it's a monkey going

1285
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:40,160
around turning things on but we're going

1286
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:45,200
to talk here about Prowler Prowler is a

1287
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:46,970
tool we're going to use it with Amazon

1288
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:49,940
in this case and what it's going to do

1289
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:51,590
is give us information about the

1290
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:56,860
compliance and basic security of our

1291
01:13:51,590 --> 01:14:01,840
accounts it's got the default passwords

1292
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:01,839
whether we've left any ports open etc

1293
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:29,020
well is that I'm internal this tool lets

1294
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:31,590
us check users users that have kept the

1295
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:37,510
same password for more than 90 days

1296
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:39,550
it'll give us some basic advice but some

1297
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:41,170
will depend upon the kind of

1298
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:44,110
infrastructure that we've deployed and

1299
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:49,510
what I like about this tool is that it's

1300
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:52,750
multi-tenant and we can set it up with

1301
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:55,060
different instances and different AWS

1302
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:59,440
accounts at the same time of course

1303
01:14:55,060 --> 01:15:03,490
we'll gradually see the warnings they

1304
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:07,690
remind us that we get and if there's a

1305
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:11,019
serious violation it won't tell us

1306
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:13,900
so we'll see default passwords ports

1307
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:17,340
that we're using and even malpractice

1308
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:23,530
and here in this specific case it's

1309
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:25,590
showing us several faults for example

1310
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:29,290
you haven't generated encrypted

1311
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:32,740
passwords some Metra's are giving you

1312
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:36,010
strange values this also allows us to

1313
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:38,950
give our own rules and codes but we need

1314
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:41,920
to be aware that we have these tools

1315
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:45,010
what's important is that we spend part

1316
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:50,290
of our time our infrastructure time to

1317
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:53,500
create and maintain a state of art where

1318
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:55,720
all these tools are reflected and

1319
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:57,820
documented and the updated

1320
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,110
checked and try to use them as much as

1321
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:02,799
possible and automate them how can they

1322
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:06,059
be automated well this is part of the

1323
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:09,520
audits that we have to carry out and

1324
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:12,820
both for the risks that we've looked at

1325
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:15,820
and all the things that's out there we

1326
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:21,820
realized via a friend the other day that

1327
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:23,769
their new VG PD are gonna force all

1328
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:25,090
public institutions to have two audits

1329
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:27,639
per year

1330
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:30,880
and that's gonna be very interesting

1331
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:35,179
because people are reluctant to do so

1332
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:38,270
they will say okay why me why me you're

1333
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:45,020
gonna make me do that yes it's as simple

1334
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:50,090
as that and I've seen it firsthand from

1335
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:51,920
a security viewpoint by the way this is

1336
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:55,820
a little bit obsolete now that you need

1337
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:59,030
to remember that it's just a blicket

1338
01:16:55,820 --> 01:17:00,320
tree and it's gonna be secure for

1339
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:03,050
everybody it's gonna be safer for

1340
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:08,630
everybody if people are forced to do an

1341
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:12,170
audit twice a year I was just having a

1342
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:18,020
look at it because despite the fact that

1343
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:20,659
this is a trial account for this demo

1344
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:26,090
you can see that with a default setup

1345
01:17:20,659 --> 01:17:27,349
all kinds of different problems that

1346
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:32,929
need to be taken into account of being

1347
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:35,750
thrown up so we have to look at it first

1348
01:17:32,929 --> 01:17:38,239
and we can see that these tools you can

1349
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:39,800
have fun lots of accessibility when I

1350
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:42,199
say lots of it you're going to find a

1351
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:44,540
bit more and more you need to see that

1352
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:48,949
the information that you get is reliable

1353
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:50,870
and updated otherwise as you can

1354
01:17:48,949 --> 01:17:55,669
probably imagine the cloud world is an

1355
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:58,429
ever-changing world and a tool from four

1356
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:59,510
years ago isn't useful because it's not

1357
01:17:58,429 --> 01:18:02,750
going to take into account many of the

1358
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:04,600
things that exist today and it's not

1359
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:07,219
just this what we need when we use cloud

1360
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:09,350
because this here a series of things

1361
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:14,480
that actually won't happen you'd also

1362
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:20,409
need the possibility of carrying out pen

1363
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:20,409
tests and try to monitor them

1364
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:25,589
and many of the providers that you're

1365
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:27,989
gonna have will refuse to do this they

1366
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:37,050
won't want to do this we're just saying

1367
01:18:27,989 --> 01:18:42,209
that these kind of tools there's one out

1368
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:44,429
there called kit Floyd's which talks

1369
01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:48,780
about many tools there's that it's got

1370
01:18:44,429 --> 01:18:52,290
this own tool which standardized as many

1371
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:55,380
pest pet test tools we've got a small

1372
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:58,530
spin-off as well and each cloud platform

1373
01:18:55,380 --> 01:19:01,830
is its own little world if we have them

1374
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:07,019
where or as here it's mostly all the

1375
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:10,280
same but if we turned more to a type of

1376
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:12,570
open nebula infrastructure OpenStack

1377
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:15,540
things are a lot different especially in

1378
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:19,139
OpenStack where you have one machine for

1379
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:22,409
each essential service of our cloud one

1380
01:19:19,139 --> 01:19:25,619
which is for users another which moves

1381
01:19:22,409 --> 01:19:28,138
some messaging service between the

1382
01:19:25,619 --> 01:19:31,559
different machines another which is just

1383
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:34,920
for the net which is neutrino and nother

1384
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:37,290
which is just for storage to bring

1385
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:39,980
together all the different components or

1386
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:42,690
infrastructure discs that we have and

1387
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:45,299
make that this literally works now can

1388
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:48,150
you audit all of that you have to start

1389
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:53,460
with the basics you're always going to

1390
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:57,449
need to have some kind of a matrix we're

1391
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:58,889
actually from a legal viewpoint you're

1392
01:19:57,449 --> 01:20:01,409
gonna have to meet all the necessary

1393
01:19:58,889 --> 01:20:03,530
requirements in addition to that you're

1394
01:20:01,409 --> 01:20:07,670
gonna need on that matrix to gradually

1395
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:13,500
incorporate more and more technical

1396
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:17,429
advice why because it changes very

1397
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:19,409
rapidly as Antonio says in open nebula

1398
01:20:17,429 --> 01:20:24,409
which is used a lot I don't if you've no

1399
01:20:19,409 --> 01:20:24,409
open nebula it's a cloud system

1400
01:20:24,449 --> 01:20:30,830
set up by several providers all the

1401
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:37,230
major manufacturers have joined it and

1402
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:40,860
in fact governments have taken part in

1403
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:43,830
it and overnight I think it was on

1404
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:46,349
version 8 they changed all the

1405
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:49,790
management part everybody that was

1406
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:56,000
certified and used to using this system

1407
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:59,310
this change has just destroyed them

1408
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,770
you've found all these different badly

1409
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:05,989
set up panels something that's very

1410
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:05,989
important just in a simple search

1411
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,370
because of this this always takes us to

1412
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:18,000
the same conclusion which is that

1413
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:19,760
training is very important now this

1414
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:24,890
issue of ports and we're seeing that now

1415
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:28,650
you can see what your open an

1416
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:30,480
interesting point of this auditing

1417
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:32,730
system it's not that it's just what I'm

1418
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:35,129
seeing but that it produces a report

1419
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:37,530
that can be used because there's some of

1420
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:39,030
these kind of audits in which the

1421
01:21:37,530 --> 01:21:44,820
reports that it produces aren't very

1422
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:47,370
good within these pen tests let's look

1423
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:50,070
at the most basic pen test the most

1424
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:52,969
basic of course is always going to be

1425
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:52,969
nmap

1426
01:21:55,460 --> 01:22:02,100
then depending upon the type of

1427
01:21:58,370 --> 01:22:08,580
infrastructure they'll some that try to

1428
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:14,760
look at the faults that I have what

1429
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:20,330
about open source pen tests there's what

1430
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:22,200
start you can use Nexus Open bus

1431
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:25,350
depending on the kind of pentas you want

1432
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:29,000
to carry out and if I want to carry out

1433
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:31,740
an audit before contracting somebody

1434
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,290
just for the basics what is the most

1435
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:36,050
important part of these audits what's

1436
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:40,980
the most important part of these tools

1437
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:43,950
but you have to tool around because any

1438
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:49,910
tool that you have the worst thing that

1439
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:52,860
could happen is that you use too much

1440
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:54,990
too many resources that you destroy the

1441
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:57,330
information that's simply so the first

1442
01:22:54,990 --> 01:23:01,110
thing is to guarantee that our tool

1443
01:22:57,330 --> 01:23:02,880
isn't intrusive if I want something

1444
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:04,530
that's intrusive that I need to be clear

1445
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:12,870
on that but it's not something that

1446
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:14,940
anybody can do this is never end I think

1447
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:18,210
it's got more information here that then

1448
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:24,719
you need you've left the port open it's

1449
01:23:18,210 --> 01:23:29,280
a broad audit a thorough one maybe we've

1450
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:33,360
loaded too many machines but whilst this

1451
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:36,030
carries on if the colleague that helped

1452
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,799
us design this thinks that we've done

1453
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:40,190
something bad can you please send us a

1454
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,190
what's up

1455
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:50,440
and in these kinds of audits it's

1456
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:53,300
important the technology that we use the

1457
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:54,980
providers what tools we have what budget

1458
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:58,190
and also training training training

1459
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:59,690
these kinds of events a cyber camp event

1460
01:23:58,190 --> 01:24:04,450
where you've got these kinds of

1461
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:04,450
workshops where we can see how complex

1462
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:10,370
it is to cover everybody's expectations

1463
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:13,040
to meet everybody's expectations are

1464
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:15,040
still very important because they

1465
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:20,269
provide us a lot of information useful

1466
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:22,940
information that's true so coming back

1467
01:24:20,270 --> 01:24:25,430
to the issue of risks this is something

1468
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:28,460
that I've left to one side awareness

1469
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:31,240
training and compliance is really

1470
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:33,620
important for all these sort of things I

1471
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:37,750
think we should stop it now because it's

1472
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:40,460
just duplicating we've done something

1473
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:42,560
wrong what either we put too many counts

1474
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:45,740
in there or we've asked it to look at

1475
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:47,950
too many machines let's talk about the

1476
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:47,950
others

1477
01:24:49,349 --> 01:25:00,420
let's have a look at another machine

1478
01:24:53,219 --> 01:25:02,639
that's a bit more prepared this is

1479
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:05,639
another one that we're trying at

1480
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:08,940
lunchtime what we've included a series

1481
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:11,369
of additional tools within the muniya

1482
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:14,940
menu and we're gonna upload this to

1483
01:25:11,369 --> 01:25:15,900
github and we'll explain how more tools

1484
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:24,449
can be added

1485
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:27,030
it's made-to-measure we're going have

1486
01:25:24,449 --> 01:25:31,339
one version for free that everybody will

1487
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:37,650
use and that'll simplify our useless

1488
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:40,440
moving back to pen test tools sometimes

1489
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:48,509
give you very complex they can be very

1490
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:49,980
complex reports oh what's up is the one

1491
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:53,429
of the most recommended one if you're

1492
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:57,570
using it as updates it's quite frequent

1493
01:25:53,429 --> 01:25:59,730
the updates and it can be a good

1494
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:02,340
starting point but we need to consider

1495
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:06,449
that one of the most complicated things

1496
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:09,780
that you find are false positives we

1497
01:26:06,449 --> 01:26:11,519
like these kinds of tools and the one

1498
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:13,559
that we use internally is a little bit

1499
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:20,190
more advanced it's got some additional

1500
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:24,090
options because we work from the attack

1501
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:26,150
tree perspective we try to see what sort

1502
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:30,920
of infrastructure the customer has and

1503
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:36,150
with that define the attack plan and

1504
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:39,179
just use a logical port mark the order

1505
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:42,138
in what we're going to audit and see

1506
01:26:39,179 --> 01:26:42,139
what information we get

1507
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,250
in this case it's always gonna ask for

1508
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:52,350
the same thing and we can choose the

1509
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:52,350
ones that we want to run and then wait

1510
01:26:53,880 --> 01:27:00,850
it is very important to define the scope

1511
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:02,080
no it seems we can't connect that's what

1512
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:06,610
happens when you're doing things live

1513
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:10,420
it's very important to define the scope

1514
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:15,570
of an audit because recently the other

1515
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:15,570
day I was designing a sort of an a home

1516
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:22,210
home system using over get to make

1517
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,770
backup systems I was looking at over

1518
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:29,890
gates and seeing what I had and I didn't

1519
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:33,490
realize that machine that I was sending

1520
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:35,550
the resources from had more than the one

1521
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:41,590
that was receiving it this is quite

1522
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:43,720
common with open test trials we may see

1523
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:51,880
that we've got more resources than the

1524
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:57,940
customer and we may create problems so

1525
01:27:51,880 --> 01:28:02,140
scope is very important when you do this

1526
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:03,759
on pre-production environments rather

1527
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:05,200
than production environments these are

1528
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,850
perhaps their cover the best piece of a

1529
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,849
pieces of advice that we can give you

1530
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:20,000
this is another thing that you need to

1531
01:28:18,490 --> 01:28:21,769
consider

1532
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,130
of course it depends on the type of

1533
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:26,630
clouds that you've got but you can't put

1534
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:28,640
it in anybody's hands

1535
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,840
that's a terrible problem we talk about

1536
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:32,150
data but not just when you talk about

1537
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:34,640
data remember that one of the things

1538
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:37,160
that we could provoke is excess

1539
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:40,220
information it's not just much data

1540
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:46,150
traffic but I might actually start

1541
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:46,150
creating dirty data and ruin somebody

1542
01:28:47,440 --> 01:29:01,690
especially when automating a connection

1543
01:28:55,010 --> 01:29:01,690
test in a database you it's really

1544
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:11,839
unforeseen you talk about typical pen

1545
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:14,840
test tools just be careful cuz otherwise

1546
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:19,940
you might ruin something not just the

1547
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:21,230
expense account but it may well be we

1548
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:24,230
don't want to corrupt information that's

1549
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:25,820
also very important if you've got any

1550
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:27,620
questions while we're trying to get this

1551
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:29,809
to work please do ask them something

1552
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:35,809
we're doing wrong because we can't get

1553
01:29:29,810 --> 01:29:38,060
the final report if you've got any

1554
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:42,170
further questions while we're trying to

1555
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:44,170
make this run please interrupt for some

1556
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:46,310
reason it's not giving us a final report

1557
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:49,310
okay at the end when it finishes you

1558
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:52,340
will create a report and where we'll be

1559
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:53,750
able to see all the reminders and

1560
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:57,590
warnings any problems that we may have

1561
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:59,450
had if it doesn't finish today it

1562
01:29:57,590 --> 01:30:04,460
doesn't matter we'll still let you use

1563
01:29:59,450 --> 01:30:07,880
the tool with a free account any

1564
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:11,450
questions before we get to the next part

1565
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:18,020
if you have no questions we'll try to

1566
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:20,660
finish I've still 20 minutes to go the

1567
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:26,830
way to talk about infrastructures then

1568
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:26,830
will be over no questions

1569
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:46,230
my name is Pedro national providers

1570
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:49,230
within the big ones and if you have to

1571
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:51,379
abide by the data protection rules or

1572
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:55,230
security national security legislation

1573
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:58,400
do you know some any in Spanish

1574
01:30:55,230 --> 01:31:02,580
suppliers giving guarantees we cannot

1575
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:05,759
mention any of those I cannot make an

1576
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:11,700
advert advertising there are cloud and

1577
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:14,730
local cloud suppliers in Spain they have

1578
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:19,920
they specify where the data center is

1579
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:22,950
why that I won't mention here has a data

1580
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:25,170
center in China and in Spain and you can

1581
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:34,290
choose if you want to hire those

1582
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:38,610
services in China or in Spain after the

1583
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:40,590
talk we can mention three or four

1584
01:31:38,610 --> 01:31:42,450
supplies I don't want to be in conflict

1585
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:44,940
because some of it the providers are

1586
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:49,730
friends others are not friends of mine

1587
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:49,730
so I can help you later with the names

1588
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:58,190
in theory any provider having their

1589
01:31:56,370 --> 01:32:01,110
installations here in Spain have to

1590
01:31:58,190 --> 01:32:04,940
abide by the Spanish legislation not

1591
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:09,410
just a legislation you need to know that

1592
01:32:04,940 --> 01:32:12,419
we have always to audit providers

1593
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:15,510
you can't ask simple questions are you

1594
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:18,300
going to separate the data route do you

1595
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:20,130
have 24 hours personnel is it yours is

1596
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:23,550
it third parties who can access service

1597
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:25,440
if other customers can get in do I share

1598
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:30,360
my infrastructures with many customers

1599
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:32,969
if this burns down what happens there

1600
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:36,269
was a nice video authoring questions

1601
01:32:32,970 --> 01:32:39,510
nobody can answer the procedural guy

1602
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:41,520
there on the fourth row can cover that

1603
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:43,710
because they offer simple products if

1604
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,900
there is a bomb falling on the

1605
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:48,960
Center if there's a ruin with a big

1606
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:53,339
crater what happens if the bomb Falls

1607
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:55,440
here how do you solve this problem well

1608
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:59,040
the great vast majority of data center

1609
01:32:55,440 --> 01:33:04,259
have a special service called human

1610
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:06,540
Court there are security guards they're

1611
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:09,150
not even going to look the crater but

1612
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:11,820
they're going to to place themselves

1613
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:13,739
around the crater so nobody can see and

1614
01:33:11,820 --> 01:33:16,830
get there this is good for business

1615
01:33:13,739 --> 01:33:19,049
continuity if you this data have been

1616
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:20,040
destroyed forever secondly how much do I

1617
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:23,820
have to pay for that

1618
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:25,650
do you have replicated the data some you

1619
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:27,809
know some other place in Madrid you can

1620
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:29,969
have the data center here but you can

1621
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:34,170
have connect to other servers with fiber

1622
01:33:29,969 --> 01:33:37,620
if it's a data center crushes you need

1623
01:33:34,170 --> 01:33:40,980
to have another Center all data centers

1624
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:44,820
in Madrid have suffered zero the

1625
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:48,450
absolute zero this happens all over the

1626
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:50,190
place but this if this happened with the

1627
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:53,340
cloud virtualization technology all the

1628
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:55,200
infrastructures will restart another

1629
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:58,620
data centers we're not going to lose

1630
01:33:55,200 --> 01:34:00,360
work we're going to stop for a long time

1631
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:03,570
but it's important to know if that

1632
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:05,940
backup server is still in the house in

1633
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:08,340
the same city in Spain or in China those

1634
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:10,860
audits are very important when your

1635
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:13,650
project is big and important or when

1636
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:16,170
there's it's very relevant the provider

1637
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:19,080
is going to answer that question you're

1638
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:21,719
going to have a a meeting you will see

1639
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:25,469
the data center you will have

1640
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:30,360
explanations about the the generators

1641
01:34:25,469 --> 01:34:31,739
the gas the fuel is and another building

1642
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:34,049
they're going to give you all the

1643
01:34:31,739 --> 01:34:39,570
technical details of how a data server

1644
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:41,190
works if it's a good provider and they

1645
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:44,250
should give you the explanations and

1646
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:47,190
they would they normally have standards

1647
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:48,989
and certifications ISO ISO standard

1648
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:51,839
safer I would hire or service of this

1649
01:34:48,989 --> 01:34:56,070
type in Spain first of all I'd like to

1650
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:57,590
go to see the providers data center he

1651
01:34:56,070 --> 01:35:00,719
can show it to you

1652
01:34:57,590 --> 01:35:02,850
there are areas in CPD's that we can

1653
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:09,420
consider as critical you can't get in of

1654
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:17,070
course you will have answers about the

1655
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:21,000
features you will know where bank data

1656
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:23,059
are managed but you can't get in but you

1657
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:27,750
have to be sure that they have

1658
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:30,420
certifications my advice is that well

1659
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:32,190
when I make orders I want to see the

1660
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:35,040
things I want to see the in the

1661
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:37,440
facilities don't tell me what are your

1662
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:39,060
certifications I want evidence of that

1663
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,759
because I'm the person responsible for

1664
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:45,120
everything happening later and even if I

1665
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:47,430
can't offer you that you can change and

1666
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:56,070
you don't maybe it's not necessary for

1667
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:57,840
you but you can choose any questions so

1668
01:35:56,070 --> 01:36:01,440
we couldn't see the report it would be

1669
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:04,830
quite interesting to see it and we are

1670
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:07,139
late for lunch I think we can stop it

1671
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:09,440
now we could stop now if we want to any

1672
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:17,140
questions great thank you

1673
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:17,139
