that you've worked hard my entry is

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:33,450
going to be very very brief because you

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,890
want to give you the floor directly for

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:42,360
the presentations just some housekeeping

8
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:45,420
you know what teams there are we've made

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,309
it to Sunday we're going to be here from

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,470
10:00 to 12:00

11
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,110
from 10:00 to 12:00 it'd be in this room

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:56,129
then we will move over to the second

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:00,030
area so that you do the voting we will

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:03,210
also submit you an assessment form and

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,750
around 1:00 we will have the scores the

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,229
two will the closing ceremony will take

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:13,259
place at 2:00 that's when the awards

18
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,320
will be giving I like to congratulate

19
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:17,130
you all for your hard work for your

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,949
companionship

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:24,568
for your teamwork you have ten minutes

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,970
per team we have a timer so that you

23
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:31,440
don't lose track of time

24
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:35,670
if there are any questions from the jury

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:39,030
well we will raise your hand and take

26
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:44,069
the floor remember you have repository

27
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:47,670
needs to be ready I like to insist once

28
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:52,429
again and that it's very important that

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,890
you convey clear messages that you also

30
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:58,229
tell us about changes if there have been

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,420
changes as opposed to your initial

32
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,459
approach make sure you highlight that

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,289
during your presentation it's very

34
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,270
important that the remaining teams are

35
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:08,220
aware of those changes we as members of

36
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,240
the URI already now

37
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,520
when we finish we will move over to the

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,190
hackathon area we'll provide you with a

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:21,890
questionnaire let's talk about voting

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:26,550
system each team will vote to the best

41
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:29,160
three armed teams so three points will

42
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,500
be giving to the team you liked most two

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,130
teams - the one you liked second most

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,290
and then one point to the team that you

45
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:42,540
believe should rank a third and then at

46
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:45,870
12:30 you will have already voted

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:48,660
so from 10:00 to noon we'll be here from

48
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,350
noon to quarter past twelve you will be

49
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,140
voting and then you will have some free

50
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,640
time and the award ceremony will take

51
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,980
place at 2:00

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,170
as for the order of presentations this

53
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,910
is very important you need to bear this

54
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:05,489
in mind because you need to be ready

55
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,799
certainty will take the 4 first and we

56
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:14,480
have Alejandra with passaic Reeve and

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:18,360
then monster hack remember the scores of

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,350
milestone - yeah as you can see it's

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,870
very tight it's very tight now it's a

60
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,880
crucial time this is the asset test

61
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,650
don't get nervous because we're here to

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,840
learn from each other we are also

63
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,650
learning from you I hope you've learned

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,690
from us

65
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,010
members of the year as well and let the

66
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,850
force be with you

67
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,579
best of luck

hola whenever you settlers

74
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:47,930
good morning everybody as you know my

75
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,530
name is Santiago I'm a member of masks

76
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:54,349
team the team that has been working on a

77
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,929
malware web scanner first of all I'd

78
00:05:54,349 --> 00:06:00,889
like to share with you the contents of

79
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:04,460
my presentation the first part is

80
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:08,599
basically a copy of what I explained to

81
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:15,440
unday one regarding my objectives second

82
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:19,159
I'll explain my proposals of the members

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,770
of the jury thirdly I'll explain to you

84
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:24,770
what I've done in the end based on what

85
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:27,229
I said and what you said then I'll show

86
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,198
you a demo have brought a screenshot and

87
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:34,430
I also do a demo with my computer and

88
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:37,940
then I'll talk about some ideas for the

89
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:40,639
futures about things I'd like to try out

90
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,740
in the future based and my own ideas and

91
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,740
ideas from members of the audience

92
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:54,490
initially mask was going to be a malware

93
00:06:48,710 --> 00:07:00,380
scanner that could search and/or clean

94
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:03,340
and if it could only search the idea

95
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:07,629
would be to be able to detect files with

96
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:11,539
infected code in order to to take the

97
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:14,930
file and report that to the user so that

98
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:19,729
he or she could manually eliminated and

99
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:22,909
the idea was that ideally the software

100
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:26,378
would automatically eliminate those

101
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:28,270
files and clean them and also identify

102
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:35,139
potential

103
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:41,020
I wanted to give it with the behavior of

104
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:43,960
some well-known software and that exists

105
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,448
in this view it's true that some

106
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,440
scanners are not able to detect a

107
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:54,729
viruses I wanted to work based on

108
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:58,300
different scenarios signatures etc and I

109
00:07:54,729 --> 00:08:02,139
wanted my solution to be scalable

110
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:05,199
meaning that if someone was willing to

111
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:07,560
add a functionality he could program an

112
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,710
additional part and add it to my

113
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,310
software I wanted to be able to be

114
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:18,400
compatible with different content

115
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:22,240
administrators and I'll explain a bit

116
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,330
later what I've managed to do I wanted

117
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,120
to have a scalable architecture I also

118
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:31,300
talked about the need of protecting on

119
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,209
this side asking for the relations also

120
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,479
offer the user the possibility of

121
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:41,439
restoring the website ie restoring once

122
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:45,520
clean and the website and leave it as it

123
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,579
was originally because maybe cleaning

124
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,390
isn't appropriate or is excessive and I

125
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:55,239
wanted to use this signature so the

126
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,459
worst a malware program that I found

127
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,279
before coming here then that I thought

128
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:04,170
it would be interesting also for my tool

129
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,189
on day one the members of the jury

130
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,099
suggested that I would register

131
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:12,010
everything in the log give the user the

132
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,370
possibility of cleaning and adding

133
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:19,810
protection layer

134
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:22,030
because the it's true that it's

135
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,430
interesting to know what version we're

136
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,030
talking about and adding and short

137
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,859
another protection Larry then the

138
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:34,300
reservation option I've already covered

139
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:37,120
is and whenever there's cleaning done to

140
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,520
do an automatic backup because perhaps

141
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,190
the backup or the clean or rather the

142
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,810
cleaning is too aggressive and damage is

143
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:49,900
the website we can give the user to do

144
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:52,839
backup I can do a backup and then

145
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,569
manually work on the tools and do things

146
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,810
that the tool alone cannot do then

147
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:02,400
restore this side and they also

148
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:05,319
suggested that the have could be

149
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:10,720
uploaded to PI P to a dog image and

150
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:14,080
that's something that I did this malware

151
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,920
scanner searchers cleans automatically

152
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:22,420
some Moberg I've focused on WordPress

153
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:25,900
and I've also added support for some

154
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,760
content administrators I've used clean

155
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:32,550
isolations and I've compared them with

156
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:35,770
previous versions I work with o

157
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,819
westbound malware signature and this is

158
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:42,010
easily extendable because I've organized

159
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,230
it in such a way that it's easy to add

160
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,439
support for different the content

161
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,890
administrators it also cleans the

162
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,230
malware and just back of the user can do

163
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,890
this everything is duly registered and

164
00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:00,370
long some I've done some cleaning of the

165
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:02,500
website as I do the cleaning of the file

166
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,900
and I've included the option of

167
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,150
monitoring the website so that if there

168
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,720
are any changes and the website that is

169
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:15,329
duly registered and along and now I like

170
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,330
to I'll show you a demo of this tool

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:32,850
there you can see the command line i've

172
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:39,420
prepared i've prepared a series of site

173
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:42,050
websites here they are this is a custom

174
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,449
site that doesn't belong to any known

175
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,779
well-known content administrator have

176
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:51,839
also have our group side in a wordpress

177
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:54,540
and I've reduced this size because it

178
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,550
was originally very big and since it has

179
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,740
several magus it would take too much

180
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:02,010
time and I've introduced deliberately

181
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,520
some malware files that I detected with

182
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:09,720
a wisp and now let's test around the

183
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:12,600
scanner to see how it works first thing

184
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:17,060
that I'm going to do for the sake of

185
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,360
time I student run a full cleaning up

186
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,359
WordPress file

187
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,220
I've used the command to clean the

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,240
website on now I'll scan it and I'll

189
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:00,180
also do a backup as you will see first

190
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:07,070
thing it does is to upload the signature

191
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:07,069
scenario we do this with the OS project

192
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,079
/ - Navidad octave Allah

193
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,800
Molly

194
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:38,260
in percentage well you see another thing

195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:42,130
we turn it out I see so we're going to

196
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:45,100
be generous he was the first to take the

197
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:48,820
floor but please make sure that you have

198
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:53,490
everything 100% ready okay we're going

199
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,490
to give you two extra minutes okay

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,910
thanks for that as for connections of

201
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:04,969
course the scanner downloads

202
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,969
[Music]

203
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:15,840
administrator and the version searches

204
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:19,330
for malware and detects potentially

205
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:23,280
malicious files that are not going side

206
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,280
with a theme version so there's

207
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:31,990
suspicious files they are compared and

208
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:35,319
cleaned and we also anonymize the site

209
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:39,970
log file is generated that I'll show you

210
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:43,270
now reflects all the info of eliminated

211
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:45,940
files and the backup will be generated

212
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:49,949
as well as well as additional info on

213
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,950
the cleaning process

214
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,970
[Music]

215
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:02,590
well there you can see on the back up of

216
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,590
the website I've selected

217
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:29,489
if there's a real feature locking this

218
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:35,540
is the log file so to say there we have

219
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:35,540
the suspicious or malware infected files

220
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,610
I'd also like to show you the monitoring

221
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,060
option that I implemented yesterday so

222
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,940
that you can see how we can scan and

223
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:03,819
monitor a website so that all changes in

224
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,820
the website armed and silly reported

225
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:21,900
so there we have the monitoring process

226
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:25,470
the details her data of the monitoring

227
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:30,800
process are registered in the log and

228
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,800
appear on screen I'll show you this now

229
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:48,710
a for example file is created this is

230
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,020
reported not a fun and it's registered

231
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,830
in the log with the date and hours so

232
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,080
that I know when that has happened I

233
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:03,139
will know whether it's smaller whether

234
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:05,120
it's romantic my times out well that's

235
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,730
the end of my presentation I'm afraid

236
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,459
I'm sorry about those connectivity

237
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:23,870
issues and you have any questions face

238
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:26,750
with me no questions no in the sea in

239
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:29,120
the Kibo this hobby skill I said if you

240
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,210
know you're the team that will take them

241
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,520
for after the next speaker please get

242
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:39,710
ready sandy has burgundy eyes

243
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:43,730
congratulations Santi and it's true that

244
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:47,000
so is hard to be the first and to face

245
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,630
unforeseen events those that take the

246
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,360
four afterwards learn from these

247
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,910
mistakes so please make sure you're

248
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,020
ready you've got everything perfectly

prepared and Santi is on his loan if

250
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,740
you're several members of the team

251

please make sure that the tasks of rules

252
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,510
are delivers distributed everything

253
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,220
ready please and now it's gone

254
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:13,450
let's move on to the next presentation

255
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,450
by alejandro

256
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,129
malee Tenace but i referencia but i get

257
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:25,129
for your reference for the sake of

258
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:29,899
clarity we have a timer you have ten

259
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:32,570
minutes and we will draw your attention

260
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:41,590
when you have five minutes remaining

261
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:45,439
I see so you know good morning everybody

262
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:51,590
my name is Alejandro and I'm here to

263
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:55,759
present my project I'm going to show you

264
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:58,879
a demo directly and at the end of the

265
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,639
demo I'll show you a file with a speed

266
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:10,189
test because that was the number one for

267
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:18,258
my head with this software we boot the

268
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:21,169
system with no parameter as you can see

269
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:23,370
there you have the wizard the support

270
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:27,120
window

271
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,280
the document align is that which is most

272
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,669
important the different options you've

273
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,879
got to make a request to the sufferer

274
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:38,460
with this program and this demo we're

275
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:46,130
going to generate a hash of an existing

276
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:46,130
file that is cold 64k so you can see it

277
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:55,610
and you'll understand now the speed it

278
00:20:52,010 --> 00:21:02,480
can reach we introduced the document

279
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:06,800
line we introduce a parameter for it to

280
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:15,490
store the file inside the hash of this

281
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:15,490
demo and then we execute it we run it

282
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:30,909
this takes around 10 seconds yesterday I

283
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,000
discovered that the Windows version is a

284
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:37,559
bit faster than the Linux version which

285
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,559
was somehow surprised

286
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:50,060
this is the hash that is generator that

287
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,060
is stored in a file

288
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:13,789
okay I'll interrupt this here because

289
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:16,250
this half flow data can take home some

290
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:19,269
time and the hash has been stored in

291
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,269
this file

292
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:46,590
once old texts line 64,000 characters to

293
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:53,880
check and verify the hash what we do is

294
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:58,159
view the command line and then we select

295
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,160
the compare function

296
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:23,460
if you have time

297
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:45,340
you can treat your adapter to a coffee

298
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:49,390
that was the joke as you can see the

299
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:53,709
hash has stored the data that they meet

300
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:57,490
our the name of it tells us that we have

301
00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:02,130
a file stored and the check zone of the

302
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:02,130
file this means that the original file

303
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:15,780
can now be changed a flame directly from

304
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:23,669
the hash because it's installed inside

305
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:23,670
we can therefore extract the stored hash

306
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:18,310
I'll get in the middle of the stables

307
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:21,010
here we have the two files this is the

308
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:23,730
one generated from the hash the one

309
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:27,629
that's stored so he have the comparison

310
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,630
between the two files

311
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:48,139
the comparative corrector you want to

312
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:52,790
say there you can see everything's

313
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:54,230
correct and now to complete this I have

314
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:58,639
to say that I didn't have time to

315
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:02,840
prepare a presentation but here you have

316
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:08,650
a comparison oh the speed tests that

317
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:14,629
I've carried out over the night these

318
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:17,750
tests will be improved when I'm able to

319
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:20,690
develop a more efficient compiler

320
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:23,900
because when the character chains are

321
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:27,260
very long I'm afraid this software is

322
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:31,270
not as efficient that's it on my site

323
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,270
thanks very much and good luck everybody

324
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:39,129
Alejandro just a question

325
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:42,140
this allows you to have hashes from

326
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:44,690
messages from a text chain as from a

327
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:48,830
file yes I didn't say it in the demo but

328
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:51,640
it does allow a messages a chain of

329
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,830
messages on a file have you

330
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:59,930
differentiate the settings to specify no

331
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:03,050
it is in automatic mode what happened a

332
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:07,310
few days ago is that the program takes

333
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:11,210
the file name by default even and this

334
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:14,840
is not a failure but a feature is the

335
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:18,080
files name by default to open up the

336
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,490
file any other question thank you so

337
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,279
much for your attention

339
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,600
this is here

[Music]

341
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:24,880
we have created a library that was

342
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:30,720
planned to implement different functions

343
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:37,150
based on the Shasha algorithm we've also

344
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:40,780
thought about implementing a is it was

345
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:48,910
quite complex so it was just a project

346
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:55,230
here you have the files is files were

347
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:58,450
the majority of the functions work

348
00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:03,690
correctly but the problem is to

349
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:08,460
communicate them the idea was an

350
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:12,340
implementation that could allow

351
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:16,480
pseudo-random number creation starting

352
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:20,409
with a seed that requires some security

353
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:25,450
so that any other random number

354
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:32,230
generators they also require a seed with

355
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:37,030
a minimum level of entropy but the

356
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:42,470
advantage of our implementation compared

357
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:44,490
to thus devdas random or use a

358
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:48,360
[Music]

359
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:51,970
transmitter in an electronic system

360
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:55,780
receiving electromagnetic fluctuations

361
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:59,650
from the atmosphere the advantage of our

362
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:03,870
system is that is faster Anita provides

363
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:06,370
the same degree of security the

364
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:13,199
objective and this has already been

365
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:13,199
implemented a new Krypton algorithm ah

366
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:24,340
this is the numbers generator as I

367
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:29,190
showed in the first presentation we just

368
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:29,189
need to set acid through this argument

369
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:45,910
in the context this is a ram context and

370
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:49,810
it's a structure that contains the

371
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:55,450
possibility to introduce acid 32 bytes

372
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:58,450
and announce over 12 bytes so we can get

373
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:02,350
a siddha 44 bytes which is very

374
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:09,690
different from the 32 bytes seeds used

375
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:09,689
by random and LS random the encryption

376
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,990
encryption algorithm here we have the

377
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:22,530
the encryption algorithm and here the

378
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:26,740
encryption one we just introduced the

379
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:30,370
passwords the none the length of the

380
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:32,970
message and a pointer sign alene where

381
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:36,310
the encrypted message is going to be

382
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:40,950
introduced this encrypted message will

383
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:40,950
have the same length as the message in

384
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:57,490
blank text but we have also implemented

385
00:31:46,420 --> 00:32:01,840
a parser API this is a client-server

386
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:04,450
scheme that allows the customer to

387
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:09,220
connect to the server and through a

388
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:13,780
secure connection to execute different

389
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:17,470
commands this is the demo where we

390
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:25,059
implemented what did you requested

391
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:29,890
to compile the server in order to

392
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:33,428
compile the server we can select the

393
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:39,340
compiled all dot C files of the project

394
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:43,179
and through a macro with the argument -

395
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:48,100
D to define the macro we create a macro

396
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:52,840
server and it generates the server we

397
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:58,139
compile them and we get the server is an

398
00:32:52,840 --> 00:33:04,320
execute that is not too heavy 23

399
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:08,890
kilobytes is not too heavy and it allows

400
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:12,549
information about the port and the

401
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:15,669
client is the same the compiling process

402
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:21,460
the same as with the server but the

403
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:24,610
macro to be defined his macro client

404
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,330
will compile them and when you execute

405
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,689
it

406
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:34,990
he should indicate the host it allows

407
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:42,840
DNS and the port through the argument

408
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:47,110
you can indicate a file to host the case

409
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:48,699
as it was requested by the URI we can do

410
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:53,379
it with a server but we don't have time

411
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:58,200
to show how it works and here we have a

412
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,200
demo and we see

413
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:12,820
that they are connected we can see in

414
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:18,690
detail this is the freeway of handshake

415
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:22,660
based on DCP handshake in the

416
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:27,190
communication protocol of our library we

417
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:29,469
include two headers I'm going to open

418
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:36,070
this in a new window so that everything

419
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:47,770
is clear to Heather but which is the

420
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:53,550
header XD and then he sent two nouns in

421
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:57,340
order to avoid tolki effect if both ends

422
00:34:53,550 --> 00:35:00,490
communicate simultaneously the

423
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:06,880
communication is interrupted we use

424
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:10,390
different keys so that each of the ends

425
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,760
use different keys does flow of

426
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:16,089
different case generated so that they

427
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,100
don't share them and if two messages are

428
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:21,130
sent as simultaneous lis they can

429
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:25,589
process it without using the same key or

430
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:31,410
password for the message the server

431
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:31,410
parcel that is implemented here

432
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,990
that is parser parser function is very

433
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:41,110
simple you just have to compare the

434
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:45,669
received text m in this case with a

435
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:49,300
chain and you execute the necessary

436
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:58,120
commands as they are indicated here this

437
00:35:49,300 --> 00:36:01,060
function send msg or receive je sent and

438
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:04,080
received message we allowed the

439
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:07,960
communication through the created tunnel

440
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:15,310
when will receive SD command its sensory

441
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:19,690
tunnel or if we get WS is RTI and if the

442
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:26,799
command does not coincide with and non

443
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:31,570
received command so we get F G H and the

444
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:36,160
server also shows a log that can be that

445
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:40,750
can redirect a file and the same with

446
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:45,100
the three potential or possible commands

447
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:52,120
we can see in the worse act that any of

448
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:57,040
the requests in plain text it will be

449
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:59,740
great to be able to speak about the

450
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,730
whole protocol but there is not enough

451
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:06,700
time is a rather complex protocol but

452
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:08,680
I'm running out of time so this is the

453
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,950
end of my presentation thank you very

454
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,950
much

455
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:24,720
I have a question they'd be directional

456
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:32,339
part have you implemented it yes now in

457
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:39,299
the code there is a different background

458
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:44,250
or context for keys generation server

459
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:50,790
and client have different passwords

460
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:51,359
generation relaxant breathe this is not

461
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:55,130
a test

462
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:59,369
I just like to see it if you can show

463
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:04,020
the handshake part whether it goes one

464
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:08,970
direction or the other the server works

465
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:11,040
as any other server the main gates the

466
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:15,149
settings about the port

467
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:19,279
the rest is optional the file where the

468
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:23,280
key will be read and the process listen

469
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:27,140
if the user has opened up a connection

470
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,750
or the client disconnect the process

471
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:34,859
also disconnects and then we have the

472
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:37,440
while loop if we get a connection we do

473
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:44,598
a fork that will execute the function

474
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:48,200
process request so it allows different

475
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,200
client connections

476
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:58,530
here you have the function process

477
00:38:52,200 --> 00:39:02,189
request we set the context for the

478
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:08,840
creation of random numbers in handshake

479
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:12,359
we do it to generate nouns if we have a

480
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:16,010
specified file we open up this one and

481
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:22,770
instead of using the prefixed one in

482
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:30,350
compilation in the macros defined in the

483
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:34,830
file as dot page we were in server and

484
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:39,180
then we call the handshake function that

485
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:45,840
is defined in the file as dot C this

486
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:54,899
config function just make an exchange of

487
00:39:45,840 --> 00:40:01,730
nouns and to check each message we do a

488
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:08,820
Mac H Mac we because cha-cha is a harsh

489
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:12,450
in itself and touch of three was a house

490
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:15,450
function but we didn't have time we

491
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:20,819
haven't slept all night because we were

492
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:24,930
the struggling with them a is and when

493
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:30,109
everything is set to check the baby keys

494
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:30,109
are correct there's a challenge where

495
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:40,069
if you scroll down you have the function

496
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:44,180
here of the client handshake this is the

497
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:46,700
one that the client executes to execute

498
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:54,970
the handshake with a server so the

499
00:40:46,700 --> 00:41:00,710
client generates an ounce and cents it

500
00:40:54,970 --> 00:41:04,100
first to the feather then sends

501
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,900
different by mentioned the beginning of

502
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:13,040
the session with our protocol and then

503
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:16,580
this non CE Center distance is used to

504
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:23,150
encrypt messages messages will be

505
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:28,970
encrypted using s nonce to break the

506
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:31,490
terminus and the server will generate to

507
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:33,980
generate its keys it will get the nouns

508
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:37,430
used by the client and is going to use

509
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:40,040
it to generate the renounce the cedar is

510
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:41,779
defensive the same passwords or keys

511
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:49,360
will not be generated through those

512
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:55,950
functions and then we check that the

513
00:41:49,360 --> 00:42:02,770
password is correct thank you thank you

514
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:02,770
[Applause]

515
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:14,538
to get up on the people

516
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,350
I'm gonna go

517
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,880

518
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:23,779
I'm ready okay we are the members of the

519
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:29,330
project Harvey Unchained

520
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:32,730
you know us already and I'm going to

521
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:35,279
introduce the contents that will be the

522
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:37,380
first item the starting point of the

523
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,650
project as we explained the first day we

524
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:45,390
will speak about the milestones that we

525
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:49,110
try to achieve during the context the

526
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:54,118
final project based on all suggestions

527
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:59,420
the problems and future improvements the

528
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:03,690
starting point of the project as we said

529
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:06,630
the first day was that we had Twitter

530
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:10,320
with very first monitoring of Twitter

531
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:12,900
profile using the official API and we

532
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:16,770
had a great deal of information that was

533
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:23,310
then realized in a file the idea was to

534
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:27,920
implement it in our platform Alvaro

535
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:31,529
will introduce what is the final project

536
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:35,490
once we introduced Twitter the rest of

537
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:38,580
the social media as one said we started

538
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:42,450
with Twitter and we wanted to add at

539
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:50,880
least Instagram a little bit of Facebook

540
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:52,919
and also Internet the milestones here in

541
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,380
the context this is what we've been

542
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,570
working on the last few days in

543
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,600
Instagram we got the basic profile

544
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:03,210
information and the latest pictures

545
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:06,150
published and the main data about

546
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:08,670
comments and likes then we could get a

547
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,940
location we wanted to get location about

548
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:15,000
the picture but we didn't have time

549
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:18,750
about Facebook we selected the friends

550
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:21,760
from a profile the latest posts

551
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:24,580
information from the world everything

552
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,450
that is mentioned and then basic profile

553
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:34,600
information with the world live about

554
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:37,720
Twitter monitor all information from a

555
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:43,860
target is tracked or publication banners

556
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,859
images and about past vini we aromatize

557
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:58,330
search using search and we've also used

558
00:45:50,620 --> 00:46:00,460
I feeI from past event to get data all

559
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:05,230
of this he's been integrated in a

560
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:07,690
dashboard to you and enhance the analyst

561
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:09,400
the viewing of the information in a

562
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:12,250
simple and clear way even though they

563
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:15,820
may not have a clear technical knowledge

564
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:22,090
they may understand it and now we will

565
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:27,460
speak about each of the social media as

566
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:31,960
you can see the project has been modular

567
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:34,990
we have been developing different parts

568
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:38,590
I was responsible for Twitter this is

569
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:41,589
all the information from the profiles

570
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:44,380
what we thought it was most important is

571
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:48,370
general information that allow us to

572
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:51,190
view it in a nice way in the platform

573
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:54,520
once this was a structure we just

574
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:58,930
inserted it in a database and then to

575
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:02,710
the platform visually speaking I will

576
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:07,810
show a video about the platform but this

577
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:11,880
is just a screenshot of a Twitter and

578
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:16,720
those are the registers latest tweets

579
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:19,720
the activity and whether I found

580
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,259
tweeting from different locations this

581
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:26,410
is also seen here now my colleague

582
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:28,700
Alvaro will introduce the part related

583
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,799
to Instagram

584
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,419
in Sangram on twitter the number of

585
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:34,250
follow information is the number of

586
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:38,089
followers those that are followed and

587
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:42,049
the latest images comments and likes

588
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:46,000
which photograph and we could expand it

589
00:47:42,049 --> 00:47:49,849
to specific comments of each picture

590
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:55,579
location etc and now we're going to move

591
00:47:49,849 --> 00:48:00,829
to Facebook running out of time in

592
00:47:55,579 --> 00:48:04,880
facebook basic information user

593
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:11,089
information the latest posts in the

594
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:16,420
world and all the friends this is a

595
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:22,250
small demo of the script that executes

596
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:24,859
another together all the friends will

597
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:28,849
use the system to automatically task and

598
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:32,720
recognize an image so that it works in

599
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:36,170
any laptop device depending on the pixel

600
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,000
and we can substitute the manual work to

601
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,589
the analyst so the script does

602
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,510
everything because this is the mobile

603
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:49,490
version is to include all the friends

604
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:51,559
from a user and once is finished this

605
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,290
part is executed it gets information

606
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:59,030
about all difference in the URL and the

607
00:48:54,290 --> 00:49:01,210
information is into a file that can be

608
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:04,269
uploaded

609
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,269
[Music]

610
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:11,040
the dashboard the we have three ways of

611
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:12,750
functioning biography posts on friends

612
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,279
this is information about the latest

613
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:20,190
post from the target and now information

614
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,010
about the biography we have implemented

615
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:26,010
three methods so far but this is a

616
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:29,730
scalpel from Facebook through scrapping

617
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:35,730
we can use and get all information we

618
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:38,220
need and it's been totally random and

619
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:42,900
this person is not my former girlfriend

620
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:46,080
and this is the file with information

621
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,150
from all friends that then goes through

622
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:54,330
Python to the database

623
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:57,330
I will pick up the paste bin as my

624
00:49:54,330 --> 00:50:00,600
colleague said we've been use insert is

625
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:04,440
asserted that the searches in Google and

626
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:06,630
open source and paste bin we might have

627
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:10,440
the keywords of the target that we will

628
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:13,470
introduce to the database related to

629
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,210
each user and that depend on our

630
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:18,240
interest once the analysis is carried

631
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:23,640
out which show the results of the admin

632
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:25,680
here we have found 313 posts then we

633
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:31,109
have the things to passive in and the

634
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:33,779
URL in Google here oh this is a an

635
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:36,900
example of the script we start off with

636
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:41,010
two keywords admin and hacker we will

637
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:44,160
get all the paste bins the new URL for

638
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:47,940
each keyword once we do this there will

639
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:50,879
be as lead after searching for all

640
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:54,240
keywords then we dynamically introduce

641
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,190
new two keywords and we start the

642
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,350
process again this is an automatic

643
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:01,950
process that is running in the server

644
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:06,410
and as we introduce new keywords in the

645
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:06,410
database they are automatically analyzed

646
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:15,109
and now not just a demo we have prepare

647
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:19,420
a video of the dashboard this is their

648
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:29,000
index with our objectives the keywords

649
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:32,300
users then forma for the new target it

650
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:35,240
will be user data and the social media

651
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:38,359
we're going to monitor as we see in

652
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:43,339
example twitter facebook instagram and

653
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:45,590
is a scalable to any platform then we

654
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:50,060
have the current targets that are

655
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:54,380
already in and actions to view more

656
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:56,960
about the profile here we could get in a

657
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:59,720
chess pacific profile the information we

658
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:06,460
have in facebook is a small facebook

659
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:06,459
biography latest posts and my friends

660
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,940
section

661
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:24,810
now Twitter to the description picture

662
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:27,540
the banner followers for you to its

663
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:29,640
latest do its recent activity and a

664
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,279
small timeline that is although is not

665
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:54,450
implemented yet that's a way would look

666
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:58,970
like the same about the Instagram we

667
00:52:54,450 --> 00:53:02,370
have added bottom do launch the scripts

668
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:05,959
in an automatic mode in Twitter the

669
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:08,670
number of tweets whether we won't do

670
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:12,600
monitor it on an ongoing basis that are

671
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:15,390
still pending to be implemented but it

672
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:19,740
would just be a matter of launching the

673
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:23,819
script from PHP and then to add keywords

674
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:31,649
as cyber camp and we can see their

675
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:35,430
results I know that we are behind the

676
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:39,480
ten minutes but the api's didn't bring

677
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:41,359
enough information tools integration was

678
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:46,680
more complex than we thought especially

679
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:49,020
Facebook we just had two days so it was

680
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:53,509
not time enough to implement everything

681
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:56,009
and the solutions proposed by our peers

682
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:59,040
took some time and we had to implement

683
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:02,850
it as feature improvements is to

684
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,250
integrate the platform in OVA local this

685
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:08,040
is one of their recommendations by the

686
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:10,800
jury and we think that is rather

687
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:13,250
interesting to integrate new platforms

688
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,290
as you can see on the screen to improve

689
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:18,880
Facebook data extraction and updating

690
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:21,430
and eliminating information in it

691
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,790
dynamic manner thank you very much sorry

692
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:30,370
for going a little bit too beyond the

693
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:35,110
time if you have any questions now dan

694
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:39,069
is going to ask something just to look

695
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:41,470
go to ask for something ready to the

696
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:44,160
goat but we don't have to do it now you

697
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,160
can talk to Danny

698
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:05,170
actually means you know Jimmy

699
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:07,380
CICS should look like a man tell you I

700
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,380
don't know

701
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:40,770
Oh Yolo - a todos somos ladyboy hello

702
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:45,080
good morning we're here to talk to you

703
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:47,700
about the results of the Droid Sentinel

704
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:51,779
application but it's the main goal of

705
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:54,779
our tool to decide a tool that's able to

706
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:58,820
determine whether our device is being

707
00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:03,690
part of distributed denial of service

708
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:06,800
attack we want to introduce pattern

709
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:10,589
recognizing and machine learning also

710
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:12,599
identify denial of service attacks that

711
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:14,910
are more and more common and we want to

712
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:17,550
promote the cooperation of the community

713
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:20,580
we want to create an Corps that can be

714
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:25,160
able to detect whether a device is being

715
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:28,230
part about an hour service attack we've

716
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,450
selected Android and a mobile phone but

717
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:32,910
we can do it with virtually everything

718
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:36,299
what were the challenges what do we know

719
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:40,430
when we began monitoring techniques on

720
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:42,530
top decision-making and prevention

721
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:47,279
self-organization of networks and

722
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:49,980
taxonomies of denial of service and very

723
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,690
relationship with botnets what part did

724
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:55,589
we encounter during the deployment of

725
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:58,349
this outgoing traffic and us as we come

726
00:56:55,589 --> 00:57:00,210
in from a model in which we're at the

727
00:56:58,349 --> 00:57:02,940
center of a network and we analyze all

728
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:05,490
the traffic but in this case we're only

729
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:07,980
analyzing the outgoing traffic of a

730
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:10,649
device and this is very ominous because

731
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:12,750
we use the same ten or fifteen after

732
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:16,470
have very similar in constant traffic

733
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:20,430
second analysis of non stationary data

734
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:22,980
what is this about the data from the

735
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:25,799
data center as we worked in their past

736
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:28,140
our stationary are more or less

737
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:30,450
recognizable have a series of patterns

738
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:32,790
but not in this case maybe you have your

739
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:36,210
mobile phone and rest mode or you don't

740
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:38,190
load an app and you and play streaming

741
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:40,530
there are many peaks and it's very hard

742
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:42,900
to identify patterns and then Glenn or

743
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:44,970
Glenn or granularity what does this

744
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:50,160
refer to our series

745
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:53,189
are sometimes not too big or our

746
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,580
algorithms rather require very long in

747
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:59,460
series that's what makes predictions

748
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:04,470
more accurate since this is a hackathon

749
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:06,930
and we had a time restraint we had to go

750
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:09,240
for a more restricted time series how do

751
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:12,868
we face these challenges and above the

752
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:16,259
app first analysis of outgoing traffic

753
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:20,730
both legitimate and malicious second

754
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:23,160
unexpected behavior third study of only

755
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:26,480
Authority or randomness through an

756
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:29,819
entropy and fourth calibration and fifth

757
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:32,609
measurement and points three four and

758
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:35,490
five is where we find more innovation in

759
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:38,220
our projects ie the core of our project

760
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:42,868
that were in that part where most of the

761
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:45,180
research lies in the first part we need

762
00:58:42,869 --> 00:58:48,990
to determine whether it's malicious or

763
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:52,348
legitimate traffic based on the chair

764
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:55,729
we've finally gone for this approach to

765
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:59,460
determine whether the packages are

766
00:58:55,730 --> 00:59:03,830
legitimate or malicious second detection

767
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:06,540
of unexpected behavior to do so we based

768
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:09,810
ourselves on three pieces of info on

769
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:12,450
packages the number of flows the average

770
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:16,080
and maximum number of packages and third

771
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:20,399
the size of packages we don't work

772
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:24,270
directly on this we use metric entropy

773
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:27,440
entropy measures the level of dispersion

774
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:31,320
of data the probability or likeness of

775
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,550
dispersion is a dispersion of data we've

776
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:36,599
used to descend

777
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:39,030
Ricky's entropy but as we used it we

778
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:42,810
understood that there are different

779
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:45,570
options and we finally end X an answer

780
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:49,290
entropy and we thought that this was the

781
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:51,490
best option calibration Y calibration of

782
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:54,279
algorithms why

783
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:56,169
singing a generic algorithm we're

784
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,720
talking about non-stationary data there

785
00:59:56,170 --> 01:00:02,020
are no patters are very few feathers

786
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:05,439
between the observations this forces us

787
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:08,110
to calibrate and reset them each time

788
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,460
differently and to adapt ourselves to

789
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:15,160
the time series that's why we use

790
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:17,920
genetic algorithm that simulates the

791
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:20,200
evolution of the species ie natural

792
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,530
selection what it does in a semo's

793
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:26,790
cheese and creates a population the end

794
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:30,310
population which would be the optimum

795
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:32,920
population each chromosome represents a

796
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:34,750
possible configuration of an algorithm

797
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,760
so we're looking for the optimal

798
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:40,270
configuration or setting for the

799
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:44,200
algorithm and to this and we use smarter

800
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:48,190
which is a measure that helps us know

801
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:51,549
which of the chromosomes are better and

802
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:55,060
then algorithms we've had a lot of work

803
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:57,609
to do we didn't want to limit ourselves

804
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:59,830
to one sole our goal is in rhythm we

805
01:00:57,609 --> 01:01:02,259
work with five different algorithms and

806
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:04,540
we use genetic algorithms for each

807
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:08,170
calibrated them tested them the time

808
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:14,470
series vary a great deal so we wanted to

809
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:18,730
choose the algorithm that best responded

810
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:22,779
to the time series and we went for the

811
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:27,190
triple smooth exponential algorithm and

812
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:29,290
the decision criteria and why do how do

813
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:33,280
we know whether they have been anomalies

814
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:34,779
or not well adapted to thresholds what

815
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:39,690
are interpretive fish

816
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:42,310
these are margins where we expect the

817
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:46,010
prediction to be to the right and it's a

818
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:49,880
bit hard to see we have an explanation

819
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:53,810
The Times uses the blue line and the red

820
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:57,440
and green line represent the adaptive

821
01:01:53,810 --> 01:02:00,049
threshold upper and low and we see that

822
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:02,990
generally we're within thresholds but at

823
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:04,490
a particular moment in time we go beyond

824
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:07,040
their thresholds and it is here where

825
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:09,020
our tool comes into play and says there

826
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:12,470
is a numbness traffic there's something

827
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:15,920
there and we are reported about a

828
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:19,640
potential TOS let's move on to the demo

829
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:24,110
to this end we've developed our app

830
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:26,740
we've used an Android emulator it's

831
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:30,800
running already for the sake of time

832
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:34,490
first thing it's take observations or

833
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:39,320
make observation needs to feed itself so

834
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:43,100
it's going to take 20 observations to be

835
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:47,750
able to start to predict this parameter

836
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:50,950
as many others it can be customized here

837
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:53,630
we've introduced only four because

838
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:56,359
didn't make much sense to introduce more

839
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:58,280
and for an average user and we

840
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,440
introduced 20 or 30 because that's

841
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:02,650
possible it would be perhaps too

842
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:07,520
overwhelming so this is the interface

843
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:10,360
and the idea is to implement advanced

844
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:13,970
options for advanced users so that

845
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:17,540
instead of maybe four you can have 20

846
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:19,939
and this would have users and developers

847
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:23,000
have move on and know what they need to

848
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:25,850
focus on so what are we going to see

849
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,720
with this demo well too

850
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:33,440
the left you have just a lot a lock so

851
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:35,569
that you see that it is executing vm and

852
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,400
now it's going to start to predict we're

853
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:42,850
going to start to see prediction values

854
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:42,850
they were already all in three and one

855
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:48,529
normalized entropy as you will see and

856
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:50,990
we're going to see how it generates

857
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:53,600
predictions and what we're going to do

858
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:56,180
is use Loy 2 which is a tool that you

859
01:03:53,600 --> 01:04:02,750
probably know in order to generate a do

860
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:06,140
s attack okay we're not going to crush

861
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:08,660
any website and we're going to see takes

862
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:11,240
some time because it's making

863
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:15,259
observation but soon we'll see how our

864
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:18,589
report is going to be issued to tell us

865
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:30,320
that we may be subject to distributed

866
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:35,240
TOS here we have 24 this is the value of

867
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:40,730
24 and now we're going to activate our

868
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:44,089
tool we're going to introduce whatever

869
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:46,360
website and we're going to see how this

870
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,360
works

871
01:04:57,589 --> 01:05:02,900
good now we're going to launch the

872
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,430
attack it's starting it's not dangerous

873
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:09,869
dangerous we're not going to crash the

874
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:14,489
website see how we have the reporters to

875
01:05:09,869 --> 01:05:16,529
be notified and we've just been warned

876
01:05:14,489 --> 01:05:19,650
that there has been an anomalous change

877
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:22,319
in the time series and therefore it's

878
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:32,130
possible that we're being part of the OS

879
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:34,650
attack and conclusions core

880
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:37,769
functionalities were able to have a core

881
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:39,869
that it takes the OS attacks work but

882
01:05:37,769 --> 01:05:41,488
your predictions using genetic

883
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:44,609
algorithms and entropy

884
01:05:41,489 --> 01:05:47,190
second test scenario as we have seen and

885
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:51,150
validation of the proposal we were able

886
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:52,979
to do or satisfy our objectives future

887
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:55,950
work optimization of code to make it

888
01:05:52,979 --> 01:05:57,960
more efficient scalability as who are

889
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:59,968
saying this has been done for mobile

890
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:02,969
phones but are ideas that can be used

891
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:08,279
for whatever IOT device and computers

892
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:13,619
etc updating of SDK you mentioned this

893
01:06:08,279 --> 01:06:17,009
is an issue of dating that would take us

894
01:06:13,619 --> 01:06:23,880
some time we decided to leave this for

895
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:25,589
the future and the AMF report we talked

896
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:28,019
about possibility of issuing a report

897
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:31,140
that could be sent so that the community

898
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:34,439
could have access to that and we set a

899
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:37,019
standard an ID MF and we implemented it

900
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:40,940
is still not uploaded and that's work

901
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:40,939
for the future thank you

902
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:44,520
[Applause]

903
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,859
Widow

904
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:48,990
nobody middle city see that I like to

905
01:06:46,859 --> 01:06:52,560
congratulate you for the work you've

906
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:55,740
done the research s being wonderful

907
01:06:52,560 --> 01:07:00,170
you've explained this very well just a

908
01:06:55,740 --> 01:07:04,919
technical question when you detect

909
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:08,640
threshold to you enter that value to

910
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:14,640
feed in the algorithm so that it can

911
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:16,250
learn from that and maybe it maths real

912
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,170
attacked

913
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:22,230
yes that's correct when we see that

914
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:24,840
there's a peak value when the time

915
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:27,840
series advances that value is going to

916
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:30,119
be detected and all our algorithm is

917
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:33,300
going to reuse it for the next

918
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:37,650
prediction so yes as for the threshold

919
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:41,490
threshold is adaptive so which each new

920
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:46,849
iteration is modified way with each new

921
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:46,848
observation the thresholds are adapted

922
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,260
my kid

923
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:44,840
good morning we are new products our

924
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:50,730
crew and we're here to explain to you

925
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:53,550
our experience with our tool mall Trail

926
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:56,569
let's remind you what this is about it's

927
01:08:53,550 --> 01:09:00,600
a very simple architecture sensor

928
01:08:56,569 --> 01:09:02,910
customer the sensor will be in traffic

929
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:06,600
concentration point we'll send it to the

930
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:11,220
server and the server will be a website

931
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:14,460
where you can see all this we've wanted

932
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:18,360
to add a new sensor our process sensor

933
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:22,380
that is executed meet hot so that we can

934
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:26,069
correlate the malicious sensor detected

935
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:30,150
by this traffic sensor and process

936
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:32,729
sensors so what Montreal detects are and

937
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:39,450
also a small button that says kill and

938
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:41,580
that kills it well we had here was the

939
01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:43,889
secure communication between the host

940
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:46,080
and the server because we're talking

941
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:48,870
about a package that can kill whatever

942
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:52,680
process so you need to secure this and

943
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:55,110
we've talked with it just such a team

944
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:57,510
and we thought about implementing their

945
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:59,790
solution they checked Python which is

946
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:02,400
what we work with and we checked their

947
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:05,430
upon fashion LEDs and in the end we

948
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:08,099
didn't implement it because we had would

949
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:11,870
have to call our Python code from their

950
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,870
PC and

951
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:19,330
and what we saw was that they could get

952
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:24,639
a package and reinjected as many times

953
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:26,889
as possible and we could kill PIB as

954
01:10:24,639 --> 01:10:30,060
many times as possible and that is

955
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:34,480
dangerous so unfortunately Indian we had

956
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:38,070
to use SSL that classical architecture

957
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:41,280
there's an authentication by the

958
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:44,799
customer and by the server with

959
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:48,550
certificates the main problem to detect

960
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:51,369
a PID is related to packages this seems

961
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:54,040
simple but it turned out being very

962
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:55,929
complicated but the most difficult is

963
01:10:54,040 --> 01:11:00,159
that you need to treat with very low

964
01:10:55,929 --> 01:11:03,760
level ie in the case of line ups the

965
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:05,949
currently in the case of the next we

966
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:09,280
have the audit framework that has some

967
01:11:05,949 --> 01:11:11,678
rules for each call to the system so we

968
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:14,110
introduced a rule for a socket connect

969
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:17,050
that we have our PID we long at all and

970
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:19,809
windows has some more complicated net

971
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:22,300
events session nobody understands what

972
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:24,429
this is about it's something that has to

973
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:26,139
do with a PowerShell you were laughing

974
01:11:24,429 --> 01:11:29,349
the other day but it's really

975
01:11:26,139 --> 01:11:33,369
complicated it's really tough it's just

976
01:11:29,349 --> 01:11:36,820
this power or shell and audit framework

977
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:40,630
it's a bit Messier man Mac there's

978
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:44,440
something funny they introduced the data

979
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:46,879
we need regarding the packages and this

980
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:50,358
isn't release to the Internet

981
01:11:46,879 --> 01:11:52,189
but that's basically it and we can read

982
01:11:50,359 --> 01:11:55,899
it from there and we see the same

983
01:11:52,189 --> 01:12:03,019
behavior and last a general one Python

984
01:11:55,899 --> 01:12:07,309
Python so you can plug in a Python and

985
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:10,010
use these of plugging and if you ask us

986
01:12:07,309 --> 01:12:12,769
who sent this we can check our table

987
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:15,679
maybe the socket is open we can say this

988
01:12:12,769 --> 01:12:17,419
if it the circuit is closed we won't be

989
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:21,320
able to know that and that's it on my

990
01:12:17,419 --> 01:12:23,179
side now we will show you the demo my

991
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:27,438
colleague Carlos will be in charge of

992
01:12:23,179 --> 01:12:29,449
explaining the Deemer to you let's move

993
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:31,550
on to the demo first thing I'm going to

994
01:12:29,449 --> 01:12:33,228
do is explain to you what we're going to

995
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:35,959
do this team uh so that you don't get

996
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:37,879
lost we're going to test three different

997
01:12:35,959 --> 01:12:40,280
architecture and we're going to capture

998
01:12:37,879 --> 01:12:43,189
three types of packages the three main

999
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:45,409
protocols UDP TCP will know you can see

1000
01:12:43,189 --> 01:12:47,570
the three and these three types of

1001
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:51,409
protocols although the packages can be

1002
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:54,590
detected in the process sensor of linux

1003
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:57,978
and mac and windows however for a sake

1004
01:12:54,590 --> 01:13:01,219
of time we're going to capture on ICMP

1005
01:12:57,979 --> 01:13:04,639
and mac UDP and linux and tcp and

1006
01:13:01,219 --> 01:13:07,729
windows ok we're going to use three

1007
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:10,550
different architects within mac we will

1008
01:13:07,729 --> 01:13:15,010
be executing both the server and this

1009
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:17,929
sensor and the process sensor from mac

1010
01:13:15,010 --> 01:13:21,469
within the Mac machine we will have a

1011
01:13:17,929 --> 01:13:25,159
virtual Linux machine the hoos packages

1012
01:13:21,469 --> 01:13:27,530
will always go through mac interfaces

1013
01:13:25,159 --> 01:13:30,228
and we'll use the secretary sensor we

1014
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:32,239
are executing in mac and we will be able

1015
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:34,749
to view the packages in the mac server

1016
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:37,699
and third we're going to test a third

1017
01:13:34,749 --> 01:13:39,978
architecture we will have a Windows

1018
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:42,619
machine in the same local network but

1019
01:13:39,979 --> 01:13:45,489
not being executed within Mac but

1020
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:48,369
executing its own sensor

1021
01:13:45,489 --> 01:13:51,218
this window said device will establish a

1022
01:13:48,369 --> 01:13:53,768
TCP connection with a malicious IP the

1023
01:13:51,219 --> 01:13:56,199
sensor will detect this malicious

1024
01:13:53,769 --> 01:13:58,869
connection will send a love to the

1025
01:13:56,199 --> 01:14:01,900
server the server will talk with the

1026
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:04,630
process successor of Windows and will

1027
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:10,210
send it the idea of the process of

1028
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:14,499
they'sa package so now let's take a look

1029
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:18,730
at the real demo as I said let's begin

1030
01:14:14,499 --> 01:14:23,980
with Mac we're executing the server the

1031
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:25,989
process sensor and the mall trail sensor

1032
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:28,989
that detects malicious packages so

1033
01:14:25,989 --> 01:14:31,869
inside the man we're going to send a pin

1034
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:34,718
to a malicious IP check whether it's

1035
01:14:31,869 --> 01:14:37,329
being executed and kill the process for

1036
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:39,730
the mall trade token so here we have the

1037
01:14:37,329 --> 01:14:42,400
mall trail core so with previous traces

1038
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:43,928
so that we can see how everything is

1039
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,900
being done but now we're going to create

1040
01:14:43,929 --> 01:14:49,239
a new process let me highlight that

1041
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:52,030
we've added three columns so in this

1042
01:14:49,239 --> 01:14:54,280
console process ID process name and kill

1043
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:56,889
process the goal of which is to kill the

1044
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,630
process see the name of the process the

1045
01:14:56,889 --> 01:15:02,980
name of the malicious package and the

1046
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:05,710
PID this teams but if you read the code

1047
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:08,049
of mantra creator it was interesting to

1048
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:09,690
know how he did all this in order to

1049
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:12,510
develop

1050
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:15,330
and this allowed us to order the

1051
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:18,570
packages based on the PID or the process

1052
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:21,659
so we send a PIN number with the macro

1053
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:24,509
machine we sends a pin to the lower

1054
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:28,049
right console it's being sent well it's

1055
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:33,889
received we're going to update the mall

1056
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:37,500
trail console and we're going to see

1057
01:15:33,889 --> 01:15:39,780
will you take a look at the console when

1058
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:44,400
we press kill we're going to kill the

1059
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:49,380
process it has died well as you can see

1060
01:15:44,400 --> 01:16:02,730
here now let's move on to MINIX to the

1061
01:15:49,380 --> 01:16:06,330
demo in linux more entertaining we have

1062
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:10,650
the process sensor and running and we

1063
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:12,900
were going to do a routine to a

1064
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:15,750
malicious site so when I press the

1065
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:18,388
button I will have to look for the

1066
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:23,580
process and kill it before it finishes

1067
01:16:18,389 --> 01:16:26,940
so let's see how this goes we take a

1068
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:29,880
look we have killed the process well and

1069
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:33,030
now we can read they're killed

1070
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:37,889
it's being killed before the traceroute

1071
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:41,550
is finished good untie now let's move on

1072
01:16:37,889 --> 01:16:44,780
to the windows demo in which you will be

1073
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:48,449
able to see that we run from issue

1074
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:51,840
requests to a malicious site we're going

1075
01:16:48,449 --> 01:16:54,360
to find that request within the mall

1076
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,179
trail console and we're going to see

1077
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:59,670
life how the chrome process that is

1078
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:01,940
being executed in the cathedral fascia

1079
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:07,400
and the screen of this computer is

1080
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:10,129
killed from the mall trail console

1081
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:14,360
there's no connectivity with the

1082
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:19,340
militias well because the malicious web

1083
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:24,730
does marketing and as you can see we can

1084
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:28,580
kill it perfectly well that's report

1085
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:30,349
here it is wonderful we're going to

1086
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:32,390
press kill but take a look at this

1087
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:43,070
screen so that you see how the chrome

1088
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:46,850
process is killed as you can see we have

1089
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:49,910
also managed this error let's see were

1090
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:54,530
able to find the correct process for

1091
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:56,330
doing this via mobile let's see we're

1092
01:17:54,530 --> 01:18:03,170
able to find it and killed it

1093
01:17:56,330 --> 01:18:06,290
kill it well emotion Blvd Fiona the

1094
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:08,240
request has been sent to the process

1095
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:16,490
sensor of Windows but we're going to

1096
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:23,240
restart windows process sensor I said

1097
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:27,490
that Windows was a bit Messier and using

1098
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:27,490
pythons PowerShell isn't easy either

1099
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:34,370
we have it ready

1100
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:46,450
you've sent the request we're waiting

1101
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:54,900
for to receive the process we're logging

1102
01:18:46,450 --> 01:19:02,950
everything here it is we refresh

1103
01:18:54,900 --> 01:19:05,259
mulwray's web so we press kill and we

1104
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:09,070
close it correctly you complete the

1105
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:13,840
process you've exceeded our time sorry

1106
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:17,740
for that and thank you everybody I have

1107
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:20,560
a question during how long have you

1108
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:23,580
trained the trace roots and move your

1109
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:27,520
fingers to press kill a couple of times

1110
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:30,100
it's been quite a race she said of the

1111
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:32,880
demo use the mobile point of access

1112
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:35,500
setting the structure took us a

1113
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:40,330
significant part of last night so you

1114
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:42,910
can't imagine well the ideas that it can

1115
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:45,610
be automatically implemented with

1116
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:48,730
severity rules evil if the processes

1117
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:52,440
killed automatically well this demo of

1118
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:52,440
course wouldn't make any sense

1119
01:19:55,460 --> 01:20:01,770
this can be implemented as a future

1120
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:05,490
enhancement in the future the automatic

1121
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:12,930
killing of processes we do have time to

1122
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:16,349
do this and to have don't have the kill

1123
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:20,390
button activated if the processes it has

1124
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:20,390
already been killed thank you

1125
01:20:44,869 --> 01:20:48,469
let's say that Jimmy

1126
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:21,170
[Music]

1127
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:57,420
hola hey hello good morning my name is

1128
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:59,220
Javier I'm part of cyberwar team and

1129
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:01,200
first of all like to explain to you the

1130
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:03,870
development of our idea from the

1131
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:06,269
beginning of the hackathon till now

1132
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:09,540
because if we consider the comments made

1133
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:12,690
by the jury and we change course

1134
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:15,360
somehow initially we wanted to search

1135
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:17,460
osing by entering the full name of a

1136
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:21,269
person and the city where that person

1137
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:25,530
lives and our to show the internet links

1138
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:27,600
where the info on that person was

1139
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:31,620
located and whether we had found

1140
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:34,560
sensitive info for example I couldn't

1141
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:37,130
make background employment background

1142
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:40,940
and we wanted to add further criteria

1143
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:49,230
this night we've included yet another

1144
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:53,669
search a criterion also search regarding

1145
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:57,379
the user address it's true that we've

1146
01:22:53,670 --> 01:23:00,240
identified or face a series of reverse

1147
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:02,430
specifically with the ideas my colleague

1148
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:04,980
will explain also promised regarding the

1149
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:07,590
execution times for the matching of data

1150
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:11,309
because we don't only obtain data once

1151
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:14,820
we have that data we run analysis

1152
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:19,290
algorithms on them to try to obtain info

1153
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:22,049
from those data sources more filtered in

1154
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:23,820
form or screened info and that has first

1155
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:25,860
problems but in terms of scalability

1156
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:28,590
should we have time we would be able to

1157
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:31,799
fine-tune the algorithms and obtain

1158
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:34,230
further data and a more search criteria

1159
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:37,670
one of our ideas for the future is to

1160
01:23:34,230 --> 01:23:41,190
introduce a function whereby the data

1161
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:43,579
collected are then implemented a PDF

1162
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:47,540
didn't have time to do this

1163
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:51,079
another idea that we have in mind is

1164
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:54,619
that when we do a research it can be

1165
01:23:51,079 --> 01:23:57,530
stored in the database our database only

1166
01:23:54,619 --> 01:24:01,989
stores in one search but the idea to

1167
01:23:57,530 --> 01:24:04,699
have a historical log of the search

1168
01:24:01,989 --> 01:24:08,230
that's an idea for the future as well

1169
01:24:04,699 --> 01:24:11,269
and I'll give the floor to my colleague

1170
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:15,230
with cyber watch of what we wanted

1171
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:17,389
initially as my clinic said we wanted to

1172
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:20,000
conduct a search and that whatever

1173
01:24:17,389 --> 01:24:22,010
person could do this anybody the problem

1174
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,619
was that we couldn't ensure the security

1175
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:27,980
of only looking for the data on that

1176
01:24:24,619 --> 01:24:32,199
person in particular and not everybody

1177
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:35,839
the jury gave us some advice to have

1178
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:37,909
security backed certificate backed

1179
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,730
security and we decided to use the

1180
01:24:37,909 --> 01:24:42,980
electronic idea with a USB the drive

1181
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:49,610
problems we had to carry out two

1182
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:55,459
processes the Spanish national well the

1183
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:58,820
mint issues the ID and works with the

1184
01:24:55,460 --> 01:25:02,119
law-enforcement agencies and we thought

1185
01:24:58,820 --> 01:25:04,639
ok what if I find a place where this

1186
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:07,610
process that can be done by myself and

1187
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:10,329
that's when we were able to find this

1188
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:10,329
company

1189
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:23,710
Tracie's it's hard to see practice is a

1190
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:26,010
company that does validation with the

1191
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:33,940
spanish mint and with the local police

1192
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:36,870
and this company works with all these

1193
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:40,120
certificates that you can see from Spain

1194
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:43,180
and other countries as well and we can

1195
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:44,620
see how with Spain there's a specific

1196
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:50,440
section there works with the local

1197
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:53,820
police okay

1198
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:56,849
we're aware of this so

1199
01:25:53,820 --> 01:26:00,330
now I'd like to show you a demo with my

1200
01:25:56,850 --> 01:26:04,890
ID document first they ask me for an

1201
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:08,790
authorization because it's gonna use my

1202
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:11,190
date I say yes access and then it Dell

1203
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:14,280
notes an applet that will be installed

1204
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:18,240
in my computer which is this one that

1205
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:27,900
you can see here I need to of course

1206
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:35,519
accept I open the link now it's going to

1207
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:39,540
ask me for the password I'm going to try

1208
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:41,970
to combine both screens so I'm being

1209
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:43,920
asked to introduce the password for the

1210
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:45,870
certificate I'll introduce my ID number

1211
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:51,600
but there was a problem with the police

1212
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:53,610
so the IDS with specific support number

1213
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,620
had been attacked and deactivated I

1214
01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:58,469
didn't have time to go to the police to

1215
01:26:55,620 --> 01:27:00,840
renew the certificates so the app is

1216
01:26:58,470 --> 01:27:07,350
going to tell me that I won't be able to

1217
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:12,770
access here you can see that I cannot

1218
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:12,770
access how can we do a demo well

1219
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:31,380
what my colleague said them the idea was

1220
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:33,360
a surger than anybody could use and

1221
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:36,300
through the certificate user could only

1222
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:40,769
find data related to the public part of

1223
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:42,600
his or her digital footprint without

1224
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:44,640
giving this possibility to anyone else

1225
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:50,610
so we keep security measures that

1226
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:54,480
respect everyone's privacy here it was a

1227
01:27:50,610 --> 01:27:58,230
previous search and here we emulate that

1228
01:27:54,480 --> 01:28:08,000
the full name could be collected from

1229
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:11,339
the ID now we see the login screen and

1230
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:13,650
everything I presented about the

1231
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:18,470
certificate here we have the code about

1232
01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:23,969
the certificate implementation in G hub

1233
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:27,750
here working with an API related to my

1234
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:30,690
Strato server and then we do the

1235
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:33,030
emulation where the full name would come

1236
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:38,339
from the idea and the user will only

1237
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:41,929
have to type the city from a list or the

1238
01:28:38,340 --> 01:28:46,290
item extracts which are the rest of

1239
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:48,870
potential searches as sides venues and

1240
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:52,080
this is going to be now the simulation

1241
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:55,410
I'm going to type my colleagues name

1242
01:28:52,080 --> 01:29:03,510
Xavier Monica a hero is not seen on the

1243
01:28:55,410 --> 01:29:05,239
screen now here Monica be a hero now the

1244
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:11,719
city's

1245
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:19,049
Sadako's and his at present are a gym I

1246
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:23,070
said find and the analysis would start

1247
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:26,340
the data collection until the final

1248
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:28,679
results when you introduce the name of

1249
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:32,099
the person the city and the criteria me

1250
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:35,820
there is a search with those criteria we

1251
01:29:32,099 --> 01:29:40,110
get Internet data and then we filtered

1252
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:43,409
whether the data are really there then

1253
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:46,768
we applied an analysis algorithm to find

1254
01:29:43,409 --> 01:29:51,329
possible locations in the text we have a

1255
01:29:46,769 --> 01:29:56,999
database with cities of the world if in

1256
01:29:51,329 --> 01:29:59,308
this register with website text we find

1257
01:29:56,999 --> 01:30:03,300
any of the cities that is in our cities

1258
01:29:59,309 --> 01:30:05,789
list then maybe some of the cities in on

1259
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:08,610
the database are not real cities so we

1260
01:30:05,789 --> 01:30:11,789
have another algorithm for a second

1261
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:16,259
checking that browsers Internet to see

1262
01:30:11,789 --> 01:30:20,659
whether the city is a real location we

1263
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:23,959
also have data analysis algorithm to

1264
01:30:20,659 --> 01:30:29,969
structure email

1265
01:30:23,959 --> 01:30:36,179
relatedly internet browsing and SQL

1266
01:30:29,969 --> 01:30:40,019
query we can see if any of the worlds

1267
01:30:36,179 --> 01:30:43,530
present in our dictionary or inside the

1268
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:46,889
registry we have as I said a table is a

1269
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:49,110
dictionary it has a field and the name

1270
01:30:46,889 --> 01:30:54,479
is field and then we add a value we have

1271
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:59,148
the field whether it is a school course

1272
01:30:54,479 --> 01:31:03,119
activity subject mathematics and if it

1273
01:30:59,149 --> 01:31:06,449
inside this dictionary we introduced it

1274
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:10,228
in possible studies in addition to these

1275
01:31:06,449 --> 01:31:14,369
we show risk percentage

1276
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:19,860
once the fair water is completed that

1277
01:31:14,369 --> 01:31:23,009
estimates the relation of sensitive

1278
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:26,699
Internet information based on the total

1279
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:30,900
data received here you can see in the

1280
01:31:26,699 --> 01:31:34,860
map possible locations of this joint

1281
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:37,799
search and we see the links where the

1282
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:42,739
information is present and we see

1283
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:46,229
whether we have found emails or not and

1284
01:31:42,739 --> 01:31:49,650
in the lower part will show the level of

1285
01:31:46,229 --> 01:31:51,749
risk based on sensitive information we

1286
01:31:49,650 --> 01:31:57,348
didn't have time to add a graph to make

1287
01:31:51,749 --> 01:32:00,869
it more visual but we have the value

1288
01:31:57,349 --> 01:32:04,530
this is not finished yet we didn't have

1289
01:32:00,869 --> 01:32:08,159
enough time but if we had more time and

1290
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:11,009
we will go on improving it then we will

1291
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:12,839
make it more Pro this is just to show

1292
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:15,329
some data will benefit from those eight

1293
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:17,579
seconds to thank the URI and the

1294
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:18,170
organizers of this event thank you very

1295
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:24,469
much

1296
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:24,470
[Applause]

1297
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:41,429
okay we have two more teams we are on

1298
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,429
schedule

1299
01:32:43,949 --> 01:32:53,428
the idea is to get ready before the

1300
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:59,920
presentation so we still have two teams

1301
01:32:53,429 --> 01:33:03,010
to go we are okay with time and take

1302
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:07,179
into account please take into account

1303
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:11,890
your own votes because you are focused

1304
01:33:07,179 --> 01:33:15,760
on your own presentation and then you

1305
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:19,960
forgot about the other team's names etc

1306
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:22,570
but then you are in the other location

1307
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:24,870
where we will continue working you might

1308
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:24,870
have a chance

1309
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:42,780
it was a good old multi like mr. okay

1310
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,780
it's a dish from a lot of little things

1311
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,920
applicants

1312
01:34:03,950 --> 01:34:07,099
[Music]

1313
01:34:37,130 --> 01:34:46,050
olá season hello

1314
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:48,360
I will speak not from the stage because

1315
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:50,520
I feel more comfy here this is the drone

1316
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,559
please do not suit it down because I

1317
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:56,040
love it

1318
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:58,070
our project is do th transport oriented

1319
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:05,700
to hyvää

1320
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:08,400
as you know here we had to give our best

1321
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:09,240
we are here to compete we haven't slept

1322
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:12,139
much

1323
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:15,420
we just had tons of coffee and that's

1324
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:20,490
the same for the rest is a killer for

1325
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:22,560
all of us in total it was two thousand

1326
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:25,679
eight hundred and eighty minutes to

1327
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:28,440
complete the budget we have created more

1328
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:31,890
than 1 million of code lines from

1329
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:34,980
scratch and we have completed 95% we

1330
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:37,890
haven't been able to attain 100% of the

1331
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:41,519
pre-plan project how did we started we

1332
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:44,730
came here from zero we didn't have

1333
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,580
anything not even a line of code we only

1334
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:51,089
had the idea and the draft as I said

1335
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:54,110
this was our starting point we wanted to

1336
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:59,850
be come here and start the procedure and

1337
01:35:54,110 --> 01:36:02,150
we are two and two make such a complex

1338
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:06,360
project he was quite a task

1339
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:10,290
he's been difficult but we are quite

1340
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:13,830
satisfied what we have created those

1341
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:19,890
that have created do th have been using

1342
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:23,370
different tools one of them is Cajun dot

1343
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:26,970
as H that generates public and private

1344
01:36:23,370 --> 01:36:30,780
keys and is in charge of encryption then

1345
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:35,160
create a s dot as H generates an access

1346
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:39,409
point for our clients so the drone will

1347
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:42,260
provide a nexus point

1348
01:36:39,409 --> 01:36:45,339
connection that Sh makes the connection

1349
01:36:42,260 --> 01:36:48,530
with the closest spot

1350
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:51,790
kameena that Sh is a script that

1351
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:55,570
simulates the use of a distance vector

1352
01:36:51,790 --> 01:37:02,330
that follows algorithmic bellman-ford

1353
01:36:55,570 --> 01:37:05,870
used in our AP we also have the tools

1354
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:08,870
inside the server there are different

1355
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:12,110
we've been trying different connections

1356
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:14,989
and different orders and we will do a

1357
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:19,280
demo with one of them so that you see

1358
01:37:14,989 --> 01:37:22,400
we've been trying all the application

1359
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:24,019
attempts and recommendations by the URLs

1360
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:27,199
that remember that we started from

1361
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:29,780
scratch all those tools and some more

1362
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:32,980
that I might forget been done from

1363
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:37,400
scratch in only two days what do we have

1364
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:40,428
this is our drone and remember that we

1365
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:45,320
have Elena Elena and the Jose Elena

1366
01:37:40,429 --> 01:37:49,520
wants to connect with Jose Elena here

1367
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:52,070
she's she connects to the drone to send

1368
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:53,870
the message send the message to the

1369
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:57,830
drone and the drone will send the

1370
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:58,099
message to Jose this is what we have so

1371
01:37:57,830 --> 01:38:00,980
far

1372
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:02,630
and you might say poor thing what about

1373
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:05,388
the rest of the drones we need more

1374
01:38:02,630 --> 01:38:07,730
drones yes the idea of this project was

1375
01:38:05,389 --> 01:38:09,940
to lunch around 10 drones so that they

1376
01:38:07,730 --> 01:38:12,769
could communicate among themselves

1377
01:38:09,940 --> 01:38:14,659
because we only had two days we haven't

1378
01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:16,400
been able to do we have planet so that

1379
01:38:14,659 --> 01:38:18,860
we can continue later on with the

1380
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:22,250
project and develop it with more drones

1381
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:27,170
but this demo only works now with one

1382
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:28,880
with two drones I imagine and then we

1383
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:32,060
had to reinvent the wheel since we

1384
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:36,340
started or working in hackathon will

1385
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:40,489
been given help about Network protocols

1386
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:42,920
we've been following all advice and

1387
01:38:40,489 --> 01:38:44,388
we've tried as much as possible then we

1388
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:46,699
realized something

1389
01:38:44,389 --> 01:38:49,599
what we said at the beginning our idea

1390
01:38:46,699 --> 01:38:53,178
is to bring the future into the present

1391
01:38:49,599 --> 01:38:55,280
for that we shouldn't use old

1392
01:38:53,179 --> 01:38:58,130
technologies but adapt them to our

1393
01:38:55,280 --> 01:39:00,530
project the problems we encountered were

1394
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:03,349
because we should have our fixed notes

1395
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:06,889
because we're going to use drones oral

1396
01:39:03,349 --> 01:39:09,320
notes will be moving we have to adapt

1397
01:39:06,889 --> 01:39:14,479
old technology and implement a protocol

1398
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:17,929
from zero was too complex that's why we

1399
01:39:14,479 --> 01:39:18,829
hadn't implemented communication among

1400
01:39:17,929 --> 01:39:23,599
the ten drones

1401
01:39:18,829 --> 01:39:25,969
well will the future be like 40 oth this

1402
01:39:23,599 --> 01:39:30,439
was just a starting point this project

1403
01:39:25,969 --> 01:39:34,329
is going to be the end project at

1404
01:39:30,439 --> 01:39:39,409
University we want to continue with just

1405
01:39:34,329 --> 01:39:42,880
pressing enters that drones take off and

1406
01:39:39,409 --> 01:39:45,379
communicate among themselves this is a

1407
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:48,829
communication system with nodes are

1408
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:51,439
difficult to sit down is not just we

1409
01:39:48,829 --> 01:39:56,630
have different nodes our idea is that

1410
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:59,539
you can have a secure communication you

1411
01:39:56,630 --> 01:40:01,729
launch the drone if somebody throws a

1412
01:39:59,539 --> 01:40:05,509
stone can't set it down but nobody can

1413
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:08,419
physically take it this is another

1414
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:11,179
difficulty and thank you especially I'd

1415
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:13,398
like to thank the members of the jury

1416
01:40:11,179 --> 01:40:15,949
for their ideas we've tried to implement

1417
01:40:13,399 --> 01:40:17,599
them all thank you to the hackathon and

1418
01:40:15,949 --> 01:40:20,209
the organizers for getting this event

1419
01:40:17,599 --> 01:40:22,669
and thank to our colleagues for the

1420
01:40:20,209 --> 01:40:27,438
support and encouragement throughout the

1421
01:40:22,669 --> 01:40:30,820
hackathon and now this is the demo we

1422
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:30,820
have our progress so far

1423
01:40:33,139 --> 01:40:40,340
if the URI can now use these two

1424
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:41,659
computers we're gonna leave one to each

1425
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:45,979
member of the URI

1426
01:40:41,659 --> 01:40:48,289
said yeah now the drone is the acer one

1427
01:40:45,979 --> 01:40:50,179
that would be simulating the drone so

1428
01:40:48,289 --> 01:40:52,969
one computer would be a leaner and the

1429
01:40:50,179 --> 01:40:55,820
other one hosting to just pick up the

1430
01:40:52,969 --> 01:40:56,880
one you like you can be Elena our

1431
01:40:55,820 --> 01:41:01,099
hostess

1432
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,100
to you buddy

1433
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:11,099
whatever HR submitted

1434
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:15,840
I'm gonna benefit when it is this time

1435
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:18,660
so that you can see we're gonna show you

1436
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:22,380
the starting point at the script and you

1437
01:41:18,660 --> 01:41:25,050
will see the communication what they

1438
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:27,210
would do before giving them their own

1439
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:32,790
computers is to go to the folder where

1440
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:38,370
our program is located here they es do

1441
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:41,460
th the name is director and we will be

1442
01:41:38,370 --> 01:41:46,080
in director and in order to do the

1443
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:50,340
setting and provide content we reduce

1444
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:55,050
the file country dot es that gives two

1445
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:57,570
options start or help they can be reused

1446
01:41:55,050 --> 01:42:00,260
by anybody we might execute start and

1447
01:41:57,570 --> 01:42:03,690
we'll give information about the notes

1448
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:06,390
because we want to have a strong as many

1449
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:10,559
drugs as possible he gives us the

1450
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:11,730
password tool for authentication so that

1451
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:15,690
messages can be sent

1452
01:42:11,730 --> 01:42:21,209
I believe I've created a folder when he

1453
01:42:15,690 --> 01:42:27,059
was already there I type information

1454
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:30,030
about the user and I execute again one

1455
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:33,860
note and everything is perfect so we

1456
01:42:30,030 --> 01:42:38,639
might have now the user folder with the

1457
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:43,469
information to the user only for team

1458
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:46,590
should we avoid intrusions folder notes

1459
01:42:43,469 --> 01:42:51,719
it will be the folder with this a

1460
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:55,190
specific node we might be in node one

1461
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:58,530
and we will create an access point

1462
01:42:55,190 --> 01:43:01,080
because he's already been created with

1463
01:42:58,530 --> 01:43:04,830
don't need to do it now but so that you

1464
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:08,010
can see the steps the access point is

1465
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:12,720
created and to set the server so that

1466
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:15,060
they can correct those are all the test

1467
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:15,900
applications each connects in a

1468
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:21,030
different way

1469
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:24,420
one sense everything in plain text

1470
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:28,679
although some others are cryptid now

1471
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:31,530
this is going to be a chat between both

1472
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:35,640
computers and we will feel the

1473
01:43:31,530 --> 01:43:41,420
conversation it was already loaded if

1474
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:46,800
you can see it note related to the index

1475
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:50,540
to load our server once it's loaded that

1476
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:54,810
is in port 3000 we will go to our local

1477
01:43:50,540 --> 01:44:01,530
host 3000 and this is what they could be

1478
01:43:54,810 --> 01:44:06,270
viewing but now it's empty but now if

1479
01:44:01,530 --> 01:44:11,059
Elena or people can send a message so

1480
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:11,060
that we can check by sending a message

1481
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:24,440
and Elena's got it Elena can you reply

1482
01:44:32,529 --> 01:44:38,329
communicative as you can see

1483
01:44:34,549 --> 01:44:41,089
communication works life he sends a

1484
01:44:38,329 --> 01:44:51,228
message the server receives it intently

1485
01:44:41,089 --> 01:44:54,229
directed to all users connected and this

1486
01:44:51,229 --> 01:44:57,519
is demo and the end of our time thank

1487
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:57,519
you very much for your attention

1488
01:44:57,850 --> 01:44:59,190
[Applause]

1489
01:44:58,630 --> 01:45:02,360
[Music]

1490
01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:02,360
[Applause]

1491
01:45:10,059 --> 01:45:21,049
hmmm a quick question

1492
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:24,739
the connection between Elena and cozy

1493
01:45:21,049 --> 01:45:27,919
and port 3000 is not using HTTPS for

1494
01:45:24,739 --> 01:45:30,799
reason is by sockets directly by sockets

1495
01:45:27,919 --> 01:45:35,449
if you send it the server receive it and

1496
01:45:30,799 --> 01:45:40,549
then send it to the recipient but would

1497
01:45:35,449 --> 01:45:43,188
use in normal sockets yes they were

1498
01:45:40,549 --> 01:45:45,919
different they must we have the exchange

1499
01:45:43,189 --> 01:45:48,559
of tables each folder if you want to

1500
01:45:45,919 --> 01:45:50,299
test it makes a connection in a

1501
01:45:48,559 --> 01:45:53,209
different ways there's a folder that

1502
01:45:50,299 --> 01:45:56,299
sense they change so that you can

1503
01:45:53,209 --> 01:45:58,959
connect when you have 10 drones and you

1504
01:45:56,299 --> 01:46:03,559
can say the connection we haven't been

1505
01:45:58,959 --> 01:46:07,209
successful yet but here it is so we can

1506
01:46:03,559 --> 01:46:07,209
develop it later thank you

1507
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:34,640
and the last but not least team

1508
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:48,719
hey Allah hello see ya

1509
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:03,180
[Music]

1510
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:55,280
remember that after this demo we will go

1511
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:59,200
to the hackathon area for the you're

1512
01:47:55,280 --> 01:48:02,410
voting so that you can rest a little bit

1513
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:02,410
until one

1514
01:48:28,050 --> 01:48:30,470
nice

1515
01:49:47,730 --> 01:49:54,070
male estimate Lister's okay we're ready

1516
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:56,739
don't look at the man that is working

1517
01:49:54,070 --> 01:50:03,179
behind the stage and this is quite a

1518
01:49:56,739 --> 01:50:03,178
complex for just one person

1519
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:12,140
okay as we said in the presentation

1520
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:26,010
r2 is a program to find wireless

1521
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:37,740
networks and devices and we're going to

1522
01:50:26,010 --> 01:50:42,600
show some real use cases about

1523
01:50:37,740 --> 01:50:47,550
development as we said we started from

1524
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:50,910
scratch the project are a super

1525
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:55,650
important Hardware one in relation to

1526
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:58,170
the code is not too long as our

1527
01:50:55,650 --> 01:51:01,530
colleague said code lines are very

1528
01:50:58,170 --> 01:51:02,070
expensive in time just to write a few

1529
01:51:01,530 --> 01:51:05,040
ones

1530
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:08,759
therefore server is divided in a core

1531
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:15,330
part in that is independent executing

1532
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:21,770
the different plugins and there was much

1533
01:51:15,330 --> 01:51:28,100
effort to do to find the right plugins

1534
01:51:21,770 --> 01:51:33,200
it's been held to until we found them

1535
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:36,410
and then the silver also has a viewer

1536
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:41,360
through web service and those web

1537
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:44,590
services can be used to view data we

1538
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:47,809
create a small panel and then the

1539
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:50,120
complementary part that is the Howard

1540
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:53,360
were hacking we had to struggle with

1541
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:58,160
many different devices in our three

1542
01:51:53,360 --> 01:52:00,710
heavy bags some we managed to make them

1543
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:02,200
work we haven't been successful in other

1544
01:52:00,710 --> 01:52:06,470
cases

1545
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:11,740
let us show different demos and we're

1546
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:11,740
now going to move to demo number one

1547
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:20,750
demos we're going to start by the lowest

1548
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:25,300
level or J's there are not so nice and

1549
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:29,630
then we will improve them as we go along

1550
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:34,460
here the idea was to detect an attack

1551
01:52:29,630 --> 01:52:37,760
with this gadget is BTS gsm that

1552
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:41,150
emulates a real one the plugin is

1553
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:44,780
implemented is in the repository but is

1554
01:52:41,150 --> 01:52:54,500
extremely slow so in just 10 minutes we

1555
01:52:44,780 --> 01:52:59,150
don't have time to show it live now we

1556
01:52:54,500 --> 01:53:03,680
have implemented a tool that scans gsm

1557
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:08,089
networks and the idea was to implement

1558
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:10,970
and control the power you can see

1559
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:12,640
different channels with frequency and

1560
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:17,830
power

1561
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:21,020
the idea is to compare it with the sign

1562
01:53:17,830 --> 01:53:25,690
broadcasted by this device that has to

1563
01:53:21,020 --> 01:53:31,250
be higher the problem is that this takes

1564
01:53:25,690 --> 01:53:33,889
15 to 20 minutes to go through the 900

1565
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:39,839
to 1,000 megahertz and we don't have

1566
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:45,269
time for this now if we now move to demo

1567
01:53:39,839 --> 01:53:50,369
number two what we've done is scanning

1568
01:53:45,269 --> 01:53:55,409
Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Bluetooth as

1569
01:53:50,369 --> 01:54:02,209
this bracelet with a small look if you

1570
01:53:55,409 --> 01:54:06,749
now show the control panel those are the

1571
01:54:02,209 --> 01:54:12,599
devices because there is a great deal of

1572
01:54:06,749 --> 01:54:15,478
noise is not so accurate but otherwise

1573
01:54:12,599 --> 01:54:18,079
it will detect more what is the

1574
01:54:15,479 --> 01:54:24,659
functionality of this plug-in for

1575
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:28,228
people's control residents if people

1576
01:54:24,659 --> 01:54:31,879
wear the bracelet we can see there's a

1577
01:54:28,229 --> 01:54:34,949
missing person or we can limit areas

1578
01:54:31,879 --> 01:54:39,149
where if there is an intrusion an alarm

1579
01:54:34,949 --> 01:54:42,388
might be activated there is a device

1580
01:54:39,149 --> 01:54:50,599
that is the name is a smart lock and is

1581
01:54:42,389 --> 01:54:55,919
this this one is a Bluetooth Locker

1582
01:54:50,599 --> 01:55:01,169
clock with an application if we remove

1583
01:54:55,919 --> 01:55:03,539
the batteries it will be switched off

1584
01:55:01,169 --> 01:55:05,849
and this goes on scanning and now the

1585
01:55:03,539 --> 01:55:14,989
smart lock should disappear from the

1586
01:55:05,849 --> 01:55:23,770
panel as you can see is just gone so now

1587
01:55:14,989 --> 01:55:35,740
we could activate an alert or whatever

1588
01:55:23,770 --> 01:55:38,530
now demo number three is similar to the

1589
01:55:35,740 --> 01:55:42,730
Bluetooth one but this is an inventory

1590
01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:46,330
of Wi-Fi networks we can have a white

1591
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:49,389
list that we want to monitor our ignore

1592
01:55:46,330 --> 01:55:53,769
those that we do not want the monitor we

1593
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:56,470
can't if there's a fall the service if

1594
01:55:53,770 --> 01:56:01,390
any of the notes no longer work we can

1595
01:55:56,470 --> 01:56:06,700
detect malicious network or networks

1596
01:56:01,390 --> 01:56:12,400
that are being used to filter data here

1597
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:14,889
you can see all Wi-Fi networks that are

1598
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:16,990
around this device cyber camp and some

1599
01:56:14,890 --> 01:56:20,590
others and as with the rest of the

1600
01:56:16,990 --> 01:56:24,730
screens it provides some data frequency

1601
01:56:20,590 --> 01:56:28,980
channel and power so we can have an idea

1602
01:56:24,730 --> 01:56:35,879
of how far or how close they are

1603
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:40,570
now the next the moment about the Wi-Fi

1604
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:47,640
with this gadget we have here the

1605
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:53,750
pineapple Ricardo can you show it yes

1606
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:57,600
is the pineapple Mar 5

1607
01:56:53,750 --> 01:57:06,030
for Wi-Fi network or it and it also

1608
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:11,220
allows attacks if the problem 30 attacks

1609
01:57:06,030 --> 01:57:14,960
by default although you can add more one

1610
01:57:11,220 --> 01:57:18,360
of the attacks karma captures the proves

1611
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:22,560
that the deliverance lunch to connect

1612
01:57:18,360 --> 01:57:25,469
the Wi-Fi networks known Wi-Fi networks

1613
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:31,050
and this device that takes those probes

1614
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:34,470
and emulates the Wi-Fi to DC to you so

1615
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:37,770
that you connect to it we have designed

1616
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:40,290
a plugin that detects this type of

1617
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:42,570
attack but you can see it's in green

1618
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:46,040
because right now it's not the attack is

1619
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:48,660
not in progress but this is the

1620
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:51,150
pineapple interface with all the

1621
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:56,820
potential attacks and here you see the

1622
01:57:51,150 --> 01:58:00,889
karma one that when you press the

1623
01:57:56,820 --> 01:58:00,889
execute is on

1624
01:58:17,929 --> 01:58:28,949
now the attack is not launched yet the

1625
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:33,539
pineapples the same somewhat problematic

1626
01:58:28,949 --> 01:58:39,469
you've seen the list with 40 or 50 Wi-Fi

1627
01:58:33,539 --> 01:58:39,469
networks available now it's working

1628
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:57,830
from Venus order vamos a posar it works

1629
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:00,920
I'm sure it does let's move on to the

1630
01:58:57,830 --> 01:59:04,610
next demo basically would launch the

1631
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:08,990
attack that would be then detected and

1632
01:59:04,610 --> 01:59:17,690
so it would turn red let's move on to

1633
01:59:08,990 --> 01:59:24,200
the next demo you can execute our F map

1634
01:59:17,690 --> 01:59:27,259
directly and hint via Marsh so we're

1635
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:32,690
going to be super fast what you're

1636
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:36,160
seeing here is a real scenario well

1637
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:39,080
let's imagine a real industrial 4 dot L

1638
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:42,110
environment with age a piece of

1639
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:48,769
equipment connected by monitoring

1640
01:59:42,110 --> 01:59:50,900
sensors and there are eight links ok so

1641
01:59:48,770 --> 01:59:53,330
for example I'm going to simulate that

1642
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:58,639
one of the links crashes for example

1643
01:59:53,330 --> 02:00:01,870
number six I'm going to say hit signal

1644
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:01,870
number six from here

1645
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:29,100
another demon unfortunately

1646
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:59,330
what's a team artifact oh my goodness

1647
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:13,650
I'll explain it to you I would be able

1648
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:17,490
to interact with each of the eight

1649
02:01:13,650 --> 02:01:20,519
channels it would flash in red and this

1650
02:01:17,490 --> 02:01:23,179
will help us monitor that these a links

1651
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:26,460
to the image he said working in in one

1652
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:33,390
fascist we will know that now it's

1653
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:35,850
working yes number six this could be

1654
02:01:33,390 --> 02:01:40,320
used for example to analyze a spectrum

1655
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:42,630
and look for gaps et Aradia are number

1656
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:48,990
six and I tell you change this to number

1657
02:01:42,630 --> 02:01:53,780
two for example now it detects number

1658
02:01:48,990 --> 02:01:57,349
two and this of course has many

1659
02:01:53,780 --> 02:02:00,330
applications to look for things that are

1660
02:01:57,350 --> 02:02:14,540
pushing and thanks very much

1661
02:02:00,330 --> 02:02:19,680
sorry for the delay I have a question

1662
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:24,210
regarding GSM it's true that to do local

1663
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:30,420
mapping it takes time the gsm plugging

1664
02:02:24,210 --> 02:02:34,320
once it's big mapping for 20 minutes is

1665
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:39,390
there does it identify new ones

1666
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:43,950
oh no we did the plugging of the core

1667
02:02:39,390 --> 02:02:48,090
that collects all data we don't have

1668
02:02:43,950 --> 02:02:51,030
discovered that's where we would program

1669
02:02:48,090 --> 02:02:52,499
an alert to to take a new one with an

1670
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:56,249
extra different

1671
02:02:52,499 --> 02:02:58,920
staying power but that's part of the

1672
02:02:56,249 --> 02:03:00,690
front and we haven't done this because

1673
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:04,070
we didn't have time

1674
02:03:00,690 --> 02:03:06,900
the others will prepare we're prepared

1675
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:10,679
we're aware of the difficulties but the

1676
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:13,799
core is done that core is done yes it

1677
02:03:10,679 --> 02:03:16,499
draws a list and you can see it in text

1678
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:20,630
format but you obtained the list of all

1679
02:03:16,499 --> 02:03:23,840
VTS and the power associated power

1680
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:23,840
thank you

1681
02:03:32,910 --> 02:03:34,970
you
