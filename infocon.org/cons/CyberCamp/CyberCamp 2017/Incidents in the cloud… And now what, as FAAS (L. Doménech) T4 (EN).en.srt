1
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,840
better faith the Lord oh hey we want the

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,119
earth thank you good morning we're going

3
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,229
to start this workshop I hope you enjoy

4
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,300
it I know it's very early so I'm going

5
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,519
to try to wake you up with something

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:41,890
that's interesting I don't know if you

7
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:44,829
know about the cloud world there's cyber

8
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,720
response for we've got some forensics

9
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:49,720
here you can do all sorts of things

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,010
you're gonna like this because it's

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:57,100
called incidence in the cloud or fast

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:03,789
which is a term that was coined many

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:06,509
years ago forensic service and we're

14
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:09,490
gonna look at the whole process and and

15
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:14,860
look at it from a technical viewpoint I

16
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:18,929
hope you enjoy it I should like to thank

17
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:21,640
in theory for inviting me here this is

18
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:25,149
what I do this is a little bit about me

19
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,810
I work in process a war and I'm in

20
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:33,970
charge of the digital forensics service

21
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:38,440
there is my education the certification

22
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:42,280
that I've got and what I do outside my

23
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:47,020
job I'm a lecturer I'm a cyber volunteer

24
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:51,270
for the NCBI enema speak speaker and on

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,270
the bottom you can see how I'm

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,619
it was when I was younger let's start

27
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,929
with the table of contents we're gonna

28
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,210
mix things we're going to talk about the

29
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,310
general concepts today but they're going

30
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:16,640
to be all mixed up fast which is a

31
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,640
service offered to different companies

32
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:24,530
who offers services to other customers

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:28,020
in the cloud we're talking about

34
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:30,300
forensic issues and you have to have the

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,819
appropriate team for everything that you

36
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,569
need to do in the cloud and I'll explain

37
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:38,720
that a little bit later I also need to

38
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:43,500
make a disclaimer because every time

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:47,250
we're going to do concept trials or some

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,769
kind of an ethical hack we have to tell

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,470
people here we're going to talk about

42
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:57,510
three a provider so the most of the

43
00:02:52,470 --> 00:03:00,420
important Google as you from Microsoft

44
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:04,620
and Amazon web server please are there

45
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:10,470
three main ones and we're going to be

46
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:13,350
concentrating on them in my talk I'm

47
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,019
gonna be having them it'll be a basic

48
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,079
average medium level talk for anybody

49
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:28,049
that's in this room I think you'll find

50
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:29,670
it useful so an introduction let's look

51
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:35,820
at the whole of the model from the left

52
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:41,040
to the right on premises is they've

53
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:44,160
water forensic offers typically you've

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:49,410
got all the machines that you manage and

55
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:54,090
in this kind of model you can have SAS

56
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:57,390
and pass an es so you free up control of

57
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,140
hardware so you can have a forensic but

58
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,100
there are other conditioning the factors

59
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,828
they can see the different controls that

60
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,840
you have to have what you manage and

61
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,950
what your main supplier manages and this

62
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:18,600
is very important

63
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:24,219
I like this slide because it shows how

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:29,490
systems used to operate before 2005 in

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:34,450
IOT networks everything was centralized

66
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:37,630
how it looks today where things can be

67
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:40,960
controlled from the cloud and there you

68
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:44,530
offer different services and what we

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,349
expect to happen from 2025 and beyond

70
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,700
this is very interesting because

71
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,729
everything is going to be decentralized

72
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,320
it's going to be distributed there'll be

73
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:55,359
a communication between all the

74
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,620
different devices and the cloud and it

75
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,560
all be automated and it supposedly is

76
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,750
going to be distributed via blockchain I

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:11,680
think as very ambitious and also very

78
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:14,350
interesting and that's why it's

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,830
necessary to have this kind of services

80
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,600
like out of us because you need to have

81
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,760
some kind of control if an incident

82
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:28,680
happens you need to have sufficient

83
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:31,520
skills to know what has happened let's

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:39,830
get to the point

85
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:42,258
I remember at a talk once at a Microsoft

86
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,389
at all somebody said oh there was no

87
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,479
doubt about the level of safety in the

88
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:49,159
cloud I thought well hang on a minute

89
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,159
maybe that's not true because at the end

90
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:54,440
of the day the cloud is managed by

91
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:56,120
people we all make mistakes and at an

92
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,960
infrastructure therefore there are

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:02,539
mistakes every day that errors are free

94
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,210
day I a couple of years ago started

95
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:09,318
looking into the cloud issue with

96
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,880
different suppliers and I looked into

97
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:17,509
security and of course it's not a

98
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:20,090
hundred percent safe so let's see what

99
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:21,590
we can do and what sort of forensic

100
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:26,090
services we can offer there are many

101
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:29,299
incidents that can ruin a small company

102
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,340
or about large company we've seen news

103
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,120
about Playstations

104
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,460
I think it was a few months ago how that

105
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:44,599
was harmed and that could happen in our

106
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:48,680
company so let's imagine you've got an

107
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,719
instance you're most your computers

108
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,900
aren't well maintained they've not been

109
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:55,610
updated they've got a bad setup and

110
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,349
you're exposed to internet this is a

111
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:02,090
typical example of what happened and you

112
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:06,770
you of course that can be very

113
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:11,020
vulnerable you might have bad

114
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:15,549
developments and bad implementation and

115
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:20,240
there may be an error we're all human

116
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:23,569
so people may upload something like a

117
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,520
kowler into the cloud and our service

118
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:29,949
provider then cuts that service to us

119
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,469
and that's just because of bad

120
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:35,000
implementation this is gonna have an

121
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:39,139
effect of course on the company

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,310
there's also malpractice of users if

123
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,870
your users aren't properly trained they

124
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:49,700
may accidentally let

125
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,740
we're in and then passwords may be very

126
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,340
very exposed it's far more than people

127
00:07:51,740 --> 00:08:02,480
think because you've got a developers

128
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:04,460
that are using the cloud they could hack

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,980
into passwords or access code so you

130
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,180
need to be very careful with this

131
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:12,590
because there are people specifically

132
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:18,290
who try to do that so we need to be very

133
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:21,049
careful and then a combined attack and

134
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:23,270
that that is using the cloud to attack a

135
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,580
third party we've seen that as well that

136
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,799
can happen we saw it in PlayStation and

137
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:34,010
in more cases but people try to cover

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:36,080
that up but it actually does happen ok

139
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,189
what sort of challenges when we do we

140
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,500
face when we offer this kind of service

141
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,520
firstly we need to have a good

142
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:45,460
relationship with our supplier our

143
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,329
customer and ongoing communication

144
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:56,060
that's going to make everything a lot

145
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:58,130
easier we need to be very agile when

146
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,160
asking for control over all the elements

147
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:05,600
that are in the cloud and to be able to

148
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:07,160
work we of course need permits then you

149
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
gotta have the permits when the incident

150
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,270
happens you need them before what about

151
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,100
and the characteristics as well because

152
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,210
everybody has different concepts you can

153
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:24,830
see you can make a simile for example

154
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:27,470
between Amazon and Google and they

155
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,680
develop characteristics that may be

156
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,300
similar but actually technically have a

157
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,189
small differences and you need to know

158
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,630
all the different characteristics what

159
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,930
some of the security levels they have so

160
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:41,120
we need to be very much up to date of

161
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,500
all changes and everything that's

162
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,110
progressing because that can help us

163
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,510
also Lee legally the jurisdiction it's

164
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,750
very important to know what you can do

165
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,760
and what you can't to do you may have

166
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:56,179
your data center in one place you're

167
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:59,939
suffering in another place

168
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,439
so you really need to carry out yourself

169
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:04,679
because I'm kind of auditor for what you

170
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:10,519
can Jim what you can't and you need to

171
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:14,569
be honest if you end up going to court

172
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:19,589
you need to be very careful with your

173
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:28,979
integrity and how you look after the the

174
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:31,079
chain a forensics service you need to

175
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,970
have things that are traceable as well

176
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:40,349
but here normally you're just

177
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:42,480
firefighting so you need to always for

178
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,519
example record on video all the

179
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,329
different processes so that if something

180
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,980
goes wrong and we have to go to court we

181
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:56,279
need to be able to provide evidence of

182
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:58,829
what we've been doing preparation how do

183
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:02,249
you get ready for this I think there are

184
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:04,319
two service models new one which is of

185
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:06,540
being a firefighter if something's

186
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,799
happened nobody knows what's going on

187
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,238
you're cold and you have to go and put

188
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,239
the fire out that's what a firefighter

189
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:14,309
does that's the situation that I really

190
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:16,829
don't like I prefer to have everything

191
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:19,230
prepared I prefer to be monitoring

192
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:27,388
everything but sometimes you have to go

193
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:30,089
and put out a fire and that's is costly

194
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:32,459
and requires time especially if you go

195
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,769
to place where you have no idea of the

196
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:37,349
architecture you need to very rapid

197
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:39,179
response you need a rapid response team

198
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:43,589
and you really need to know what you're

199
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:46,259
doing keep your keep of cool heads know

200
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:47,789
what to do where to stop they're

201
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,879
critical decisions that you're taking

202
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:53,749
are critical tip moments in time and so

203
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,919
it's very important to know about

204
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:57,480
architecture I've already spoken about

205
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,269
legal side of things and that's also

206
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,489
important so if you're being a

207
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:05,639
firefighter of course you need to be

208
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:07,960
able to contact with a delegate to say

209
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,130
okay we've got services and so

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,650
for all countries that we're gonna offer

211
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,620
bitching which includes of course

212
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:20,890
monitoring service than which you've

213
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:23,110
you've got everything agreed upon with a

214
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:27,520
current a series of service level

215
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:33,580
agreements so you got to go to the

216
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:40,270
critical points what are we forensics

217
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:42,520
really like we like logins we like

218
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,590
system administrator so do we need to

219
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,850
try to create everything that we want as

220
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:52,620
if it was like a a funnel going into a

221
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,120
machine so that you can get everything

222
00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:00,790
possible and create everything that you

223
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,680
need and also the relationship with

224
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:09,510
other endpoints this is of course

225
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:13,000
important if we've got a cyber security

226
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:15,550
incident and the patient as it were is

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,610
ill we need to isolate that's a case and

228
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:23,530
and see what it effects so we're going

229
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:30,090
to need a profile an auditors profile

230
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:38,800
and the necessary permits to work as a

231
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:46,150
forensics and in the end we need a

232
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:48,819
series of resources which we can have in

233
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:52,840
the customers premises or in app on our

234
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:54,340
premises because you can be offering a

235
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,250
forensic service to their cloud directly

236
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,200
or you could actually go to their cloud

237
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:04,150
and bring them down everything that they

238
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:08,760
have that takes a little longer and here

239
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:12,959
you can see how the service is set up

240
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,960
it's a very simple diagram

241
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,830
if there's an incident you have to sit

242
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:24,160
down with the customer write down the

243
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,870
basic data it's very important to have a

244
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,209
contact person you need to know if

245
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,980
something happens who you got to ring

246
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,710
who's got the password so who knows

247
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,890
about this because this is a continuous

248
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,660
ongoing service that you need to be able

249
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:44,620
to offer 24 hours a day you need to know

250
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:47,290
about the infrastructure you need to sit

251
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,100
down sometimes with the a client for a

252
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,780
week and to see what they've got and

253
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,970
compare what with what the client says

254
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:57,790
with what you can see so and that always

255
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,190
needs to be kept connected and kept up

256
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:04,199
to date so there's data collection there

257
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:07,000
and then we wait until something happens

258
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,560
it may well be that the customer calls

259
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,990
us or we realize that something's

260
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,209
happened but these are the three things

261
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,160
that you do you need to detect isolate

262
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:18,390
and contain this is really really

263
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,790
important when an incident happens

264
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,760
that's what we offer our customers first

265
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,920
of all you know something has happened

266
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,110
you isolate that incident and you

267
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,620
contain it so that the service can get

268
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,620
back to normality

269
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:39,070
then we annales analyze anything and if

270
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:43,900
there's any discordance between the date

271
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:45,910
the original data that we collected we

272
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,510
see oh you know you didn't say that this

273
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,949
was this had been updated so the end of

274
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:58,210
the day you what you're offering is a

275
00:15:50,950 --> 00:16:00,960
continuous improvement service now let's

276
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,960
look at a demo

277
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:10,800
concepts are very important before we

278
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,630
start looking at a demo and depending

279
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,569
upon the customer and then for structure

280
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:21,150
the customer has you can do some things

281
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:22,590
and others not we we can have some logs

282
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,720
and others not depending upon the

283
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,880
supplier so decisions need to be taken

284
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,830
and they're always a UPS upsides and

285
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,160
downsides to everything that we do so

286
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:39,810
let's make a machine for somebody it's

287
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:42,990
just started out in this world and we

288
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:45,510
can have a in this case a sift virtual

289
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:49,440
machine or a sans it's easy to set up

290
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:52,130
we'll do it in its recent most recent

291
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,420
version which was updated yesterday and

292
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:58,100
then we'll put it live and then we'll

293
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:01,589
see how if at a given moment in time a

294
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:07,949
person a client has an incident they

295
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:10,470
call us and we set up a lab in the cloud

296
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:13,890
and then what we'll do is get the

297
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,630
evidence and then connect the two you

298
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:21,360
can the good thing about the cloud as

299
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:26,270
you can do things remotely and then

300
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,270
we'll see and another couple of demos

301
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:34,440
which will be at our for forensic site

302
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:37,020
we'll get all the data we'll get

303
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,260
evidence capturing with all the

304
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,340
guarantees and then we'll work on that

305
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,450
okay those are the demos that we're

306
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:48,750
going to see this is the first one we're

307
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:51,240
creating the instance here I don't know

308
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:55,800
if you can see we're creating it from

309
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,750
zero in this demo by the way we've done

310
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,300
this all free of charge

311
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:05,130
with the instructions that you're given

312
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:07,409
you're given a series of credits to do

313
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,880
it free of charge and why do we do that

314
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,690
because we want people to see how

315
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,690
important it is

316
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,850
of course your machine normally won't be

317
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:20,990
sufficient you want more processing

318
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:22,879
power and the machine that we have here

319
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:30,940
is quite basic so what we're going to do

320
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:36,590
of all of the option that here this one

321
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:40,389
well choose the free option it's got a

322
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:43,580
Giga of RAM memory

323
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:51,918
there's a whole suite of things that you

324
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:56,059
can choose from up to 16 RAM so of

325
00:18:51,919 --> 00:19:00,590
course it depends on the needs so let's

326
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:07,190
move on now of all the different options

327
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:10,418
that are there which isn't this one here

328
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,740
we can customize this a little bit

329
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:15,350
here's everything that you've got to

330
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,519
choose by the way every each one of

331
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:23,570
these elements has a cost attached to it

332
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:26,299
we choose this one depending upon the

333
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:31,010
geographical area where we happen to be

334
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:33,250
located we'll leave this just on default

335
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,250
mode

336
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:41,659
this is the network you can also

337
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,000
customize a series of details but for

338
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,000
the moment let's just leave it as it is

339
00:19:51,820 --> 00:20:01,250
there's the machines capacity we've got

340
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:06,560
up to 30 so we're just right here 28 the

341
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:10,490
type of drive that you we can let's have

342
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,080
at the SSD it's not encrypted and off we

343
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,820
go

344
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,600
here you can see a series of tags this

345
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:20,300
is just to get organized we've got

346
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:34,909
several machines we need to identify

347
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:37,340
them let's go to create and here we can

348
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,900
set up a security group there are all

349
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,899
different security groups that you can

350
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,090
choose from we've already set one up but

351
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,070
I wanted you to see it here you can see

352
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,990
we've set one up and so let's choose

353
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:54,830
this one it's a very basic one

354
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:57,560
it says H RDP there you go we've

355
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:01,010
customized it this is the one and we

356
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:04,760
launch it there's not much now to do to

357
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,960
finish the process and there you've got

358
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,350
everything that we've selected you can

359
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,350
see it all

360
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:24,889
here we choose equipment what we want to

361
00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:27,220
do is to create a virtual machine so

362
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:34,789
what we're gonna do is give it

363
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:38,120
forensic functionality there we are it's

364
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:43,309
been created the machine now takes a

365
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:45,080
while I would just say that we shortened

366
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:51,350
the whole process just so that you can

367
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:57,100
see it there's our public IP let's

368
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:57,100
connect let's connect and now customize

369
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:07,899
this takes a while this process it's so

370
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:15,769
there you can see the machines tag

371
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:22,340
unlike others this account I've actually

372
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:23,809
created specifically for this where in

373
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,949
the description part you can see

374
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:30,350
everything that you have you can see

375
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:35,080
what the CPU have the CPU is and

376
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:41,269
everything else that you can see as well

377
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:46,899
how it's updated sometimes it takes a

378
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:49,130
while to update then we can see the

379
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:54,260
region which is always very important as

380
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:59,640
well and there's the code you can see it

381
00:22:54,260 --> 00:23:01,710
or I'm gonna stop it there

382
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,150
what we're going to do is to set up the

383
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,150
environment now with a series of

384
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:23,100
commands the best thing is Tabak

385
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:26,310
visually we can see real-time reports

386
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:29,490
timelines so that's the mode we're going

387
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:31,010
to ask for it so that it's we ask for it

388
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:36,720
to be an RDP

389
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:39,900
with a basic normal desktop and you open

390
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:45,330
it and secondly what we're going to do

391
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:48,120
is now is install it there's a series of

392
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:51,560
commands we're gonna go step by step it

393
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:56,879
takes a while but it's an easy process

394
00:23:51,560 --> 00:24:05,220
here you can see on the last line but

395
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:06,930
one we've got version 41.1 of 2017 there

396
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,640
are more update ones that but this one

397
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:12,420
is fine for the moment because the

398
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,760
others have been a problematic so it's a

399
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:23,510
basic machine that's just a basic

400
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:23,510
computer it's got a core that's carry on

401
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:31,220
with all this information and I'll put

402
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,220
it in my github

403
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,330
there you can see it user and password

404
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:13,290
then we've created the instance and what

405
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:17,679
we're going to do for the forensic work

406
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:20,680
now we've got the Machine what we want

407
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,320
to do is to mmm put all the evidence is

408
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:28,630
there so we're going to create a disk

409
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:31,560
and we'll match it so we can see what

410
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:45,400
we've got now this is the incident and

411
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:47,290
you can see their machine I've got my

412
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:54,120
profile here it's not the best profile

413
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:54,120
but us it's only a demo let's move on

414
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:17,389
this is what we saw earlier the same as

415
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:20,120
we saw via SSH and now let's look at

416
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:24,500
volumes there's a snapshot of the

417
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,149
machine what it's looking like you can

418
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,920
have people working on these different

419
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:33,110
snapshots so we've got our hard drive

420
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:39,950
we've asked it to investigate what's

421
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:47,590
going on there we can see what's going

422
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:47,590
on we've got the authority and then

423
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:58,289
we wait it takes a while and we'll have

424
00:26:56,369 --> 00:27:01,529
it in our machine we carry on it's it's

425
00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:03,499
located in our machine so we then move

426
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:07,259
on and work with it so it's easy really

427
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:10,919
our machine our forensic machine in the

428
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:12,749
car out with our evidences and we can

429
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,899
work it with it as if we were just a

430
00:27:12,749 --> 00:27:18,779
normal forensic that's as far as we're

431
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:21,809
going with that demo okay let's now do

432
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:24,929
another kind of a demo we've got a

433
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:27,779
machine in the cloud an Amazon machine

434
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:33,059
in the cloud let's now do a demo of a

435
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:36,779
case that we did with a machine in this

436
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:41,789
case it's an azure that we're using and

437
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:43,859
we've got an it's a machine for a

438
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:47,369
business environment so we were called

439
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:49,259
and they said we've got some very

440
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:52,978
suspicious logins and it looks like

441
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:56,580
there's been some kind of intrusion so

442
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:59,639
we have to somehow access it and see the

443
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,749
characteristics of the machine and then

444
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:06,629
how we can extract from the RAM memory

445
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:12,869
and look at a series of artifacts which

446
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:22,129
are key files that will give us an idea

447
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:28,969
of what's happening in the end

448
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:39,110
what we're going to do is have as hard

449
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:41,780
it is to it with a series of tools this

450
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:46,219
is the instance that we have this is our

451
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:47,600
virtual machine this is what the you

452
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,820
know what the diagram the setup looks

453
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,480
like it's very very basic seriously

454
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:58,909
basic we've got a subnet and an

455
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,490
interface public IP at the bottom you

456
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:04,270
can see the security group and the

457
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,270
virtual machine it's easy

458
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:19,280
that's our environment we can see it's

459
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:23,110
at the bottom it's there's a server it's

460
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:26,180
got the firewalls on it's fairly updated

461
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:33,080
it would seem that everything by default

462
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:38,330
is okay here I'm going to see if I can

463
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:40,340
stop this so what we do is okay once

464
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:43,490
again we've got this machine with its

465
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:46,399
hard drive and another series of hard

466
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,560
drives what we do is we put ours there

467
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,800
with our tools we'll talk about the

468
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,929
tools a little bit more in detail and

469
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,770
what we're going to do is work on the

470
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:59,540
information in that a hard drive what we

471
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:04,700
do isolate the information then we take

472
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:09,530
it to our machine and this is what we're

473
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:12,500
going to use here for those of you that

474
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:14,149
work on Incident Response and forensics

475
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:18,200
this is what we're doing is a live

476
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:21,500
response collection what it is it's a

477
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:23,420
link I don't like it for Mac and Linux

478
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,930
but it's good for Windows because it's

479
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:29,240
got a Suzy of tools different versions

480
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:32,610
they're free

481
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,299
and what it can do is it can edit you

482
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,399
can edit them

483
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:38,460
it's got scripts that you can edit as

484
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,169
you want them and that's what I'm

485
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,820
interested in because each case might

486
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:47,960
may be different so you have to extract

487
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:51,928
them as you want them with this tool you

488
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:58,740
can do it with the artifacts with RAM

489
00:30:51,929 --> 00:31:02,510
memory and with disks so we got the RAM

490
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,510
artifacts and off we go

491
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:11,730
male voice Jameson Ptolemaic so we get

492
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,919
into the Machine the unit unit has been

493
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:17,940
configured we have allocated a letter

494
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:29,130
and it's there we identify it as new

495
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:31,740
volume unit e here in this file we have

496
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:37,940
the skips with all the skips there we

497
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,940
have configured the tools and

498
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:45,210
directories there's two files like the

499
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:50,010
same you can get system data and this

500
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:53,909
nomenclature when will execute again the

501
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:56,309
back it will require another file and

502
00:31:53,909 --> 00:32:00,030
then we will dump it there the whole of

503
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:02,870
the content will execute executive

504
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:07,440
action and it starts with RAM memory

505
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:10,789
which is quite long ish yeah we get into

506
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,789
the file and we see how it is generated

507
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:17,970
first we have the memory my memory is

508
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:20,669
there and the image disks we can't do

509
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:29,210
anything against that and here the

510
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:31,919
process 5% 28 it takes time according

511
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:38,640
depending on your memory the processing

512
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:45,070
power let's see all the tools

513
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:48,610
32 and 64 versions for each one a series

514
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:55,629
of tools and here we are using this one

515
00:32:48,610 --> 00:33:02,290
run capture it's very basic for

516
00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:05,050
forensics and this file we have all the

517
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:08,590
information now it's being generated

518
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:11,590
this is not a good practice while you do

519
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:16,179
the extraction it's generating the the

520
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,689
files up but this is a demo so in it's

521
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,650
okay

522
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:25,960
the processes continue the back it each

523
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:28,030
one of the files is being fed these are

524
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,650
the logs and the records that we're

525
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:37,810
going to see in our lab we have last

526
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:41,790
activity view we will show the last

527
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,790
processes that were made in this machine

528
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:50,260
it's Excel format almost its HTML format

529
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:57,250
but you can convert it into Excel format

530
00:33:50,260 --> 00:34:03,310
so here we will analyze this data in

531
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:06,240
detail but this is a preview let's

532
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:06,240
continue with the process

533
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:16,489
it continues to generate files giving a

534
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:21,220
lot of content notes to it

535
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:23,418
the message is okay be patient it says

536
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:38,540
it's quite long a long process

537
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:41,330
especially with big machines let's

538
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:44,060
continue with other finds with all the

539
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:47,060
information that's being generated here

540
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,549
there were errors when you have to

541
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,129
analyze why what are the records that

542
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,869
haven't been generated there let's do

543
00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:57,410
the extraction maybe later and we don't

544
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:59,960
need to go back we need to analyze each

545
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:05,240
error we'll have a log with all the

546
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:09,440
processing processing processing options

547
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:12,220
and we will see what has happened here

548
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,980
the the other files that are important

549
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:19,970
in the records will have a lot of

550
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:23,680
information and we'll have to analyze it

551
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:27,919
in detail there are many tools that

552
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,660
everything that include all the detailed

553
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:39,369
information we have to see if it's

554
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:44,680
complete or not hosts information more

555
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:44,680
information in the network the Seaport

556
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:52,380
the client sends a series of logs and

557
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,750
this machine is published in the

558
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,490
internet so at the level of connection

559
00:35:54,750 --> 00:36:05,130
it's very important to see all the

560
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:08,339
events that happened let's browse the

561
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:11,580
finds the auto run the auto runs are

562
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,440
important too when there's an attack and

563
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:19,100
you want to have persistence it's very

564
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,100
common to go to that auto run section

565
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,880
this is the end and let's see the whole

566
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,700
process there's a detail of all the

567
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,770
processes that has been followed file

568
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:38,629
creation for good integrity we see what

569
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:44,480
we've done so we have the forensics hat

570
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:48,510
we've supervised what's happened the the

571
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,400
hashes of all that is obtained is saved

572
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:53,460
with Sears we'll have a series of

573
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:58,290
important hashes and then we'll have to

574
00:36:53,460 --> 00:37:02,430
go to trial we need to explain this this

575
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:04,410
is the content it's traceable the

576
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:09,240
versions the programs that have been

577
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:12,170
used the licenses of the tool and

578
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,169
everything is locked

579
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:26,779
Hey yes is in tonight ASIS and we are

580
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:26,779
near the end wait until it's completed

581
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:43,790
so this is the impression of the file

582
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:50,150
and we stop here once we're doing this

583
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:53,140
option we can use other it's not they're

584
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:55,850
not investigative applications that just

585
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:59,420
environments for for investigation if

586
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:02,960
we're a team we can do it together in

587
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:04,760
parallel here we have windows power

588
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,970
windows power cell we connect to the

589
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:11,660
clip CLA CLA and we can do certain

590
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:15,259
things at the same time if we know that

591
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:17,960
as an incident at the same time we do

592
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:21,080
the acquisition of the incidents we can

593
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:26,060
create an investigative environment and

594
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:28,100
we see locks appearing and we'll see

595
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:32,869
what we do with that we need to have the

596
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:35,210
clients authorization it's important to

597
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:38,540
ask for authorization we have this

598
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:45,260
option we can do a lot with this it's

599
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:49,250
very powerful and we have others that is

600
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:51,950
this is offered by Azur it has to be

601
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:55,160
configured upstream you can't just do it

602
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:58,430
there at any time has to be working

603
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:02,180
before as your analytics will do it on

604
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:06,490
the left you can see it a series of

605
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:09,410
consultations that we can that are

606
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:13,790
pre-configured and this is adapted to

607
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:16,250
fly into this instance here it's in

608
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,910
Spanish you pick the consultation you

609
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:22,010
edit it ideally it's being

610
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:24,259
pre-configured for your client you have

611
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:26,780
already your instances and then you only

612
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,280
need to execute and it gives you all the

613
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,960
information and the extraction is done

614
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,359
at the same time we can do several

615
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:38,200
things we'll have a team and we'll even

616
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:38,200
have a team much better let's continue

617
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:50,339
we've done the extraction we've got the

618
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:53,279
compressed file and we brought it to the

619
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:56,339
investigative forensics environment its

620
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:01,680
provider it has its own features in

621
00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:06,599
Azure we have a Windows server has its

622
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,640
own file and so in our report we need to

623
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:13,819
clarify that it has its own

624
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:17,879
characteristics and specificities so let

625
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:24,000
in the analysis that we've done we'll

626
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:26,760
have the seaport this is just about

627
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,589
investigating inquiring have a lot of

628
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,890
blogs and at the end we can't find an

629
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:34,619
application the one that you've seen

630
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,720
there at the bottom there's something

631
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:39,900
that's strange let's do an investigation

632
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:47,549
but this is quite striking what what

633
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:51,720
about this application what are the

634
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:57,210
programmed tasks maybe the program is

635
00:40:51,720 --> 00:41:00,049
there it's embedded this is not in Azure

636
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:02,760
byte effect so this is strange

637
00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:04,559
and then we see other things and the

638
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,530
last activity views and there is

639
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:12,630
something that is not in the right place

640
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:15,240
so we can have leads and it's a whole

641
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:17,960
investigation and it gathers a lot of

642
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,959
information

643
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:33,680
we are getting to the end of this part

644
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:39,589
here we have a information available and

645
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:41,330
then we can inform about this event so

646
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:44,720
you have this information you have no

647
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:47,299
clue so you have to mine the process and

648
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,680
go back to the initial process you need

649
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:56,599
to have a vision and investigate what

650
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:59,509
this process does this application is a

651
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:01,790
malware according to several certain

652
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:05,300
people but if you go to the source code

653
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:07,900
code and to the github will realize it

654
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:11,380
to control and administration in Windows

655
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:14,450
so there's a link where you see the tool

656
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:17,510
how it is created how it's compiled and

657
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:23,118
how you can adapt it to your needs

658
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:27,430
with a lots of options that was in the

659
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,990
machine that was the incident so we

660
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:32,089
analyzed it because we have a ram memory

661
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:35,029
we didn't see anything we've seen the

662
00:42:32,089 --> 00:42:40,279
artifacts we have the RAM memory that is

663
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:44,960
key in this case so we use volatility we

664
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:47,599
do an analysis this is just a summary so

665
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,140
we have the profile half of the ram

666
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,930
memory that we've taken this instance

667
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,509
that was connected to a specific port

668
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:58,759
through specific IP there was an

669
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:06,530
established connection and it was

670
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:09,200
kinetic controlling the system so it's

671
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:13,220
important to know volatility to use

672
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:16,098
volatility for these cases all the data

673
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:19,580
there were in the artifact station do

674
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:23,170
correspond to what appears in the memory

675
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,170
in the RAM memory at this precise moment

676
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:37,310
and we finish

677
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,310
this part

678
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:48,200
now we get to go to the last demo so

679
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:52,810
extraction of a hard drive partition of

680
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:57,790
a hard drive of various elements in this

681
00:43:52,810 --> 00:44:02,540
Google cloud we're going to use

682
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:06,110
configured program week we are going to

683
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:08,960
connect will extract partitions of this

684
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:13,370
driving the enough forensic environment

685
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:17,630
we can go to a bucket in the storage in

686
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:21,109
Google we can do it also but here we see

687
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:24,980
the Google cloud platform we have our

688
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:27,950
platform here let's see what happens

689
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:32,540
what I do at the beginning with all the

690
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:34,759
instances that exists I Cho choose the

691
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,350
one I selected version 7 which is

692
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:43,160
enterprise and here you have the

693
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:48,549
features the cost of this environment it

694
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:51,259
doesn't matter because I had some server

695
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:54,100
some several dollars to test so I

696
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,100
believe in it

697
00:44:54,850 --> 00:45:01,660
location is important this is our

698
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,660
machine it's working

699
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:10,430
CPUs it's a very basic machine the

700
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:13,790
drives of this machine that are created

701
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:20,870
by defect 10 gigas we have no capture no

702
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:26,660
snapshot or whatsoever and this is the

703
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:29,750
Italy let's do a capture a snapshot of

704
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:32,690
what's happening about this precise

705
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:35,810
instance we can do it visually but if we

706
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:39,610
have a fire the best is to do it through

707
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:39,610
the command line the console

708
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:55,540
well it takes some time let's analyze

709
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:59,259
the sentence you have eg cloud you type

710
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:03,849
the project you identify the instance

711
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:05,130
and what we're gonna see now is the fact

712
00:46:03,849 --> 00:46:08,800
that we're going to create a snapshot

713
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:10,119
that will be named precisely like I said

714
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,830
it takes some time

715
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:18,490
we have shortened to the time we are

716
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:22,029
using a basic version and at the other

717
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:29,080
day cloud computation takes takes its

718
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:32,619
time here there's a hard drive in

719
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:36,340
captures it is not theirs for the moment

720
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:44,200
it's still processing when it finishes

721
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:46,359
we'll see that in the drive file let's

722
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:55,919
do an image snapshot let's see the

723
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:58,230
difference with an image so we pushed it

724
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:03,720
hasn't finished yet

725
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:03,720
now it's there finished it's done

726
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:13,130
it doesn't refresh properly but anyway

727
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:21,839
let's browse and here we see a snapshot

728
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:24,480
ready it's here I don't only want to do

729
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:27,240
a snapshot I do anything that it's

730
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,950
required I've done a snapshot because I

731
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,180
can't stop the environment I have to do

732
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,450
it very quickly

733
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:37,140
and now have the possibility to create

734
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:41,430
an image for this purpose I have to stop

735
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:45,600
the machine I'm doing it now and I

736
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:49,440
launch another command for the creation

737
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:54,299
of new images we've done it more rapidly

738
00:47:49,440 --> 00:48:00,390
here I have the created image for saber

739
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:03,380
cam I run the process in a rapid mode

740
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:08,700
and I have the our image the information

741
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:12,720
is quite scarce in the command process

742
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:14,669
it's richer and here I could make an

743
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,970
instance there's another post that is

744
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:28,560
associated different environments cost

745
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:35,790
without one are going to do it now here

746
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:38,759
the message is created done all the

747
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:43,650
details are going to be sent to my

748
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:45,630
github the instance it can run again

749
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:49,470
because we already have the image so we

750
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:53,420
can continue its own operation and these

751
00:48:49,470 --> 00:49:00,750
are different elements each provider

752
00:48:53,420 --> 00:49:04,140
this is a storage a file with the image

753
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:09,990
that I created through the command line

754
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:13,140
or the web I can send it here with it

755
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:17,040
this is eh it's launched from the web

756
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:20,670
you don't need to have client installs

757
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:27,170
which you can do it but that you have

758
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:33,510
the option you you enter from there and

759
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:37,350
you see what's in the instance we can

760
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:39,150
the dvv and we can send you can compress

761
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:43,130
said we can do a lot of things with this

762
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:43,130
from the the instance itself

763
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:55,930
we have added a we have our Klee and

764
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:06,950
then we can send it to our PC or to a

765
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:19,249
bucket let's see if I stopped it with

766
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:21,980
this instruction this rau I wanted to

767
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:26,930
include in my D in Drive in my machine

768
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:28,970
in the file called evidence it could go

769
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:33,348
to a bucket of course we only need to

770
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:41,319
change the instruction and g-cloud is

771
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:44,749
the command is SCP so we run it

772
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:46,730
depending on the weight on the size it

773
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:49,700
says it's okay it's clear

774
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:53,869
the time that it takes it's quite long

775
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:56,450
ish so I accelerate the process and

776
00:50:53,869 --> 00:51:00,529
that's it and we can apply other

777
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:01,220
commands for integrity I said it's

778
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:05,390
important

779
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:15,129
from there we're doing and I'm DS 556

780
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:18,078
whatever that's quite powerful and here

781
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:21,890
this is from a colleague Tony de la

782
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:24,650
Fuente this slide was taken from his

783
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:30,019
presentation and it's very interesting

784
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:35,180
indeed the here we have a series of

785
00:51:30,019 --> 00:51:39,879
tasks that he runs when there's an

786
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:42,950
incident a security incident and

787
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:47,839
something that you can manage for

788
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:50,720
instance the case yeah we see a process

789
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,538
that is quite nice to see of all the

790
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,269
tasks that are carried out but you need

791
00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:57,739
time for this at the end when there are

792
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:59,269
instances that are compromised do you

793
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,700
see the process if it's dead if it's

794
00:51:59,269 --> 00:52:04,629
alive

795
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:09,220
there's a series of applications then

796
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:13,839
you have to read it with time all the

797
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:18,009
forensics stations that can be used the

798
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:23,558
tools we've seen some of them a whole

799
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:26,849
process that at the end of the day has

800
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:30,040
to be automatized automated automated

801
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:32,950
and you can create a case with the

802
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:35,380
provider so the more automated it is the

803
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:38,319
better especially in the main levels at

804
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:42,430
the beginning all this part has to be

805
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:45,790
automated then there's a point when we

806
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:50,919
have to do a manual work but in this

807
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:54,279
cases a time is money this is the last

808
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,440
part my conclusions we have to make

809
00:52:54,280 --> 00:53:00,220
differences from the point of view of

810
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:05,109
the client that gives service these

811
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:06,578
points are fundamental we need to create

812
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:09,549
these environments from the point of

813
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:13,690
view of security of IT security because

814
00:53:09,549 --> 00:53:16,150
normally if there is a store it's

815
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:18,040
critical for the store or the client

816
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,210
that customer service are critical so

817
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,390
you have to see it from the point of

818
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:24,339
view security as four pallets that's

819
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:26,470
fundamental people managing these

820
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:29,078
environments have to be careful about

821
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:32,859
islets that you need to have a refined

822
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:34,420
system of alerts and alarms in all your

823
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:36,578
developments you need to have a strong

824
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:38,829
auditing behind it

825
00:53:36,579 --> 00:53:41,710
auditing all the systems and all the

826
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:43,569
people who work and for all developments

827
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:45,940
you need control over that and from the

828
00:53:43,569 --> 00:53:51,250
point of view of what would give people

829
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:53,579
we people giving service we need to have

830
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:56,440
the permissions and the authorizations

831
00:53:53,579 --> 00:54:00,210
that we have an action plan for each

832
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:04,150
customer so it's our responsibility to

833
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:07,030
ask for those permissions otherwise we

834
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:10,420
can't offer that our service

835
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:16,200
it's important also to have a resource

836
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:19,510
pool we can have spree software or

837
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,029
proprietary software but you didn't you

838
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:26,410
don't need to marry with anyone in

839
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:29,710
particular choose whatever you like in

840
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:31,930
Prosecco we we have the cellar right for

841
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:33,580
mobile devices because it's a rapid

842
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:37,060
service which can do a lot of things in

843
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:40,540
it's a proprietary service but we can

844
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:43,570
use free so free software so just that's

845
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:45,250
just not not a single choice choose

846
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:51,730
whatever you like and we need a

847
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:55,480
continuous training you have to be a

848
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:57,670
well all not new elements in security

849
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,220
have to be a hundred percent updated

850
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:03,790

851
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:06,549
