can see it from the house thank you very

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,119
much for being here I know that it's a

13
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:20,090
difficult time I know last year we knew

14
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,650
that we're going to things were gonna go

15
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:26,180
well but we didn't think we were gonna

16
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,850
win Loretto karenacaracas this last year

17
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,250
we knew that there was a challenge ahead

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,229
of us we knew it was going to be very

19
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,450
difficult to win because there were many

20
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:39,650
teams very brilliant teams and another

21
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:45,320
challenge was to organize this event as

22
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:46,430
hosts and I was wrong I was wrong and I

23
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:55,850
think that in the end

24
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:57,530
apart from winning we hit the target I'd

25
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,439
like to congratulate my colleagues

26
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:05,080
who've organized this you've taken care

27
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:09,459
of the of all the logistics

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:11,670

30
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:20,369
organization and some of them are not

wearing it but so okay I'm gonna try and

32
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,290
facilitate this in order to know about

33
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,770
our experience first of all I'd like to

34
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:32,230
ask a general sort of question because

35
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,560
they know what the competition is what I

36
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,320
like but I want to know who knows about

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,850

big round of applause for her

225
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:10,199
so while we say goodbye to our granny

226
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:13,229
now I'm going to relaunch the question I

227
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,270
asked before how many of you is familiar

228
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,360
with this I become security challenged

229
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:20,460
well most of you haven't heard of it

230
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,550
so I'm going to give you an overview

231
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,640
it's a test promoted by the cyber

232
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:31,229
security agency and the EU and all the

233
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:35,550
countries have a national team so in

234
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:38,130
order to have a national team we need to

235
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,260
make a selection out of cyber camp or a

236
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,620
similar thing that is organised in each

237
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,960
of the countries here we've seen the

238
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,480
cyber Olympics for example each team is

239
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:54,480
made up of 10 teams 5 of them are

240
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:56,460
juniors that is they are younger than 20

241
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,450
years of age and then another range of

242
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:03,780
age between 21 and 25 so out of this

243
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:07,430
selection and with this age filter we

244
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:11,240
draft the national team every year

245
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:14,849
thanks to our general director and

246
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,640
operations director I have been working

247
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,880
for the national team for a few years

248
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:24,960
and I'm really proud to work with this

249
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,230
group of people year by year this year

250
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:31,100
half of the teams stay the same the

251
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:33,540
other half is new members and they are

252
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,870
fascinating every conversation you have

253
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,490
with them whether it is in the hotel or

254
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,860
having a drink outside they're always

255
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,620
thinking about how to get better and

256
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,660
share information because those kind of

257
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:51,150
professionals this kind of profiles

258
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:53,719
usually compete against each other we

259
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:57,500
have seen next-door that our people were

260
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:02,760
competing on an individual basis however

261
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:03,990
here as they said to cyber granny they

262
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,040
know each other very well and they

263
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:12,390
almost passwords that's true and this is

264
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,530
something we work on very hard during

265
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:17,580
training this is

266
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:22,440
not only about technical issues we try

267
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:27,139
to build a team and build social skills

268
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:29,880
so there are solid social and personal

269
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:33,450
relationships here I wanted to mention

270

- Iliad ASA feels technical skill there

294
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,450
are several technical challenges that

295
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,850
enable them to automate certain

296
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:18,630
techniques and to work in group the

297
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:22,709
national team is built on two teams they

298
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:26,120
have several systems and they try to get

299
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,120

we're gonna stay so I think this video

303
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,530
gives you an overview of part of what

304
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,540
happened during these trainings not

305
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,350
everything there's always something that

306
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:38,170
we keep for ourselves the organization

307
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:42,610
reminded me to tell you about the

308
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:45,010
technical staff we've had two main

309
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,969
trainers but there were all the people

310
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:50,770
involved and we always tried to leverage

311
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:52,960
the knowledge of the people who've

312
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:56,560
participated in the national team on the

313
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:00,070
year before and that sometimes cannot

314
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,510
continue participating for example Danny

315
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:05,020
or Carlos who wasn't feeling well and

316
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:08,050
had to leave Dallas was in Colombia with

317
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,530
Antonio right now so these people were

318
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:14,440
very helpful it wouldn't have been

319
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,690
possible without them so I went to ask

320
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,690
for a big round of applause to the

321
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:24,040
mentors and to the entire technical team

322
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:31,660
that made this possible I would also

323
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:37,210
like to mention that we have reserves we

324
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:40,570
have the selection that with them that

325
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:43,780
we do with a capture flag we perform

326
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:47,139
training exercises and that's how we

327
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:51,000
build the team based on several concrete

328
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:56,290
profiles and we cover all needs

329
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,480
cryptography with saying etc so in any

330
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:03,399
case it's always good to have a research

331
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:06,190
staff in order to count on them if there

332
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,400
is trouble now I would like to move on

333
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:13,300
to a more technical part I know a lot of

334
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,040
young people here are eager to help so I

335
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:19,180
would like now

336
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:23,200
a two of the members of the team tell

337
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:26,590
you about two challenges that they had

338
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,110
to face and they are going to tell you

339
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,879
also how they solved it so now I'm going

340
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:33,340
to give the floor to host and man well

341
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:43,480
if you wanna burn a previous target on

342
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:47,320
teriyaki money a my a percent are you

343
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:50,080
necessary I'm going to show you several

344
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:55,030
challenges that we solved in the

345
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,610
European challenge the team is very

346
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:01,000
peculiar as you've seen we all have

347
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:06,820
different profiles and different senses

348
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,640
of humor and the challenge actually is

349
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:13,300
to make these people work together as a

350
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:16,330
team so it's not so much about technical

351
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:20,770
capabilities of course we have them as

352
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:25,510
the rest of the teams but these are

353
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:27,639
usually individualistic profiles and

354
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:32,260
what we measure here is whether they are

355
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:35,140
able to work together as a team the

356
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:39,270
competition was made up of three

357
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:42,370
different challenges there were hardware

358
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,950
challenges you were given a board for

359
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,979
example with a transmitter and an

360
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:51,850
emitter then there was a keyword for

361
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:54,400
example for a safe box that we had to

362
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:58,030
bypass then there was another challenge

363
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:03,310
regarding smart cards and then there

364
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:05,770
were all the other challenges within a

365
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:08,320
scenario with different stages that's

366
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:11,290
what we call G operty and then there

367
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,889
were two other GOP challenges that went

368
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:17,020
related among them here we had reversing

369
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,910
exploiting cryptography reverse

370
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,910
engineering abilities etc

371
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:32,280
so I'm going to explain three challenges

372
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:35,700
that were related the goal was to obtain

373
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:39,480
a route or a privileged access to a

374
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:43,110
target machine we only had the IP for

375
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:46,170
that machine so we had to go through a

376
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:49,139
recognition face the attacker was made

377
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:54,000
up of three phases there was a logging

378
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:56,360
form that we had to bypass by means that

379
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,040
I will explain later on then we had to

380
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:05,909
run remote code through our F I and then

381
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:09,360
we had to S scale privileges in the

382
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:11,730
machine the SQL injection was like this

383
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,889
there was a web login for portable

384
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,770
devices for mobile devices and it was

385
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:19,950
vulnerable to SQL injection you would

386
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:23,340
type in the string and then you would

387
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:26,640
have access to the login here we can see

388
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:29,939
how it was attacked with rivers but

389
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,890
actually you could see the flag I didn't

390
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:36,180
want to display the flag in the

391
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:39,750
presentation but anyway this would lead

392
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:43,110
you or would give you the hint that

393
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:46,350
there was an ID filled with something

394
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:51,929
weird in it the SQL code is pretty

395
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:55,500
simple and it actually checked that

396
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:58,050
there was just one role returning or

397
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:02,730
reversing the query this is one example

398
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:07,290
you use the inverted comma and if you

399
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:10,290
see it fails you tried with dashes or

400
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:14,460
with different things when you see it's

401
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:18,740
vulnerable you finally achieve the login

402
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:24,120
bypass here you couldn't extract the

403
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:27,480
database as such but at least you had a

404
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,270
blind for secure injection but that was

405
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,840
basically it

406
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:37,950
from the ID field we could see that we

407
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:42,030
could inject carried calling a route

408
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:48,830
that was in remote server in order to

409
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:53,910
check how it worked we launched a server

410
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:56,639
and we saw how the cold behaved in this

411
00:27:53,910 --> 00:28:02,130
case we were able to see how it adds a

412
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:06,150
dot txt file to the parameter that is an

413
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:11,550
important point since it was PHP it

414
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:19,170
would run any PHP file having that

415
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:22,830
txt so we would disclose and then cut

416
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:31,200
and one two three four for example we

417
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:34,919
prepared a reverse shell in PHP and then

418
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:40,950
we would launch the request and obtained

419
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:43,770
the shell here we have how the shell is

420
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:50,010
received the commands that are run by

421
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:53,639
default and the ID as well this was

422
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:58,230
strictly necessary this kind of shell is

423
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:01,470
uncomfortable to work with so we updated

424
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:06,330
to meterpreter in order to get this we

425
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:09,360
generated a payload with reverse tc3 we

426
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,939
uploaded with the other shell and we run

427
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,449
it so when the multi handler was

428
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:18,600
launched with meta exploit we got the

429
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:21,530
incoming execution here we can see how

430
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,530
it would look like

431
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:30,039
and from this moment on we have local

432
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,409
access to the machine but the user

433
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:37,739
doesn't have privileges we need to

434
00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:41,169
escalate or scale privileges or rights

435
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:45,669
the solution was very simple but it took

436
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:49,450
us quite a while to find it in the end

437
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:51,849
the shadow file not the password only

438
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:55,629
the shadow could be written on

439
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:58,029
overwritten so if we changed the first

440
00:29:55,629 --> 00:30:01,509
line we would change the harsh to the

441
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:07,649
root user and says since you changed

442
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:10,389
this you gain access to the machine and

443
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:12,758
in this kind of challenge you need to

444
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:15,998
thank outside the box sometimes because

445
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:19,029
the solution may be simple but you

446
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:20,950
cannot find it neither you know the

447
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:23,379
other 15 countries in the competition

448
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,359
which is very curious now I'm going to

449
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:28,149
give the floor over to Manuel is going

450
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:31,418
to tell you about a reverse engineering

451
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:36,219
challenge which is a bit more visual and

452
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:42,639
therefore more impressive hello my name

453
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:47,769
is mano Langer and I'm trying to give

454
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:50,349
you detail brief of how we solve a

455
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:55,419
reverse engineering challenge have you

456
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:59,830
ever heard about red area this logo it's

457
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:03,429
reverse engineering framework and we

458
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:07,478
will carry out a concept engineering

459
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:10,720
test with it when we have the binary we

460
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:13,989
can see that it has an extension that

461
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,320
makes us think that it may be a portable

462
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:21,489
executable file but if we use an

463
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:24,908
integrated command we see that this is a

464
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:28,720
32 bit elf that has been statically

465
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:33,309
linked therefore it contains all the

466
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,869
functions and it hasn't been ripped off

467
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:36,460
its symbols

468
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:38,230
therefore the reverse

469
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:46,090
Engineering proces is going to be pretty

470
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:49,230
simple the first problem is to know

471
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:53,199
where the flag is reverse engineering is

472
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:55,690
approaches in which you have a final

473
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,660
result and then you use several

474
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:03,370
methodologies and procedures in order to

475
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:07,780
find out how the binary or the solution

476
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:11,320
was created in this case we have a

477
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:18,430
retiree solution a very simple solution

478
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:21,030
that enables us to see this the most

479
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:24,340
noticeable thing is a number of

480
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:27,940
transfers that we can see highlighted

481
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:32,850
here in this screenshot first the

482
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:35,530
rewrite the flag it's usually string and

483
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:43,060
then in the position where the flag is

484
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:47,520
it is overwritten so this indicates that

485
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:52,450
there's probably some sort of string

486
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:56,110
that's why we are going to try to

487
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:59,260
achieve the flag if we launch Rodari

488
00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:02,949
with the minus d order we do it in a

489
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:05,050
debugger mode so when we try to run it

490
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:11,260
it detects that there is a debugger

491
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:13,930
attached and we get a string saying that

492
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:17,680
binary debugging is not allowed so what

493
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:21,220
can we do the first thing that came to

494
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:24,250
mind was to find cross references we

495
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:27,160
were looking for the famous B trace

496
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:29,320
function and we saw there was this cross

497
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:34,720
reference in a symbol and the check

498
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:36,970
function and that was very clearly we

499
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,250
could see very clearly that the

500
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:42,760
was the way to go it so the next step

501
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:48,010
was to perform a bypass and our case we

502
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:54,070
decided to patch here we have small

503
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:57,790
reference from the P trace manual and of

504
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:59,590
course before we go to the patching we

505
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,200
had to see how the check function is

506
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:05,530
working here we have the basic blocks

507
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:09,010
and this function with the next command

508
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:12,969
with red re - so this is a very basic

509
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:14,410
block there is a call to P trays and

510
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:17,169
depending on the result of that

511
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:18,670
validation there is a part popping up

512
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:21,010
saying that the process is being

513
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:25,060
debugged on the other hand it goes to

514
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:28,080
the right hand side and it leaves us if

515
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:32,560
we as if we hadn't debunked the process

516
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,980
so the first approach in order to solve

517
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,590
this problem is to change the

518
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:41,350
conditional leap and make it leave to

519
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:47,130
the part where it isn't debunked so

520
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:50,500
radar e2 is very versatile because it

521
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:53,860
attracts us from the architecture given

522
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:56,739
this very simple order command that you

523
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:58,840
can see on the stress on the screen we

524
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:01,979
can alter it

525
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,979
[Music]

526
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:10,230
having to change the opie code manually

527
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:13,990
which would be another possibility but

528
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:16,660
that would involve knowing about the

529
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:19,089
instruction set of Intel for this

530
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,220
architecture and also knowing about how

531
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:24,610
architectures are configured so with

532
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:27,100
this very simple command we can make it

533
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:31,600
leap to the part where it's not being

534
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:35,770
debugged so in this case we have to use

535
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:39,370
W for writing now we reload it again in

536
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:42,360
debugging mode we can see where the flag

537
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:46,180
is in the beginning we can see that

538
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:49,049
local Dutch 64 is a reference to stack

539
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:54,430
frame and it's

540
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:56,799
deduct an offset of 64 bytes so after

541
00:35:54,430 --> 00:36:00,190
the flag is written we continue with the

542
00:35:56,799 --> 00:36:05,950
C and we see what we have in this

543
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:09,789
reference it shows the hexadecimal frame

544
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:14,410
and to the left we have the result in

545
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:16,980
hexadecimal mode and then in ASCII to

546
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:20,589
the left and this is how we got the flag

547
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,480
with this process thank you for your

548
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:26,009
attention

549
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:30,460
[Applause]

550
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:33,910
Thank You Manuel so you you're not

551
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,000
running a demo are you okay this is how

552
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:39,609
the presentation is going to go let's

553
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,029
continue there is an important issue I

554
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:50,500
forgot to mention I checked my notes and

555
00:36:43,029 --> 00:36:53,279
I realize that well team the national

556
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:57,819
team has been the host this is a

557
00:36:53,279 --> 00:37:02,289
responsibility 15 teams actually 14 and

558
00:36:57,819 --> 00:37:05,849
ourselves in total 15 teams in a

559
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:08,680
beautiful city Malaga wonderful weather

560
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:12,420
there is a language barrier that we need

561
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:19,328
to overcome so in this training we also

562
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:22,450
tried to boost English not all the tests

563
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:24,789
are technical there is a public

564
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,430
presentation that has to be in English

565
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:28,990
and our colleague Jose was able to do it

566
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:32,980
pretty well but we always have trouble

567
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:36,519
with English I have to admit that you

568
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:39,880
have surprised me because in the end you

569
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:44,200
ended up speaking English very well

570
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,990
you've been great hosts and as the hours

571
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:51,160
went by you were able to speak to

572
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:54,399
everybody and even better and of course

573
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,279
we partied because we deserved it

574
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,410
so congratulations as far as the English

575
00:37:57,279 --> 00:38:01,710
language knowledge is concerned and for

576
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,730
your hosting ability is

577
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:06,520
regarding the tests there are

578
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:10,690
radiofrequency tests digital

579
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:13,630
lock-picking opening locks with our

580
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:18,099
control mechanisms but I think the best

581
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:20,020
of it all is going to be in this video

582
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:22,329
that we've prepared and it's all about

583
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,850
this experience please if you can play

584
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:30,849

Monica what I'm in there was how you put

608
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:19,619
well as you can imagine with a very

609
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:23,710
tough jewelry with extraordinary teams

610
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:27,549
against us this was a huge challenge we

611
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:31,869
are here as if this was dead easy but it

612
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:34,930
was extraordinarily complicated it's 15

613
00:42:31,869 --> 00:42:39,339
countries competing probably five more

614
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:44,339
next year in order to reach a goal of 28

615
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:46,720
countries I wanted to stress also

616
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:50,589
something that we may be able to do

617
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,819
something about the European Commission

618
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:57,930
is promoting gender equality and

619
00:42:53,819 --> 00:43:01,000
unfortunately there are very few women

620
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:06,520
interested in this kind of competitions

621
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:09,240
so if you know you hear and people who

622
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,990
are watching from home if you know

623
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:15,279
female colleagues because there are some

624
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:17,950
because some of them aren't even aware

625
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,640
of the existence of cyber camp so if you

626
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:23,439
know girls with these profiles please

627
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,660
let them know because we are interested

628
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:32,079
we are very interested in contacting

629
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:34,509
them so before calling mentors and the

630
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,180
rest of the team and asking them to join

631
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:40,660
me up on the stage I wanted to open a

632
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:43,359
Q&A session because I think it's

633
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:47,140
interesting that you can share your

634
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:50,319
questions or your comments in relation

635
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:53,259
to this experience as one of the goals

636
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:59,170
we have here today is to encourage you

637
00:43:53,260 --> 00:44:02,109
to participate in cyber camp to see that

638
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:07,430
this goes beyond having fun and winning

639
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:11,640
prizes so please

640
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:15,180
if you would like to ask questions to

641
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:19,859
the team please go ahead it would be

642
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:26,850
interesting that we heard you mentors do

643
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:31,200
you have questions come on I know it's

644
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:33,950
late tatty isn't there anything you

645
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,830
would like to ask the national team

646
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:40,230
if Iniesta or the hurom was one of the

647
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:41,400
Spanish soccer national teams play over

648
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:53,850
here I'm sure you would have a lot of

649
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:56,970
questions hello and congratulations to

650
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:59,720
you all because you've been great

651
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:02,490
representatives of spanking this

652
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:05,870
challenges you've mentioned Iniesta and

653
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:09,270
all the soccer players these players

654
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:12,900
have a long background in the end they

655
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:15,870
go to First Division team and then they

656
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:19,050
go to the national team what is your

657
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:23,339
background what is the path you have to

658
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:24,990
walk and tell you get inside this team

659
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:30,000
that's what I would like to know

660
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:33,750
actually and also have to tell you that

661
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:39,060
I'm very jealous because you are awesome

662
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:43,380
I was impressed by the presentations and

663
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:45,630
I also encouraged them to take advantage

664
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,760
of the fact that they have so much

665
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:50,700
information available when I started in

666
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,010
this world I had to read manuals that

667
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,680
were this thick so thank you very much

668
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:59,150
well I will answer the first question

669
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:02,009
the national team is made up by

670
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:05,850
competitors who have given proof of

671
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:08,700
their potential as the cyber camp model

672
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:12,180
goes in cyber Olympics that is the

673
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:14,390
school competition as in the CDF the

674
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:17,850
individual competition Dave or

675
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:21,410
participated in CDF or cyber Olympics

676
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:21,410
with their own schools

677
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:26,460
some of them didn't participate last

678
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:29,070
year but maybe two years ago so they've

679
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:32,220
all participated in cyber camp and the

680
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:36,870
cyber Olympics I think it's pretty

681
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:39,810
reasonable and what we do is after their

682
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:41,970
participation in city if we get an

683
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:47,430
individual report with the

684
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:49,830
characteristics of each of them so just

685
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:52,200
like in this soccer team we try to have

686
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:57,150
the best goalkeeper the best for water

687
00:46:52,200 --> 00:47:00,210
etc so as long as the basic requirements

688
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:02,490
the H requirements are met and another

689
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:06,450
requirement which is that they are not

690
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:09,330
at work when they are drawn this is

691
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:12,259
changed in the first year you could take

692
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:16,560
people up to 30 years of age and then

693
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:20,940
they changed that rule and then they

694
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:24,509
cannot be over 25 now so our captain

695
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:26,490
cosa is turning 26 this year say he

696
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,620
won't be able to continue with us as

697
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:30,049
well as other competitors that now have

698
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:34,950
become Mentors

699
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:38,580
so that would be the answers they need

700
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:40,200
to participate in cyber camp so this is

701
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:43,049
the answer to the first question I think

702
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:48,299
any of you have if you would like to

703
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:51,260
answer to the second one well my

704
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:55,350
recommendation is passion devotion I

705
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:59,880
take things very seriously I spent hours

706
00:47:55,350 --> 00:48:02,850
and and hacking practicing exercise and

707
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:08,810
creating virtual machines and this is

708
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:12,240
the key have devotion and passion i hack

709
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:14,580
during sleepless nights I sleep only 3-4

710
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:17,430
hours a day sometime so it's your

711
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:20,610
passion err you have to love this I love

712
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:22,270
this myself I could be working on this

713
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:25,180
for hours and end

714
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:28,060
and that's something I love and for

715
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:30,430
example in my case I don't have any

716
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:33,009
academic background and you don't need

717
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:35,830
anything like that you just need a gern

718
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:39,430
s and willingness anything else that you

719
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:41,920
would like to add I think it's important

720
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:45,009
what you were saying having a passion is

721
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:50,620
great if you are at home and you're not

722
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:54,760
used to our this way of competing in

723
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:57,339
CDF's this is not about being evil we

724
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:01,600
are working on the future cyber security

725
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:03,160
profiles that is people who are able to

726
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:12,069
prove as in the presentations you've

727
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:15,850
been able to see people who can show and

728
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:19,780
solve security issues and breaches so

729
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:24,910
all the hours that Borka devotes to this

730
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:26,830
are probably in favor of as a whole so

731
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:28,480
well sometimes you need to be offensive

732
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,970
of course in order to know where they

733
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,280
are coming from but not to be evil but

734
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,569
to protect ourselves rather I don't know

735
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,860
if there are any more questions thank

736
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:41,620
you for the question by the way well

737
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:47,590
since we're running out of time I would

738
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:49,540
like to ask some people here to join me

739
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,520
up on the stage my colleagues from in

740
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,460
seebut at the ANA hotel their trees

741
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,940
please a big round of applause to them

742
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,380
all

743
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:00,750
[Applause]

744
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:05,430
the tiene and the trees play a very

745
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:08,150
important role without them this

746
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:13,049
competition wouldn't have taken place in

747
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:15,300
Malaga I think well this is the only

748
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:19,170
time we are meant to organise it it

749
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:20,970
takes a lot of effort and it's very good

750
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:22,950
that we make it there we have to

751
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:25,290
organise or they have to organise either

752
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:28,169
camp furs they have to organise training

753
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:30,900
logistics they have to build a solid

754
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,910
team and they are working very hard in

755
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:36,270
this sense since they are always in the

756
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:38,790
backstage I want them to be really up on

757
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:41,759
the stage though that you can clearly

758
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:45,270
see them and now please Mentors

759
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:49,950
former competitors who are still

760
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:56,070
competing and winning please join us on

761
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:58,799
the stage well remoted and Dani always

762
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:02,460
wins something and Cybercom how did you

763
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:08,460
score today we were fifth I was 22nd

764
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:16,490
well he warned last June actually that

765
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:19,260
lack today okay so I just wanted you to

766
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:22,759
introduce you to the team and the people

767
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:26,400
who's behind I would like to thank our

768
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,410
managers who support us because it's

769
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,760
hard to be here day by day we're

770
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:35,870
passionate about it we love hacking we

771
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:39,120
are here to learn rather than to teach

772
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:43,920
because youngsters have a lot to say and

773
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:47,509
love to teach and a lot of us would like

774
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:51,480
to be here learning we have such a big

775
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:55,380
workload that we unfortunately miss many

776
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:58,590
of the conference's so please the last

777
00:51:55,380 --> 00:52:01,910
round of applause to the entire team and

778
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,910
if you can us

779
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:10,190
