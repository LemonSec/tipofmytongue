1
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,320
gonna but good afternoon I'm going to

2
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:36,620
introduce myself

3
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,620
Miguel Correa I PhD students in

4
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:48,980
computing security and information by

5
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:52,170
the you see LM also security analyst in

6
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:57,080
memo and confounder of Connie's honey

7
00:00:52,170 --> 00:01:01,710
SEC in today's workshop or talk I will

8
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:05,780
speak about bad the USB and ability to

9
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,720
introduce commands or payload by

10
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:16,130
keyboard impersonation whether Windows

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:21,539
or Mac the vulnerability is the USB HID

12
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:26,060
that is the human interface for devices

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:32,250
it was created by a Microsoft employee

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:38,159
and it was introduced to USB agency the

15
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,929
idea was to just plug and play to a

16
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,310
computer without looking for

17
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:47,189
sophisticated drives in the past

18
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,340
whenever you had to introduce a keyboard

19
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:54,770
you needed the right controller and it

20
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:58,049
was quite complicated today computers

21
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:01,679
acknowledge the keyboard without a

22
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:04,890
problem and they use mainly two

23
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:08,759
interfaces read both protocols this

24
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,240
interface does not need hid which we

25
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:15,230
usually use at the by a oh you don't

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,940
need anything installed in your device

27
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:22,069
to recognize the keyboard or the mouse

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:25,620
then we have report mode that is the

29
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:30,160
interface used by the us to acknowledge

30
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:34,320
the keyboard or some of the new

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:39,040
is some of the new features like turned

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:42,810
down the computer or reboot they have

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,880
some data funds in the USB that

34
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,910
communicated to the OS to provide the

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:52,930
necessary information if there is any

36
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,970
special typology we'll also add it to

37
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,210
the interface if the keyboard had

38
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:02,080
another tactile and you will have

39
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:07,110
another interface to that aim as you see

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:12,960
on too many sites there are hundreds of

41
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:15,880
devices with USB is that can be clearly

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:25,120
seen you go to the bank and you can see

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:29,410
all USB Sun protected they acted the

44
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:33,760
same about printers and that is very

45
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:39,420
often the case in hospitals in offices

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:44,109
in they do not realize how vulnerable

47
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:46,030
these can be in just in five seconds you

48
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:50,940
can end up having a total control over

49
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:54,250
the device those are the main

50
00:03:50,940 --> 00:04:01,739
microcontrollers that we can use to do

51
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:05,650
about the USB the first is 80 mega 32 is

52
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:09,130
installed in Leonarda

53
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:13,870
is one of the first projects that

54
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:17,620
changed the firewall to create a bad USB

55
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:21,399
the second is 80 teeny is a more

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:27,100
economical version it has less memory

57
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:29,940
and it allowed more reduced pilot but is

58
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,530
very much used and the last one the

59
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,530
pison it's in

60
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,300
USBC bow or any other well-known brands

61
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:46,800
and he's very much used the flash memory

62
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:52,700
because his pen driver is defined by the

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,700
pen drive capacity 16 or 32 gigabytes

64
00:04:52,970 --> 00:05:03,200
those are the best known models the

65
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:06,180
rubber ducky ducky is quite an expensive

66
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:12,659
the Leonarda was one of the first

67
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:18,740
devices and the ovipositor that in

68
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,740
addition to be a bad USB is the physical

69
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:28,760
key logger from phoenix company those

70
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,490
are the most economical versions

71
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,920
manufactured in China that we can find

72
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,390
in Internet the first you can see in

73
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:43,620
this light it does not have micro as a

74
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:46,620
d-cup that allow us to change the script

75
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:51,240
without a flash in the chip if we want

76
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:54,120
to change if we want to add new commands

77
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:59,040
with the keyboard we had to flash the

78
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:02,670
whole the chip again in the micro SD

79
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:06,150
Inlet this wouldn't be needed we might

80
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:08,400
just have to change the file what you

81
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,429
see in the lower part is rather simple

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:16,159
project which is adding Wi-Fi you can

83
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:19,950
always add Wi-Fi with a small FTP host

84
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,810
or you can upload the files were

85
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:29,159
interested in passwords in Windows or

86
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:33,330
wherever this is one of the latest

87
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:37,920
models and as I said before it because

88
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:41,729
the micro is the inlet from 8 to 10

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:44,879
euros that's the price now for

90
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:50,009
installing we have two repositories

91
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:54,089
we have a Stefan Crimson German security

92
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:58,649
analyst and Ernesto I don't know if you

93
00:06:54,089 --> 00:07:00,689
know nestor he is very often in

94
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:04,559
Congress's he's given a very interesting

95
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:07,469
talk in Barcelona about hacking and they

96
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:16,619
both work quite well and I use her

97
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:20,998
Nestor's because it's closer to me is as

98
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:24,199
easy as to download Arduino IDE and

99
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:27,439
install the software I will do

100
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,439
demonstration now

101
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,990
[Music]

102
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,508
what about a fun distraction - Yamamoto

103
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,509
is our simple as this

104
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:36,478
Al Gore we've added the code that we

105
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,750
will compile our day microcontroller we

106
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,229
just have to add open and at the

107
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:46,560
firewall of the downloaded repository

108
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:50,520
and we press install there are different

109
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,000
things to be taken into account for this

110
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,000
process

111
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,510
as for example the library's Arduino

112
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,920
does not know that we have a Spanish

113
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:18,670
keyboard will be any and not only that

114
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:25,089
some other changes in the key and they

115
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:27,790
might have some others as Tomas so we

116
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,760
download the Puna library we'll have to

117
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:34,209
replace the main folder so that it

118
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:38,920
acknowledges the Spanish keyboard it all

119
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:41,140
depends on our objective whether if we

120
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,620
know there is no Spanish user then it

121
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:51,250
will be any other keyboard oh another

122
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:55,240
step is to select the device and to

123
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:58,180
simplify the use of this installation

124
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,480
without compiling having to compile

125
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:06,370
anything we can just add it using the

126
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:10,420
arduino system this is one of the most

127
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:13,780
simple scripts that we can enter we can

128
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,810
write in a notepad send the characters

129
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,990
chain and print

130
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:23,650
hola mundo or allow the world this

131
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:28,300
script system has a sub script system

132
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:31,090
created by high pi and it's very simple

133
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:37,180
it's got some similarities with other

134
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:41,620
programming systems but not too many in

135
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:47,199
C unbasic it governments with RAM and is

136
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:51,490
rather intuitive here we have a wonder

137
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,130
is more intrusive basically all commands

138
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:57,340
that will interact more with the system

139
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:01,390
will have to be directly in Power Cell

140
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:04,480
and that depends on our imagination as I

141
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,850
said usually we should introduce a delay

142
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,269
from 1 to 3 seconds

143
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:16,299
so that the computer has the chance the

144
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:18,429
hid to keep the communication so that it

145
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:21,009
knows that is keyboard we're talking

146
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:24,639
about here we see how simple it is to

147
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:28,600
deactivate Windows Defender that is the

148
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:31,419
protection system people have read many

149
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,639
comments in internet of people let's say

150
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,189
that you don't need antivirus that we

151
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,759
with Windows Defender is enough and this

152
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:43,209
is a way that just in five seconds you

153
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:45,489
can deactivate Windows Defender and then

154
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:49,959
what you want to add this is a small

155
00:11:45,489 --> 00:11:53,049
script but you can go on with the rest

156
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:57,368
of the options here we have the mimic

157
00:11:53,049 --> 00:12:02,259
art I don't know if you know it is a

158
00:11:57,369 --> 00:12:11,889
small script that compiles all Windows

159
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:15,789
passwords in copy demo and here how easy

160
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:19,869
it is to download a file and executed in

161
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:27,479
five seconds we can execute any file in

162
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:32,259
a computer here in this website we have

163
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:37,720
different payloads rubber Ducky's the

164
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:44,399
main is this a file website it has many

165
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:44,399
many payloads for hundreds of users

166
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:53,319
Windows Linux we just have to change a

167
00:12:47,949 --> 00:13:01,868
few commands for example when you please

168
00:12:53,319 --> 00:13:04,868
oh you are says that is for Windows but

169
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:11,889
the same can be used for Mac did you

170
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:15,410
change the key and this would be some of

171
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:19,940
the systems protection systems

172
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:23,010
by companies or individuals we have

173
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:25,680
GData it was one of the first ones to

174
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:30,770
include this protection in their

175
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:35,219
security pack anti-virus and some other

176
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,900
uses and you have a warning with a

177
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,170
message that there is another keyboard

178
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,620
in the device and whether you want to

179
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:46,140
stop it or continue working with it then

180
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:50,130
we have the small script made in Python

181
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:55,290
by Miguel Arroyo there is a similar

182
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:59,840
system it detects the keyboard but you

183
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:02,810
have to execute the script beforehand

184
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:08,360
and now I'm going to do a small

185
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:08,359
demonstration of the rubber ducky

186
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:38,140
this is a smaller script a visual script

187
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:40,300
if you don't want to make it visual we

188
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,220
just have to introduce the commands to

189
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,880
access the website under file is

190
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:50,350
downloaded that you will see at the

191
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:54,430
desktop and this file is now this one

192
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,860
and we have just gave indications about

193
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:00,670
where to be installed we can change this

194
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:04,120
directory we can choose any other it

195
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:08,579
doesn't have to be just a file it can be

196
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:13,769
a web shell or what it will feel like

197
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:19,140
and if you want to make any concept test

198
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:25,120
or if you have any doubt you're welcome

199
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:29,500
this is more or less the main use of the

200
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,640
rubber duck in Tunisia la pregunta do

201
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,640
you have any questions so far

202
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:59,149
I didn't remove that do you have any

203
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:03,809
questions and please use the microphone

204
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:08,579
this was the presentation so that you

205
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:11,670
could see the dangers nobody is going to

206
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:13,920
get into your house and going to do this

207
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:17,309
when they can steal your computer

208
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,099
directly but at company's level or in

209
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:22,559
hospitals or in many other public places

210
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,579
they should be concerned of these days

211
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:29,879
to deactivate the USB not only by the

212
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:42,059
software but also by Hardware and they

213
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:45,769
should deactivate them by default if you

214
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:45,769
have no further questions

215
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:54,959
you
