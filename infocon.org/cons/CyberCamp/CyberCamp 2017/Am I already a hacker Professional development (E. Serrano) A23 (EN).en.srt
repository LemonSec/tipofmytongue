site and co-founder of Armando raquel

7
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,989
something that we fund 10 years ago

8
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:57,399
there were five or six of us working in

9
00:00:52,989 --> 00:01:05,560
an office from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. every

10
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:11,710
day so we we've been doing a lot of work

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:15,580
in order to we spent many hours doing

12
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:17,800
things and we ended up hacking TV

13
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:22,509
walking around the streets with a hidden

14
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:25,210
camera and this is what made us arriving

15
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:28,140
here the way we are and we're very much

16
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:32,830
involved in this world of cybersecurity

17
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:39,850
I'm also within security IBM F for Spain

18
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:42,210
Portugal Israel in Greece and when I

19
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:46,259
started was I've been working for IBM

20
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,929
for five years now I used to do

21
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:54,840
fantastic projects ethical hacking and

22
00:01:49,930 --> 00:02:01,420
they started also doing product demos

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:05,049
after which I went into the vending

24
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,729
sector logo meant ostomy Kasturi gusta

25
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:10,620
mucho la parte de entrenamiento de I

26
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:13,360
also started working the area

27
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,880
entrepreneurship and innovation and I'll

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,760
be giving you some tips in case you

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,060
wanna set up your own business and so

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,640
always I've always worked in an area

31
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,590
related to technology

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,929
because technology is wonderful for many

33
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,780
things that people don't even imagine so

34
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,780
thank you very much for coming I know

35
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,980
that there are families here with us a

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:43,280
people who are no practitioners in this

37
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,260
area children we've got engineers all

38
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,659
sorts of profiles all sorts of people

39
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,149
and also professionals in their world

40
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:53,959
and there have been some wonderful

41
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,909
presentations and first of all I'm gonna

42
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,049
be telling you what I do outside IBM

43
00:02:55,909 --> 00:03:03,769
because in the end the IBM is my core

44
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:10,579
work and some time ago I gave a

45
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:15,560
conference in Madrid this show on TV I

46
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:18,889
don't have you soil but that program we

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:24,590
were showing how to use technology in

48
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:26,629
order to chase bad guys and so we were

49
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:28,730
able to help many people and we felt

50
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,980
very good with the program and that we

51
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:36,530
also help people to get problems with

52
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:41,828
technology so this is very important as

53
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:45,260
well as the whole awareness process the

54
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:50,989
technological gap has made it to

55
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:53,750
everybody even grandparents have a cell

56
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,180
phone and they go in the web analyst and

57
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,129
welcome anybody is trying to pay me what

58
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,370
I didn't do anything to you

59
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:03,500
I'm how come I'm being attacked so you

60
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,569
were helping our people know the

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,940
technology some people don't use

62
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,578
technology properly because they don't

63
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,090
know how to do it and they run into

64
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:17,930
trouble so what you can see here on the

65
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:20,389
slide this little box that I'm going to

66
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,680
show you later on I'm going to give you

67
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:30,800
the details this is a company for health

68
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:33,740
food take away health food the

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,210
technological part of the company orders

70
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,479
and many things it's a different

71
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,479
I don't know where technology has a very

72
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:47,270
important role to play since I've

73
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:50,969
technical background and take care of

74
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,758
Android and iPhone applications this is

75
00:04:50,970 --> 00:05:00,449
a something that I published a some time

76
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:03,690
ago and then here the feathers it's a

77
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:06,000
brand clothing brand that I've had with

78
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,910
friends for a long time you know camisa

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,190
he hit me Niq Niq sa la surfing mis

80
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:17,880
amigos P and this business also entails

81
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,789
a technological part and the feathers

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,669
we've done something that's really

83
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:25,740
important that is then when an order

84
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:30,000
comes to our website this order is

85
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:33,870
linked to the warehouse that gets in

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,360
touch where the delivery people on

87
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:42,740
motorbikes are so it's something that

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,740
works the operator that runs on its own

89
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:52,500
it works automatically so one of the

90
00:05:47,669 --> 00:06:01,590
keys for entrepreneurship is to devote

91
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:04,260
time to it so this something that can we

92
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:08,190
send orders all over the country all

93
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:11,240
over Spain and this use of technology is

94
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:14,580
not just for cybersecurity but also for

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,720
entrepreneurs because one can always

96
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:22,669
think differently out of the box and

97
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,669
give the whole thing a twist

98
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:36,120
and this is well you can see on this

99
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,120
line are different projects different

100
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:43,660
businesses as we can see seem recommend

101
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:50,520
on important data per la camera there's

102
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:53,220
also this company that sells covers for

103
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:58,200
you

104
00:06:53,220 --> 00:07:02,170
machines cameras that is for you

105
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:10,330
computers cell phones so you can cover

106
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:13,000
your camera be able not to be seen so

107
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,820
what I do or 24 IBM I brought you an

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,600
example we do some very nice settings

109
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:22,330
right now we're working in artificial

110
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,420
intelligence and cognitive systems

111
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:29,800
because it's not just interesting to

112
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:38,080
detect a threat but we have some

113
00:07:29,800 --> 00:08:01,120
cognitive tools that go step knowing

114
00:07:38,080 --> 00:08:05,919
that somebody's in your system when you

115
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,260
go into many important banks around the

116
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,320
world there's a solution is the

117
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:14,289
following for instance at the beginning

118
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:17,490
the session says in blue this is what

119
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:20,880
people normally do once

120
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:26,400
you learn how to use the mouse whenever

121
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:29,610
you log in username and and then tab and

122
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,098
then we move the mouse to go to log in

123
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:36,800
log in and the normal thing is to use

124
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:44,580
the blue thing so one of your valid

125
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:49,229
session starts you got a little red tab

126
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:56,910
the abnormal user behavior here we need

127
00:08:49,230 --> 00:09:01,589
to be what's happening and then there's

128
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:04,260
the known first behavior when you go to

129
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:08,670
this a black apart this generates an

130
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:13,980
alert and you're telling banks with 90%

131
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:20,250
of probabilities this user is who he or

132
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:22,560
she says it is some if you do weird

133
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:28,290
things with your mouse a bank may call

134
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:31,410
you and say is that you same thing with

135
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,569
mobile applications everybody has a

136
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:41,040
different way to move your hand every

137
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:44,370
time you click on a key in here we know

138
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,520
whether it's you or not users name

139
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,780
password and for instance you change

140
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,939
hands

141
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:57,550
so these behaviors according to which

142
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,580
you'd tell the bank well this is the

143
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,650
right user so he is the one who is

144
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,110
supposed to be so this is just a little

145
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,540
example and it's not just to do

146
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,490
publicity but just to tell you that's

147
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,199
the whole world uh behind with cognitive

148
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:18,910
fool our tools and there's a whole bunch

149
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,580
of open source online tools for instance

150
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,680
video analyses face recognition there's

151
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,870
a whole bunch of our tools that are very

152
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,260
easy to use with a great potential

153
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:31,240
so what are we concerned with in

154
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,580
cybersecurity this is something that I

155
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:38,110
always tell when I go and see a client

156
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:42,340
this is the next Secretary of Defense of

157
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,980
the US Donald Rumsfeld there are known

158
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,370
knowns as these are things we know that

159
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,350
we know there are known unknowns that is

160
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,339
to say there are things that we don't

161
00:10:50,350 --> 00:11:00,850
know we don't know and there are some

162
00:10:54,339 --> 00:11:04,180
things that I don't know about and this

163
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:09,730
is something that was done or said in a

164
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:18,189
non technological scenario now we speak

165
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:26,170
about cyber war etc but like being like

166
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:28,180
to scare you or anything just to give

167
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,459
you some figures not just to tell you

168
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,030
something and ask you to believe me this

169
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:36,010
is a report we bring every year in IBM

170
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:42,310
every year there are security analyst

171
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:44,710
creatures to research and investigations

172
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,420
but this is research this is these other

173
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,250
types of our threats we've seen in the

174
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:56,069
last few years this is from March 2014

175
00:11:50,250 --> 00:12:00,870
15 16 like green these are access as

176
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:06,940
attacks in yellow as a key well hi

177
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:12,120
attacks and also fishing as you can see

178
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:15,580
there's color that predominant color

179
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:20,880
this is the one 2016

180
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,880
that's everywhere and it says unknown

181
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,190
means that most attacks are gonna be

182
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:33,550
classified so and I think that this is

183
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:36,220
very interesting for those of you who

184
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:39,370
want to work in the area of cyber

185
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:42,450
security this is the right time to do so

186
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:48,940
as curious you see that most of the dots

187
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:51,930
are undisclosed we see that more and

188
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:55,030
more we know less there's more money

189
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:58,270
invested and we realized that we still

190
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:02,260
need to invest much more let's go beyond

191
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:04,630
this these are the attacks when new

192
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:09,540
vulnerability is detected in the last

193
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,540
few years since 2010 in 2010 there were

194
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:24,280
thousands 9,000 now there's about 10,000

195
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:32,349
vulnerabilities or detected such are

196
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:35,199
easy from 2010 to 2016 so before this we

197
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,880
don't know the minister said that there

198
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,340
are things and attacks that are taking

199
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,380
place and that we don't know of that

200
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,560
could be happening right now for

201
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,560
instance

202
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:49,360
cryptid communications whoever knew

203
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,830
about this could be spying on them who

204
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,320
knows 2017 maybe we were being listened

205
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,150
through the mic or maybe they're seeing

206
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,180
it through the cameras and nobody can

207
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:07,329
make sure or ensure tellers that were

208
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:12,180
not being spied on so just to tell you

209
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:12,180
that from the point of view of

210
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:19,810
professional standpoint there's a huge

211
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:24,100
niche some people are saying technology

212
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:27,489
is going to take jobs away from OSHA and

213
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,930
the end is not going to be we won't be

214
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,130
able to find a job I believe that

215
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:38,380
society will keep evolving new work

216
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:43,840
opportunities will come up and we are

217
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:50,320
not taking jobs away from security

218
00:14:43,840 --> 00:15:00,790
analysts people are going to be able to

219
00:14:50,320 --> 00:15:04,660
specialize more like I was saying at the

220
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:07,689
beginning this is an area the main a

221
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:10,209
sector that we love yesterday I was

222
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,610
talking to people and to the winners and

223
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,170
you can tell they enjoy doing what they

224
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:19,330
do I'm sure that when they get home they

225
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:22,300
keep on doing research and investigating

226
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:26,580
this kid you can see here you may say

227
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:29,199
well he doesn't seem to be having a ball

228
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,330
just by looking at the stickers on his

229
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,620
computer I can tell you that he is

230
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:37,510
having a great time maybe he looks tired

231
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:42,310
because he hasn't slept for the last

232
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:44,620
three days because he's been doing

233
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:49,859
something he loves doing so when there

234
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,860
is passion you'll make it I know

235
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:56,019
cause you need to devote time the

236
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:58,238
training is important me you need to go

237
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:03,069
to college you need to have a degree you

238
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:06,339
need vocational training people in high

239
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:09,279
positions analyzing people they want to

240
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:11,769
hire and then privately they tell me I'm

241
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,989
not asking degrees from them

242
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:17,709
I want people will really even know what

243
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:20,679
they do take afine allocated of course

244
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:25,868
training is needed it's true that there

245
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:30,819
are very brilliant people sitting there

246
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:37,649
come very good in cybersecurity and they

247
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:39,969
have opportunities but I always invite I

248
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:43,949
always say that it's important to have

249
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:48,309
something basic degrees something

250
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:49,628
because people don't know you and they

251
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:57,100
need to know that there's something

252
00:16:49,629 --> 00:17:01,539
behind there are so many different

253
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:03,339
profiles you know is something because

254
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:06,459
in the end of the training when you go

255
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:13,059
to a company not just showing that you

256
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:18,009
know started you're interested in what

257
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:21,638
you're doing and really interesting is

258
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:27,299
true that teamwork for instance in

259
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:29,889
Bologna they encouraging teamwork and

260
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:32,289
Ivan an actor please raise your hand

261
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:35,320
who's ever come across this situation

262
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:37,658
you work in a team with ten people

263
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,460
there's always somebody who works very

264
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:42,700
little or doesn't work at all and that

265
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,090
one person is never you is that happen

266
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,559
to you

267
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,899
yes I like to know there's a one

268
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:57,120
is lazy I'd like to interview this a

269
00:17:48,899 --> 00:18:00,029
person and no these are just an Arduino

270
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,219
a second to me is a buddy common PSL

271
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:02,820
many people tell me well okay and how do

272
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,559
I begin

273
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:10,559
how do I get started how do I get to

274
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,330
work for IBM what do I need to do well

275
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,580
the first thing and by the way I'd also

276
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:17,100
like to thank cyber companies

277
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,649
institutions of having invited me here

278
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,949
because these companies these

279
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:24,869
institutions public institutions I think

280
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,389
that it's extremely important for

281
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:29,850
countries not just been it's really

282
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:32,369
important you see that there's a lot of

283
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:35,330
public investment in cyber security not

284
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:39,949
just our security but also technology

285
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,949
the Internet of Things many other things

286
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:47,159
we specialize in something the

287
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:55,740
opportunities there's something I always

288
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:58,950
tell competitions like the one yesterday

289
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:04,529
is very good because areas that allow

290
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,940
you to learn and this is a very complex

291
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:09,590
thing and I'm sure you've thought about

292
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:12,179
this how are we going to train hackers

293
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:15,629
doesn't allow you to hack it's wrong in

294
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:25,320
Spain these people that would play chess

295
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:28,049
since they are little somebody's hacking

296
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:32,629
the police will knock on the door

297
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:32,629
tomorrow so what do we do do we learn

298
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:41,450
these things so CTFs very important you

299
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,449
capture the floor

300
00:19:48,320 --> 00:20:00,379
city s very important thing is the work

301
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,880
all games used them for especially in

302
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,220
English there's a couple in Spanish I

303
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,590
guess and when you be more games these

304
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:12,130
are websites where you have several

305
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:17,389
challenges divided in broken County

306
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:20,840
specialities working so there's a

307
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:23,330
different ten different levels and you

308
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:26,149
one by one the first ones are super

309
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:30,199
super easy and then you keep on

310
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:32,770
advancing and then they start getting

311
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,500
more difficult the good thing is that

312
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:40,510
when you cross a certain level they let

313
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:47,870
you mentor those who come in behind you

314
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:50,180
come after you so collaborative way you

315
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,629
can learn we can train people and I

316
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,280
recommend people to go in here and then

317
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:58,490
finally whatever saying on

318
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:03,700
yeah well mundo say sorry cape I didn't

319
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,700
even sent arrows so people with hackers

320
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:19,220
in Ravello know there's a whole bunch of

321
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:24,200
regulations make it compulsory to hire

322
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:28,790
people jobs in the field of

323
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:31,370
cybersecurity whole bunch of

324
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:34,340
opportunities and we if we specialized

325
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,169
will probably become leaders in ten

326
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:47,870
years

327
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:50,210
so speaking about career plans what am i

328
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:52,729
doing reckoning what am i studying what

329
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:55,649
am i studying this for and one day I

330
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,450
want to see results

331
00:21:55,649 --> 00:22:00,968
companies you can go to your boss and

332
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:05,499
say what's so going on why am I sitting

333
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:09,579
here will end up being head of pen

334
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:11,769
testers or hackers and so let's not

335
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:17,109
waste time doing things so we don't know

336
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:21,009
what we're doing them for to a company

337
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:25,619
and no job and somebody says sit here in

338
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:27,969
the table and do you in five years later

339
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:33,039
you're still there well we need to

340
00:22:27,969 --> 00:22:36,969
complain and and say well I'm doing this

341
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,489
I don't like much why am i gonna spend

342
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:43,299
so much time here why do we do things

343
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:45,609
why do we do the things we do typical

344
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:48,549
interview in an interview where do you

345
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:50,799
see yourself in ten years time I would

346
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:55,029
ask what do you see yourselves in five

347
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:57,700
years time and remember everything that

348
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:59,859
I'm telling you today comes from my

349
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:03,309
personal opinion have been working for

350
00:22:59,859 --> 00:23:05,489
IBM for five years now and I started

351
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:25,178
working the world of cyber security

352
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:28,889
since I was 21 22 and there were 300

353
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,889
people who showed up for the interview

354
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:35,829
so there was this girl sitting to my

355
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:40,299
right I think she came from Russia she

356
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:42,279
spoke like five or six languages her the

357
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:52,299
list of languages she spoke was longer

358
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:54,609
than my entire CV so I thought oh my god

359
00:23:52,299 --> 00:24:00,849
I have nothing to do here I'm totally

360
00:23:54,609 --> 00:24:04,599
lost this is the important part you do

361
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:08,139
have a CV and a vital CV I didn't have

362
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:09,939
work experience but I had worked for

363
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:14,320
no hacker for seven years I had

364
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:17,320
researched I had created Apple apps etc

365
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,540
so that gave proof of the fact that I

366
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,370
wanted to work for that company that I

367
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:24,040
liked what I did and that I had a

368
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:26,290
passion for it and they told me that in

369
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,050
the end that was the reason why they

370
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:31,450
selected me rather than having a lot of

371
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:35,770
decrees and speaking a lot of languages

372
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:41,650
if you like it and you love it they will

373
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:44,290
hire you actually in the world of

374
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:48,070
computing there are a lot of intruders I

375
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:50,040
mean physicians chemistry engineers and

376
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:54,790
many other professionals that are also

377
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:57,220
trying to find a place and a job in our

378
00:24:54,790 --> 00:25:00,610
field anyway when I recommend when you

379
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:04,000
go to a job interview you have to prove

380
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:06,189
that you know the company when they ask

381
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,650
you why this company and not another one

382
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:16,330
you have do you have a clear response

383
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:18,870
well a relative of mine was hired by a

384
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:22,780
company that she didn't know anything of

385
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:27,699
because well she just gave out thousands

386
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:31,120
of CVS and well she found her job the

387
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:34,930
job of her life and she wasn't quite

388
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:39,939
aware of the company she was she was

389
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:43,630
applying for it but don't desperate

390
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:46,120
sometimes you are not hired and not

391
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,740
because you're not good enough maybe the

392
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,550
russian girl who is sitting next to me

393
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:54,190
wasn't hired because she had two degrees

394
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:57,370
in seven languages maybe she was looking

395
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:01,780
for something else and see the example

396
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:05,709
of my relative I mean she just gave away

397
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:09,300
and gave out thousands of CPAs until she

398
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:15,070
found the company where she really fit

399
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:18,340
so this is what happens in the end

400
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:21,220
an IBM and in the world in general there

401
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:23,260
are people who get paid and they are

402
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,190
angry and the world they're just sitting

403
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:29,590
at their desk watching the time go by

404
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:31,240
and they do much about it

405
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:33,310
so I think during the interview we have

406
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,140
to give proof that we know the company

407
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:37,050
then we can add value to the company

408
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:40,300
we're not going to be just one more

409
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:42,190
sitting there we have a CV and we are

410
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,700
different innovation and disruptive

411
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,530
thinking is what companies are currently

412
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:51,460
demanding young people now are listened

413
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:53,740
to of the companies I had the luck of

414
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:58,240
being a trainee and I didn't have to

415
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:59,710
copy anything or do paperwork because

416
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,750
they were interested in me they were

417
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,940
interested in my opinion they are

418
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,580
interested in the technology Bri that is

419
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:09,880
coming and not just in the field of

420
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:14,429
video games when it comes to computer

421
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:18,340
security where can we work well I have

422
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:21,190
split it like this first consultancy

423
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:23,110
this part is a little bit apart from it

424
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:26,680
because I like to tell or make a

425
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:28,770
difference between the commercial world

426
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,920
and the technical world in terms of

427
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:36,730
consultancy there are many issues

428
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:42,430
regarding cyber security if you go to

429
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:45,310
the checklist standardization etc as

430
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:47,800
some people like this world people who

431
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:50,590
are highly technical are not so fond of

432
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,620
it but there is also the option of

433
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:57,310
technical consultancy some clients

434
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:59,110
actually asked me to help them because

435
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:01,270
they've bought very expensive software

436
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:04,179
item they don't know how to do with it

437
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:07,090
so we help them make things work that is

438
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,640
a nice job as well it is very rewarding

439
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,100
because the client is very satisfied

440
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,260
that someone who knows about this is

441
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,719
able to help them so being a

442
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:20,200
troubleshooter is also important and

443
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,660
interesting then technical world

444
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,090
technical sphere and commercial sphere

445
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,919
in the technical sphere there are many

446
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:30,879
job opportunities are

447
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:32,559
sitio iBM is a technician a practitioner

448
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:36,699
she started programming as everybody

449
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:39,039
else then I I will talk a little bit

450
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,279
more about the commercial side but maybe

451
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:46,690
there is a way of combining those the

452
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:48,519
technical world is the one that is

453
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,399
providing value to the company because

454
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,559
it's you actually who are who is

455
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:57,309
performing the ethical hacking for

456
00:28:53,559 --> 00:29:00,549
example but you need a commercial part

457
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:03,940
in the entire operation in some

458
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:06,519
countries people from the commercial

459
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:07,269
departments get higher salaries and vice

460
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,909
versa

461
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:14,350
that depends on the country so you have

462
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:16,779
to think about what is more important

463
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:19,029
someone who knows about how to do things

464
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:22,480
or someone who knows about how to sell

465
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:25,389
things we will discuss it more at the

466
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,190
end now a question you have to ask

467
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,269
yourself is what happens if you are

468
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:32,109
fired at tomorrow

469
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:34,299
are you irreplaceable am I the only

470
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:40,749
person who knows the passwords Forex

471
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:42,908
people companies avoid this more and

472
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:45,369
more they cannot have the company

473
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:51,690
paralyzed if the only person who knows

474
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:54,428
the passwords falls ill for example a

475
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:58,179
great problem for the company that's why

476
00:29:54,429 --> 00:30:01,739
they prevent this kind of situations of

477
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:04,539
course specialization is very important

478
00:30:01,739 --> 00:30:08,049
but be careful because being too

479
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:10,269
specialized is sometimes dangerous if

480
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:12,549
you want to be the best hacker in the

481
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:14,320
world hacker but not a cyber criminal

482
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:17,019
let's underline this so if you want to

483
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,350
be the best hacker in the world you have

484
00:30:17,019 --> 00:30:25,899
to spend your whole life doing intrusion

485
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:29,109
test but there are many different and

486
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:32,109
cool pen tests here we have people

487
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:34,299
specialized in networks in Wi-Fi

488
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:36,699
networks people who are ultra

489
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:38,800
specialized because they love what they

490
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:42,730
do and what they do is

491
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:45,190
spectacular but be careful because if

492
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,660
you are too specialized in one

493
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:50,350
department in the company you will never

494
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:52,180
be promoted or changed or you won't have

495
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:55,270
any different job opportunities that's

496
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:57,550
something you have to consider so as I

497
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,639
was saying what is more important being

498
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:04,300
a practitioner or being a seller sales

499
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,390
rep well in the technical part we have

500
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,850
the product development the development

501
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:12,700
of existing products to adapt them to

502
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:17,050
clients needs then there is also a part

503
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:19,240
of investigation at Google HP IBM etc we

504
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,899
have research centers in San Francisco

505
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:28,870
San Jose New York Switzerland there are

506
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:34,560
many places you can work so there are

507
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:38,800
many cool places you can go and develop

508
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:42,220
and research research teams are really

509
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:45,909
fun teams they were jeans to work they

510
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:49,270
have a lot of fun at work they it says

511
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:53,880
while they are working and if you take a

512
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:56,410
closer look at the IBM research team on

513
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,520
LinkedIn they don't have the real names

514
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:04,120
they have their hacker nicknames so it's

515
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:06,580
interesting they know a lot of things

516
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,489
and they add a lot of value to the

517
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:13,179
company then the integration if you are

518
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:16,120
in the technical field you can integrate

519
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,970
already bought end products for example

520
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,100
as I was saying before some clients

521
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:24,520
don't know how to use a software they

522
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:29,110
are interested in having so we make

523
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:33,330
things work and we put that into to be

524
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:37,330
up and running and then we have the

525
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:39,669
services professional services that is

526
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:43,530
bring me somebody tomorrow who can

527
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:47,530
perform a pen test in my company this is

528
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:49,510
the value that is provided by somebody

529
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:52,690
and somebody's knowledge rather than a

530
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:56,500
product well on the other hand we have

531
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:59,800
these sales worlds and it's all about

532
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:03,760
selling of course it's interesting as

533
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,250
well because it is measurable it's

534
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,060
interesting to ask this to your boss how

535
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:14,860
do you measure me how do I know what my

536
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:17,200
goals are what are my milestones what

537
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:21,969
goals do I need to achieve in order to

538
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:25,630
be promoted this is difficult in the

539
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:28,120
technical field but it's very easy in

540
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,410
the sales world if you need to sell a

541
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,659
hundred and you sell a hundred and

542
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:36,040
twenty you are uploaded and you only

543
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:39,520
sell 30 you are fired so they say there

544
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:44,379
are more career options in sales because

545
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,510
it's a very measurable area so what

546
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,520
happens if I'm not sure about what to do

547
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:51,310
well thanks to all these new

548
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:55,030
opportunities are coming up there is a

549
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:57,909
little bit of everything and here's when

550
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,560
we come to these new profiles for

551
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:03,400
example pre-sales

552
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:06,940
you can be a sales rep and a technician

553
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,850
as well here you may have a fixed salary

554
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,450
and then a varietal salary depending on

555
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:18,880
the amount you sell this is interesting

556
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:22,060
because there are many practitioners who

557
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:24,450
have a varietal salary and they have to

558
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:28,630
go to the clients and sell them things

559
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:32,199
then there is this very new position

560
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:34,240
this very new job called CSM and I

561
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,168
encouraged you to know more about it

562
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,020
because there are more and more

563
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:43,270
opportunities and this is called client

564
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:50,199
success manager it sounds a little bit

565
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:52,830
like nothing really important but it is

566
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:56,189
indeed have you ever heard of yes

567
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:59,930
IAS cell software as a service

568
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:02,400
this is a sales option where clients

569
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:06,299
software-as-a-service so instead of

570
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,460
buying a big equipment they pay you a

571
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,580
rent because they don't want to make

572
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:16,070
that upfront investment so they rent it

573
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,069
from you and you just provide a service

574
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:25,260
for example the company connects to our

575
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:29,430
sock and we notify the clients whenever

576
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:33,930
there's an alert so this SaaS thing is

577
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:36,330
very important and so is c sm c sm is

578
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,370
the manager that makes sure that the

579
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:41,940
client doesn't leave at the end of the

580
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:45,330
month because saas it is interesting but

581
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:48,240
it is a bit tricky because at the end of

582
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:51,720
the agreed period clients may just go

583
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,350
away and leave you don't have to go to

584
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:59,549
their place and get the equipment back

585
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:01,080
to your office etc in this case i don't

586
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:05,550
have to do anything like that they just

587
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:10,350
have to click a button so this is when

588
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:12,780
this profile comes into play this is

589
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:17,580
somebody with the technical profile but

590
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:21,360
who goes to the client and asked the

591
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:28,680
client why they want to leave they ask

592
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:30,870
about what their needs are and the

593
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,390
salesman this rep needs to be

594
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:36,509
specialized because if the client starts

595
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:39,270
asking technical questions they want to

596
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,190
be able to answer them CSM is a very

597
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,950
nice position is a very interesting

598
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:47,580
position because it combines sales and

599
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:49,830
development so if you are a CSM you

600
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:53,880
become a bridge between the client and

601
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:59,250
the developers for example if your

602
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:01,710
machines are in Israel if the clients

603
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:04,029
machines are in Israel you can tell the

604
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:07,220
developers

605
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:13,490
to change the parameters say that the

606
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:15,680
customer receives a pop-up box if you're

607
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:21,288
interested in a certain things to come

608
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,089
up with so I encourage you to to learn

609
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:26,359
more about this position and of course

610
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:28,549
the city oh I mean why not the chief

611
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:32,509
technology officer is the highest

612
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:34,819
position in the technology field and now

613
00:37:32,509 --> 00:37:38,329
it's very interesting to decide where a

614
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:41,150
company is going in terms of technology

615
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:43,250
so this is the role the profile there's

616
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:46,849
guy reading the paper with the moustache

617
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:50,779
so this is how I started I started with

618
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:55,369
the development research integration and

619
00:37:50,779 --> 00:38:02,480
service and then I worked as a CSM for

620
00:37:55,369 --> 00:38:06,440
some time now I do all the time every

621
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:11,269
time I go to a customer I just told them

622
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:13,160
about what their vulnerabilities are and

623
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:15,109
I told them well if I were a hacker

624
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:19,399
I would attack you here and here so

625
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:21,380
that's how I can actively send them I

626
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:28,640
sell them products that may be

627
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:31,250
interesting for them so let's assume we

628
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,720
are at work now and here we face a lot

629
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:37,339
of dilemmas a lot of people work at

630
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:43,339
companies and they don't know what that

631
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:45,500
means what that in for example there are

632
00:38:43,339 --> 00:38:51,500
many multinational corporations such as

633
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:54,859
IBM that give you a lot of money every

634
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:57,950
year to receive training in whatever

635
00:38:54,859 --> 00:39:01,430
field you want 3d animations go ahead

636
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:05,919
for it these are very good benefits that

637
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:09,078
large corporations provide you this is

638
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,940
something that you need to ask for

639
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:13,099
example this is very common in

640
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,599
California in California this is the

641
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:16,770
other way around

642
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,620
if you go to California they

643
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:22,080
you come to my company because I'm going

644
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,420
to pay social insurance dentistry

645
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:28,049
insurance I'm going to invite you to

646
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:32,490
many events they have very different and

647
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:34,980
very many benefits for you and this is a

648
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:37,560
different mentality in California

649
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,380
coaching also in many large corporations

650
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:44,070
you can get a coach if you ask for one

651
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:47,970
at IBM for example we have technical

652
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:49,920
coaches and career coaches the first one

653
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:52,799
is someone you meet whenever you want

654
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,430
once a month or once every two weeks etc

655
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,940
and the one is about asking okay I want

656
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:03,359
to know more about IPS or about security

657
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,580
ticketing tools ever so there's

658
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,740
technical coach tells you what I've been

659
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:10,440
doing this for 30 years and this is how

660
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:14,250
you have to do it you meet with that

661
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,650
person that person takes care that you

662
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:19,290
learn more about that and they always

663
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:21,720
recommend that it is someone from a

664
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:26,240
different department than the one you

665
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:29,250
work and your boss cannot be your coach

666
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,250
because the car which is going to tell

667
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:34,260
you tell your boss it is time that you

668
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:38,460
promote or it's time that you get a pay

669
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:40,860
rise so the coach the the higher

670
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:44,190
position he or she has the better

671
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:48,660
because this person has a broader vision

672
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:51,900
of the company if it is the CEO for

673
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,580
example you can understand the pathway

674
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:58,890
that person followed in order to become

675
00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:01,410
a city--a so it is very interesting this

676
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:03,600
is from my own experience when you're

677
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:07,799
talking to people who are at the very

678
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:11,430
top or who are close to retiring

679
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,430
they are usually nicer to you and they

680
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:17,069
are very eager to help youngsters so

681
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:18,629
don't hesitate to go to them and ask

682
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,610
them I want to be with you in the future

683
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:23,510
what do you have to do

684
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:26,630
then mentality and challenges there are

685
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:30,950
many in vase this is something that

686
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:33,530
needs to come from you you need to learn

687
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:36,009
all the time if you spent one or two

688
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:38,660
months without looking at Twitter or

689
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:40,280
keeping yourself updated there are

690
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,589
thousands of new products and

691
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,690
vulnerabilities every day therefore you

692
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:49,010
need to keep updated all the time and do

693
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:52,010
different things regarding events and

694
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:55,400
communities there are many events like

695
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:58,910
this one communities such as mundo haka

696
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:03,110
there are many options that I encourage

697
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:04,899
you to attend and the last part I would

698
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:08,510
like to tell you about is the

699
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,820
Entrepreneurship I'm going to tell you

700
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,550
about stuff that has happened to me in

701
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,500
my seven years as an entrepreneur and

702
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:19,520
things I would have liked to know when I

703
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,480
started first of all it is good to have

704
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,610
an idea

705
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,220
and develop it when you're at home and

706
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:27,440
you realize you have a good idea and you

707
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:32,060
want to develop that's great but you

708
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:35,510
need to set milestones and set fun dates

709
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:38,840
because I've seen people who've spent 10

710
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:41,300
years programming at tool well maybe the

711
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,890
tool is out of date or maybe it's time

712
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,760
to do something else and they go well

713
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:48,379
yeah maybe you're right because yeah now

714
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,230
it's time to do something different

715
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:55,520
because 10 years after that tool is not

716
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:59,630
going to be as as interesting as it was

717
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:06,140
10 years ago this is the the the case of

718
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:09,380
a friend of mine who started seven years

719
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,500
ago and who didn't realize that websites

720
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:15,680
were totally different now he knows that

721
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:19,040
he won't be able to sell his solution in

722
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:23,089
20 years time so be an entrepreneur that

723
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:26,680
is great but do it sensibly and set

724
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:30,200
yourselves short and midterm objectives

725
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:32,589
and now what if somebody else has the

726
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:37,160
same idea

727
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:40,790
and the former slides or or one of the

728
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,620
first slides gave you an idea of the

729
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,720
very many different things I have done

730
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:54,319
why because people have come to me

731
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:57,500
asking for help because instead spending

732
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:02,450
thousands of euros in creating a website

733
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:06,380
for you well instead of getting a

734
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:08,359
payment and getting paid for creating

735
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:16,580
and developing your entire website maybe

736
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:18,290
I can take in your company because there

737
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:25,700
are many ways of adding this

738
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:27,740
technological value to companies so you

739
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:29,660
may participate in a company in many

740
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:32,290
different ways for example I can create

741
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:35,960
your website and everything you sail I

742
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:39,080
take care of it so if somebody doesn't

743
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,900
have enough money to pay you to develop

744
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:44,690
an entire website well you can get a

745
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:47,270
share for every item they sell for

746
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:52,160
example 2% or something like that this

747
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:54,560
is but there are thousands of ideas that

748
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,740
you can use in order to participate in a

749
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,270
company what's important here well you

750
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:03,080
have to know that a company is like a

751
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,120
marriage legally speaking you sign the

752
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:11,529
paper

753
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:14,120
you have liability towards one another

754
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:16,900
and this is very important and I'm going

755
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:19,279
to tell you story in one of the

756
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,390
companies I used to have I'm not telling

757
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,750
you the name

758
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:28,279
we were several partners and someone

759
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:29,840
said ok we buy your company for this

760
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,790
amount of money well we said we don't

761
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,070
want to because this was like our baby

762
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:37,310
we don't want to get rid of it but one

763
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:41,600
of the partners said well I do want to

764
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:44,560
sell it so here's where the problem

765
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,560
starts

766
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:52,349
well according to the legal terms of

767
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:56,940
this is devided a continent to the

768
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:59,070
shares the percentage and at the end of

769
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:02,010
the day this is very sad in our case our

770
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:06,150
our fifth partner just vanished

771
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:08,640
disappeared if you leave the company and

772
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:11,820
you have a share of that company you

773
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:19,799
need to sign at the end of every month

774
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:22,470
and at the end of every quarter so we

775
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:26,010
had a lot of problems because this guy

776
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:31,589
leave or left and we couldn't afford him

777
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:34,140
leaving so well we went looking for him

778
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:38,609
we had a lot of drinks together trying

779
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:43,020
to convince him to convince him to sell

780
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:45,569
the shares to ask to the other partners

781
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:48,750
rather than disappearing because the

782
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:51,599
company's paralyzed if you leave if we

783
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:54,150
had signed a partner's agreement this

784
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,790
wouldn't have happened actually this guy

785
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,069
came back to the company and he is now

786
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:01,680
very happy working with us again that's

787
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:04,680
why I'm not saying the name but having

788
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,960
this partner's agreement is very

789
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:10,109
interesting because you define all the

790
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,420
conditions I know a guy who signed this

791
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:15,450
agreement this partner agreement with

792
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,660
his two sisters it was actually their

793
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:20,790
father who made them do it

794
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,828
why because you never know what can

795
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:25,140
happen

796
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:27,329
we start with 3,000 euros but what

797
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:31,140
happens if it's three million euros in

798
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:33,900
10 years time because when there is

799
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:36,118
money at stake there are always problems

800
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,270
and fall involved so you have to think

801
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,369
big in that Partners agreement you set

802
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:45,210
the conditions for example if you want

803
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:48,710
to go for a capital increase if I

804
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:51,690
provided 1000 euros but you provided or

805
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:56,579
100,000 that capital increase needs to

806
00:47:51,690 --> 00:48:00,839
be proportional oh wise you're totally

807
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:03,959
in trouble if that is already set in the

808
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:06,630
partners agreement you are protected you

809
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:09,089
can set the conditions like you cannot

810
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:12,630
increase the capital by more than this

811
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:16,589
amount or capital increase cannot take

812
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:19,829
place if at least three partners don't

813
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:21,719
agree and many other conditions that you

814
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:24,239
can set I'm not telling you to do this

815
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:26,880
yourself there are lawyers who do that

816
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:31,259
so you can draft this kind of Partners

817
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:34,529
agreement which is maybe 15 or 20 pages

818
00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:38,459
long because this is what we're going to

819
00:48:34,529 --> 00:48:41,429
find at the end of the day we can sit at

820
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:43,169
our desk and wonder what are we doing

821
00:48:41,429 --> 00:48:46,410
what are we going to do tomorrow what am

822
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:48,390
I going to do with my free time well

823
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:53,578
there are many interesting things that

824
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:57,660
have shown to you think outside the box

825
00:48:53,579 --> 00:49:00,959
offer your company that disruptive

826
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:05,399
thinking saying can I visit this client

827
00:49:00,959 --> 00:49:08,459
and prove them that I can hack them well

828
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,729
the company said yes and I got promoted

829
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:13,948
like that but if it didn't come from me

830
00:49:11,729 --> 00:49:17,129
if that idea hadn't come from me I

831
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:20,249
wouldn't have gone this far because if I

832
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:22,769
had stayed all the time in my cave

833
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:26,339
working on my computer I would have

834
00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:29,689
probably I wouldn't have been promoted

835
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:33,179
probably so I've told you about

836
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:37,979
technical profiles about sales profiles

837
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:41,009
and many more opportunities pen tests

838
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:45,328
are great but if you cannot explain the

839
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:48,469
customer why it is important to perform

840
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:51,739
those pen tests they won't buy them it's

841
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:55,679
important therefore to promote that

842
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:57,119
commercial side we have to think big

843
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:00,769
thick different we have a lot of

844
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:04,279
opportunities IOT the Internet of Things

845
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:10,118
cybersecurity many things

846
00:50:04,279 --> 00:50:15,289
so I invite you to reflect think ahead

847
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:18,769
and I hope my advice is useful so I'll

848
00:50:15,289 --> 00:50:21,140
be happy to answer any questions you may

849
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:23,979
have it was my pleasure to be here M I

850
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,980
will be around

851

you
