1
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,270
retaining as possible so we can go out

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:27,770
for a lot my name is Mario Santi that

3
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:31,680
come from Mexico City from very far away

4
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,900
it's been quite a long flight and I'm

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,440
here to talk to you about a tool that

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,320
has existed for a decade but for many

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,870
people it's still unknown I'm referring

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,150
to the blue window that few people

9
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:54,530
referred to as PowerShell I hold a

10
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:56,510
degree in computer science and I have

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,940
experienced an incident response

12
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:08,340
penetration testing and I currently work

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:13,650
in debugging and this is a disclaimer we

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:16,950
have some slice I've brought ten slides

15
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:22,820
for some demos and this presentation has

16
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:25,229
been prepared solely for informational

17
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:29,788
informative and educational purposes

18
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:34,560
foodist powershell powershell and here

19
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:39,109
we have microsoft's definition they're

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,509
going to do this it's an environment for

21
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:46,469
scripting language development and the

22
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:49,170
main advantage of PowerShell is that we

23
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:54,619
use objects instead of text which is

24
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:59,960
what CMD your vest does with Linux

25
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:03,689
why PowerShell here we have some

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,240
references pablo home sally author of

27
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,209
these two books that you can see that

28
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,569
are wonderful there are very few

29
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:15,630
references in spanish huang garrido has

30
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,690
done amazing research in this field and

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,380
carlos spirit

32
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:27,480
who works and Metasploit and has

33
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:33,200
contributed to powershell pusher mode

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:35,310
and powershell mediated MSH

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,319
implementation he has done something

36
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,510
amazing he has contributed very

37
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,339
significantly to this world to talk

38
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:45,239
about the PowerShell let me give you the

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,180
context we have set of components we

40
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,019
have the shell command prompt which is

41
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:57,540
the blue window then most of you have

42
00:02:52,019 --> 00:03:00,720
seen then we have the commander's then

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,179
we have the providers that are command

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,150
lists that are specific to work with

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,519
specific data with which we wouldn't be

46
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:11,850
able to work with the command line an

47
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,090
example is the Windows registry then we

48
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,890
have the help for the system or from the

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:22,799
command le'ts and I'll show you soon a

50
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,768
small demo of how powerful this is and

51
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:29,280
then we have the modules to broaden and

52
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,920
extend some PowerShell functionalities

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:37,590
there are many modules developed by the

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:41,820
community active directory that is owned

55
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:46,640
by Microsoft the one developed by Carlos

56
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,640
beta as I was saying etc

57
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:55,010
first of all I like to link up our shell

58
00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:00,400
with penetration testing we have some

59
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,399
tools and I'm going to show them to you

60
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:10,330
some projects that are specific for

61
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:13,970
penetration testing we have power cut

62
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:16,940
which is a net cut implemented with

63
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,988
power shell we also have some other

64
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:25,730
projects like 14 mod when I mentioned

65
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:31,700
earlier developed by Commerce fitted and

66
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:39,140
so wonderful we have power exploit as

67
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:42,860
well my year this tool was developed by

68
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:46,640
Hungary know to conduct

69
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:49,490
Active Directory auditors wonderful you

70
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:55,039
just need to execute it and it issues an

71
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,660
automated report of n things it's a

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,669
wonderful and I'm going to give you some

73
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,160
examples so that you understand the

74
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:04,390
application of these tools all right

75
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,390
over there's quite a fast

76
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:18,630
[Music]

77
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:54,669
here are the tools I mentioned power cut

78
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:54,669
is the first one I'm going to show you

79
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:07,550
I forgot to say that this is common

80
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,400
plant which is often known as the blue

81
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,670
window and we also have the development

82
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,760
environment provided by and Microsoft

83
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,490
it's a script development environment

84
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,390
with many features we have the editor we

85
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,670
have the console and description of all

86
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:31,640
the commandments available divided in

87
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:35,050
two categories and do a demo for you

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,050
we're using power cut

89
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:55,580
as you can see it's developed here and

90
00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:01,609
of course I don't have time to explain

91
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:01,609
code to you so I don't have much time

92
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:16,860
just run it you executed this is similar

93
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:20,188
to net cut to check that it's open

94
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,800
verify that it's open we're going to do

95
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:27,479
something very fast and we can verify

96
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:32,009
that we can have more ports open for

97
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:35,460
this tool and for example this port is

98
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:37,469
open we can select that it for you wish

99
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,258
this is just a demo so that you

100
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:42,870
understand how these tools work so that

101
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:45,900
you can use them for pen testing or

102
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:52,940
penetration testing purposes for

103
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:55,919
forensic computing purposes as well and

104
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:59,940
when we talk about power shelf in a more

105
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:02,430
advanced manner there are other tools

106
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,669
worth mentioning PowerShell allows you

107
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:08,039
to include or handle the dotnet

108
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:11,159
framework without having to open visual

109
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:16,680
studio we can create a bit window forms

110
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:21,659
we can sit or paste api's voice api's or

111
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:25,139
can we can work directly with objects we

112
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:28,440
can create from powershell Microsoft

113
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:32,698
Word or Excel spreadsheet personalized

114
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,309
customized parts let me show you an

115
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:41,718
example so that you understand how we

116
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:45,180
can create this without having to open

117
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,060
visual studio this is a very simple

118
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:50,870
example for example how to create a

119
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:56,660
condor very very simple

120
00:08:50,870 --> 00:09:04,000
with these lines of code we can also

121
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:04,000
create well here I have some examples

122
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,579
[Music]

123
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,549
[Music]

124
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,490
but just like to show you some examples

125
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,880
of what we can do

126
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:41,199
[Music]

127
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,199
with PowerShell

128
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,270
you don't have to set up visual studio

129
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:55,820
that consumes any resources

130
00:09:50,270 --> 00:10:00,260
no you cannot create small projects that

131
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:06,470
can do amazing stuff okay an example

132
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:09,260
with a voice API that is included with

133
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:11,690
Windows you're creating a feature of

134
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:18,189
functionality we are creating an object

135
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:23,230
using the API the voice operating system

136
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:23,230
we just run it which is executed

137
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,910
I don't have audio I believe and this

138
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,910
laptop

139
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:52,430
unfortunately I can't activate the audio

140
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:57,769
but we can play around with lots of

141
00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:00,310
elements we can send text file thousands

142
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:05,029
of things in the program software

143
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:10,719
automatically reads my voice what we are

144
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:14,329
sending or transferring another example

145
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:22,550
I'm gonna rush here let me choose this

146
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:27,050
other example we conduct audits audits

147
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:30,170
on systems were interested in being able

148
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:33,019
to use different techniques like google

149
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:36,229
hacking to be able to identify self to

150
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:38,839
me there are n techniques to the first

151
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:42,649
subdomains this is an example I prepared

152
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:47,870
and the only thing we do is send Google

153
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:52,040
a request using a google hacking and

154
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:56,900
ring hacking as well

155
00:11:52,040 --> 00:12:00,079
let's check something from here from

156
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:03,020
Spain for the bank not doing anything at

157
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:07,400
this stage and what I'm going to do is

158
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:09,230
conduct a search in Google regarding

159
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,060
everything related to this and there are

160
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:17,980
some filters in place

161
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:22,310
I haven't fine-tuned it 100%

162
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:28,340
these are subdomains we have and that

163
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:32,569
can be useful in order to be able to

164
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:36,380
penetrate visa subdomains a more

165
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:40,850
customer there are some implementations

166
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:44,390
that are also quite interesting there's

167
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,640
this sufferer that was presented in

168
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,580
black half-assed some years ago by Jaco

169
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,750
water a kid I called answered he

170
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:58,370
developed it in Python I tried to

171
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:01,460
transfer to PowerShell some things were

172
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:04,340
lost I was able to hone some other

173
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,230
things and search for those of you and

174
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,680
aware with this is a tool that allows us

175
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,500
to work within map

176
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:17,050
and in a very simple manner and allows

177
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:22,120
us to search scripts she examined the

178
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:25,069
documentation pertaining to each script

179
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,700
we've often wanted to look for scripts

180
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,310
that we own and we have to access the

181
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,029
folder then the script folder to be more

182
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:37,520
exact and try to see whether it's there

183
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:40,820
here what we do is conduct a search and

184
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,660
we conduct a search by ICP for example

185
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:49,660
so in a very simple way we can see all

186
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:59,270
the scripts we have we can search for

187
00:13:49,660 --> 00:14:03,430
well based on name or by category you

188
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:06,709
don't need to know more degrees just

189
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:10,219
select them among the list and you can

190
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:14,150
look for all the exploits in Mack

191
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:22,070
and we currently have one in this

192
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:32,900
specific case and we can also do an

193
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:35,420
author based search and this is one of

194
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,640
the main contributors Paulino Cali Donna

195
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:40,400
also Mexican like myself friends

196
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,630
he has many different developments one

197
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:47,900
of the most important ones was to detect

198
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:51,010
the eternal blue vulnerability and here

199
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:56,110
we have all the scripts he has developed

200
00:14:51,010 --> 00:15:02,600
here with of m/s 17 all 10 vulnerability

201
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:06,590
we can also get the documentation just

202
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:13,030
using talk the name of the script and

203
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:13,030
here we have all the scripts available

204
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:22,130
we can just self complete and here we

205
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:28,820
have the script documentation in a very

206
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:31,250
simple way the idea is I believe Kokubo

207
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:35,840
the bacharach is from Colombia from

208
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:40,310
Dragon huggable community this is his

209
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,490
total the idea of Power Cell is not to

210
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:48,109
install anything in order to make any

211
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:51,590
sort of operation to use n search you

212
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:54,889
need Python and some others but here you

213
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:57,769
just need to execute the script

214
00:15:54,889 --> 00:16:00,079
and as simple as this you get the

215
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:02,959
documentation is something very simple

216
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,748
but don't many occasions we'll look for

217
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,149
something like this in Internet and many

218
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:11,239
of us do not know that this information

219
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:14,540
is inside the script is always updated

220
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:24,279
and we have a command to update it to

221
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:27,949
the latest releases and we can also do

222
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:30,980
administration rules either updates the

223
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:34,878
databases downloading the scripts have

224
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:39,199
until the last date we have the

225
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,970
documentation and updated information

226
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,769
that we can execute this is a clear

227
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:45,470
example of everything that can be

228
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:48,169
carried out with Power Cell the idea is

229
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,319
not to install anything in the earth in

230
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:55,569
order to do our test we have n map and

231
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:59,089
as you know you don't need to install it

232
00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:04,519
you can just download it and execute it

233
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:10,429
and from here this is all you can do we

234
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:15,319
just have to exit and we continue where

235
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:20,510
we were I would also like to introduce

236
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:23,550
you the work with Microsoft your office

237
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:30,090
this is a small script

238
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:35,419
to check the hardening on OS generating

239
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,419
a text file that generates a report or

240
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:46,530
that automatically generates a word file

241
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:54,449
with the help of dot-com objects what we

242
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:57,180
do is just execute it we're gonna do it

243
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,610
in the local observer we can do it in

244
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:02,130
remote powers and give us the

245
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,969
possibility to execute commands remotely

246
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:08,870
using in our M technologies but now

247
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:14,150
we're gonna do it with a local server

248
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:22,659
we're going to execute it and here is

249
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:27,720
when we see what we have

250
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:31,309
over always as I said this

251
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:35,789
is not only possible locally but also

252
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:42,710
remotely and as you can see these

253
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:48,539
Microsoft Word file is not built by me

254
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:53,460
but automatically and is Gerren out the

255
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:58,650
hardening of the equipment always it

256
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:05,539
will take some time and I've shown of

257
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:10,950
also Sonia I do buy aspirin for Europe

258
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:13,740
working in a similar way than the last

259
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:17,309
script but is integrated in this case

260
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:21,809
through Active Directory it gets a level

261
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:24,990
of hardening with a report one in Excel

262
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:28,379
and the other one in world and this can

263
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:31,320
save so much time in the daily opera tea

264
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,289
operations just to mention some of the

265
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,950
functionalities but we have some more

266
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:43,679
there are some tools developed by

267
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:48,090
different partners that helped us in the

268
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:54,210
incident response part one of the

269
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:59,610
best-known is PS reckon that helped us

270
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:04,289
through powers LT activated their script

271
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:06,178
takes some time to execute it we can

272
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:08,780
also do it remotely

273
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:12,360
due to time reasons I executed in my

274
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:19,960
device that you can see it now

275
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:26,740
it builds an html5 providing information

276
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:30,850
about that system this is very useful in

277
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:33,340
incident response cases as you know we

278
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:36,370
have to do things as fast as possible

279
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:40,090
and we have a great deal of information

280
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:43,529
here in a nice-looking report all of

281
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,529
these using Power Cell

282
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:56,070
we have fire world settings and many

283
00:20:50,160 --> 00:21:00,530
things as you can see there are many

284
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,530
different possibilities

285
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:14,229
in an HTML file as you can see the word

286
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:16,269
that I left on a few seconds ago it

287
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:21,820
validates different contents in

288
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:30,039
different folders and we see all the

289
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:34,299
information that is comes from the sea I

290
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:36,970
ask that this script checks in side a

291
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:41,229
device creating a word here and

292
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:47,769
everything is simple as you can see to

293
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:49,899
be able to provide a report is not only

294
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:53,649
once you can lunch

295
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:56,469
a number of times and make all the

296
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:59,379
process automatic of course they can

297
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:05,470
talk on the resources available I've

298
00:21:59,379 --> 00:22:10,269
tested it with large number of devices

299
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:12,609
and it gets or need so many resources

300
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:19,389
those are a few examples I can give you

301
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:23,799
and now we're going to see some other we

302
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:27,789
have in the intent response modules or

303
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:31,479
in tools available there is one named

304
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:35,470
concern it was developed by a Hindu I

305
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:39,399
don't remember his name and this is the

306
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:45,190
same as Pierce freaking but with this we

307
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:47,939
can get functionalities isolated for

308
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,940
example memory

309
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,980
or certain things that are already

310
00:22:50,820 --> 00:23:00,509
present in PS Rican and here we can

311
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:05,549
import it to an excel file using some

312
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:13,230
power shell command let's we also have

313
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:15,899
nishang go for penetration testing for

314
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,720
everything related to penetration

315
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:21,268
testing from getting information

316
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,450
exploitation analysis we have many many

317
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:28,289
different scripts that allow us to do

318
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:30,990
many things for example to check whether

319
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:34,440
receive into our machine we can use

320
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,360
mimic at we have a small key lever it

321
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,419
doesn't work too well we have a get

322
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,928
information that brings all the

323
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:45,080
information from the OS and many other

324
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:45,080
things

325
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:54,380
and other great Julius was a mod he can

326
00:23:51,559 --> 00:24:02,720
be imported as a module with all its

327
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:06,039
functionalities or we can use part of

328
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:12,159
the tools I'm going to show you a small

329
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:18,610
demonstration of one of the

330
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:24,529
functionalities do we have power memory

331
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:27,289
yes we have power memory this is an

332
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:30,200
implementation from mimic odds as you

333
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:33,289
know and the malware antivirus they have

334
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,590
the signature when we're doing a

335
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:39,350
penetration testing process in Macca's

336
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:41,629
we have to verify whether there is any

337
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,469
sort of antivirus or anti-malware the

338
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:47,630
majority we can check it with virustotal

339
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:50,409
but those implementation in power cell

340
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:54,500
by mimic arts using the same procedure

341
00:24:50,409 --> 00:25:02,120
it interrupts the process the l has

342
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:05,179
asked and gets the credentials here

343
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:11,320
we're gonna do a small demo of how it

344
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:17,350
works as I said

345
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:20,200
at present I in my experience I haven't

346
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,449
seen anything that can detect it even

347
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:27,990
though there are different and the

348
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,990
malware that detect this type of scripts

349
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:39,640
we have many anti-malware that they

350
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:47,520
claim that they can do it but they don't

351
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:47,520
at least they don't do it yet I'm gonna

352
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:59,620
show you an example we have the same

353
00:25:51,610 --> 00:26:06,159
problems to execute mimic odds we should

354
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:12,989
have an administration rights we cannot

355
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,990
execute them without the permit

356
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:20,089
[Music]

357
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:29,380
aqui tenemos la illaha Boop y know a lot

358
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:34,920
about punta pacifica we have the ps1

359
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,920
file we're going to execute it and the

360
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:43,270
only thing is to execute it and here we

361
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:51,730
have different possibilities let us do

362
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:54,639
it in really fast way so we're going to

363
00:26:51,730 --> 00:27:00,840
do it a local server we have the

364
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:03,970
possibility to do it remotely with as as

365
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:09,610
available and different possibilities as

366
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:14,710
you can see let's do it locally and this

367
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:20,590
is if we were to do a filtering we will

368
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:23,620
say now on this occasion around here

369
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:26,850
something that is really interesting of

370
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:30,750
this tool is allow us to eliminate the

371
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:36,129
trace of our execution

372
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:42,030
we're gonna press ok to eliminate any

373
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:42,030
type of traces we start the analysis

374
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:50,090
and maybe do today o do to them our

375
00:27:47,270 --> 00:28:02,480
purposes I executed it before presenting

376
00:27:50,090 --> 00:28:03,790
it to you and this is the text file by

377
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,940
mimikatz

378
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:12,260
migrated to Power Cell this is a small

379
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,970
tool but it's very useful if you if it

380
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,450
happens that you know me me that's is

381
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:23,530
really useful not to be concerned for

382
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:27,260
any anti-malware or antivirus as I said

383
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:31,600
although many state that they can detect

384
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:35,560
this type of scripts in fact nobody

385
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,560
detects them yet

386
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:42,750
here this is another tool power sploit

387
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:47,380
is well known it has many different

388
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:54,250
functionalities one of the most use

389
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:57,670
eSports can literally it scans ports

390
00:28:54,250 --> 00:29:02,309
using power cell if we don't have AdMob

391
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:08,830
or we cannot install any other program

392
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:12,940
this small script waits several many

393
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:16,270
kilobytes three megawatt and we can use

394
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,870
all those functionalities and having an

395
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,470
end

396
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,469
map

397
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:35,500
we executed and here wherever the

398
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:44,200
function named invoke post scan the host

399
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:47,230
we select is X we can exclude host if

400
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,000
we're going to use n number of IPs and

401
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,450
we can do it

402
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,450
my

403
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,659
hooters it has a limited number of ports

404
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:02,559
X number of ports but I don't remember

405
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:06,549
the figure now and we can scan for

406
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,379
example port 80 he's not going to do it

407
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:12,549
now but it's a small example of how to

408
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:16,779
use this tool and we have something

409
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:18,730
similar to n map and as you can see this

410
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:23,970
is the information the hot water the

411
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:27,460
participant closed visited and the time

412
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:30,009
without in map or installing anything

413
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:33,539
just the blue console that nobody came

414
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:43,659
blogs either by GPS or anything we can

415
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:48,009
do many different things appears

416
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:51,039
weakness I've already showed you I don't

417
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:54,220
really have anything for this if you

418
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:57,429
want have a look he's very interesting

419
00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:01,269
is a very interesting tool to check on

420
00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:03,789
an active directory of a minion it takes

421
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:07,149
on the trees and everything active

422
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:10,529
directory and he provides a full report

423
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:15,100
of what we have in an active directory

424
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:16,870
those are just a few of the tools I

425
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:21,059
wanted to show you and some of some

426
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,059
examples of it we can do

427
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:33,520
with parcel as I said we can use it for

428
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:42,550
penetration testing power exploit comes

429
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:49,510
up for incident response the most famous

430
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:53,560
in a way is PS beacon there are n number

431
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:58,860
of scripts for incident response to

432
00:31:53,560 --> 00:32:03,340
check the user and what application was

433
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:07,179
executed on the last instance and those

434
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:12,459
are all the projects the most important

435
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:18,190
one uses all of them are the name is

436
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:25,540
Empire there is a framework where we can

437
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:28,830
use all tools available we can call me

438
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:34,450
me cut from power cell port scanning

439
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:36,639
bypass from de UAC is there will be two

440
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:42,010
very interesting talks about it later on

441
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:49,650
today and tomorrow and many many things

442
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:54,600
Empire is the largest power cell project

443
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,600
that implements many different tools

444
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:07,029
you can install it in Linux is very easy

445
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:09,580
to install and in addition to being able

446
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:19,059
to carry out forensics penetration

447
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:21,549
testing and incident response is not

448
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:27,428
been in the market for 10 years as power

449
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:33,129
self love ourselves desired state

450
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:36,519
configuration we usually the name is

451
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:41,409
usually power cell DSS but it allows us

452
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:44,200
to have our infrastructure as a code

453
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:51,149
I don't know if you know anti-world

454
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:54,850
puppet it allow us to provision

455
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:59,139
infrastructure and applications in a

456
00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:00,789
declarative way for many projects that

457
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:08,069
we might have in mind one of the

458
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:13,569
examples this is an example in Microsoft

459
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:20,069
documents in a very descriptive way we

460
00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:25,750
can self set or provision a web server

461
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:29,440
just by executing this inner OS whether

462
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:33,339
locally or remotely on a number of hosts

463
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:36,399
and make different settings to the

464
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:40,089
applications sequel server exchange

465
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:46,299
share points in a very simple and

466
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:50,199
aromatized way this in the box is

467
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:55,280
incredibly powerful and we can compare

468
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:58,609
it with other existing solutions

469
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:04,599
if it rings a bell have a look it has

470
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:08,000
implementations with acid and it will be

471
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,220
stupid not to mention it we can self

472
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,310
provision many different things as a

473
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,310
code we can have different releases

474
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:26,210
I know it's lunchtime and this is just

475
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:29,629
the some information of everything I

476
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,940
wanted to present you would please urge

477
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:35,510
you to use the tool use the small blue

478
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:38,119
windows we cover develop and environment

479
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:41,240
there are many things we can do is very

480
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:46,900
easy to start working with it and I

481
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:52,549
forgot to show you something we have

482
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:56,780
help desk for everything we have a

483
00:35:52,550 --> 00:36:00,440
commander and if you do not know the

484
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:03,109
tool there's a get help a commander that

485
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:09,130
brings help about everything we might

486
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:12,859
need from any command let our module

487
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:16,130
something as right for example just to

488
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:18,440
show you an example

489
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,999
if you don't know this to leave your no

490
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,999
parcel please use it

491
00:36:19,999 --> 00:36:26,689
this command is the main one it will be

492
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:30,738
your best friend so you can start using

493
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:32,959
it it will save much time when you start

494
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:36,739
working with PowerShell you can make

495
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:39,680
everything automatic in relation to OS

496
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:44,599
and for those that are interested is

497
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:48,589
also implemented in our Linux releases

498
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:50,869
since 2016 it became open-source so

499
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:54,349
there are releases for Linux we can

500
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:56,839
automatic and no longer depend on bar

501
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:59,299
space is very powerful but he treats

502
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:02,769
everything as text and here as objects

503
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:07,339
we can treat everything as a method or

504
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:10,390
propriety or settings and he will save

505
00:37:07,339 --> 00:37:15,650
you much time from administration

506
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:18,469
whether you are admins or carry on

507
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,969
penetration testing me in case you

508
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:24,440
cannot install anything is going to be

509
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:29,509
very useful also innocent response sure

510
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:31,279
that 80% if you does that will you see

511
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:33,979
there will be on Microsoft there very

512
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:37,160
powerful tools that you can develop

513
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:41,299
really quickly the forensics and as I

514
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:45,229
said we even have devoxx implementations

515
00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:52,940
for the box we can implement it in your

516
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:57,348
servers in ashes with DSS and this is

517
00:37:52,940 --> 00:38:00,410
the end of my presentation I don't want

518
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:03,220
to take more time thank you thank you so

519
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:07,250

520
