1
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:23,480
now as an ERISA more obvious or cuanto

2
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:30,890
antes by maintaining a por ser Mariana

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:37,820
Pino come representing the defense joint

4
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:40,629
command the reason for coming here is to

5
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:47,559
let you know what we do now unit

6
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:50,420
everybody knows about the about what

7
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:55,390
defense our unit does everybody knows

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:01:04,870
what a fighter is submarine etc but

9
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:14,270
right now the chief head of state has

10
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:19,510
created this cyber defense unit with a

11
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:22,509
joint command as in charge of it

12
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,510
phenomena

13
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:34,590
for comment re-mose I like to begin with

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:44,159
a description of cyberspace which is the

15
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:51,990
place where war scenario takes place we

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:59,610
have the first domain which is countries

17
00:01:51,990 --> 00:02:04,970
or units start fighting on land then we

18
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,970
have the sea and River River unit and

19
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:16,049
the first world war we world war 1 we

20
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:22,590
see that planes start being used after

21
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:28,790
this we have fifth domain NATO etc

22
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:34,500
[Music]

23
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:38,040
missiles etc and all these things but

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,410
right now the Armed Forces be realized

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,730
that not enough attention was being paid

26
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:47,040
that the security within the devices

27
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,380
that had been connected and networks

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,399
because we mustn't forget that the all

29
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:58,500
the networks emerged thanks to military

30
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,910
initiative for instance the network said

31
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,639
that you used to connect yourselves to

32
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:12,329
communicate amongst yourselves and in

33
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:16,769
Spain we created created defense Joint

34
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:19,079
Command in 2013 before NATO recognized

35
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,810
the existence of the fifth domain and

36
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,299
operations inside the fifth domain

37
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,150
this means that according to Article

38
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:31,280
five and

39
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:35,450
a treaty that we signed an aggression an

40
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:44,120
attack in cyberspace would be like an

41
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:49,010
attack in space so that is clear how

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:52,159
important this is for NATO from 2018

43
00:03:49,010 --> 00:04:04,750
onwards new specific unit was created in

44
00:03:52,159 --> 00:04:04,750
order to give service to and within

45
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:10,939
military operations we have many devices

46
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:17,500
that are interconnected I'm sure you've

47
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:21,190
seen drones of flying soldiers on land

48
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:24,199
also interconnected through the net and

49
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:30,039
we come to a scenario similar to the one

50
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:32,300
you can see here lots of support lots of

51
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,849
control of the situation lots of

52
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,490
information the rest of the domains

53
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:39,949
depend on the security and an

54
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:45,169
interruption of communications may

55
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:47,840
represent an important blow to the

56
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:52,299
enemies so therefore it's a fundamental

57
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,530
to ensure communication communicate the

58
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,110
communications and to be able to

59
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:00,409
interrupt our communications of the

60
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:02,599
enemy and this is an addition to

61
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:05,150
classical intelligence because with a

62
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:09,430
very low risk it allows to obtain a

63
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:14,750
large amount of information without

64
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:16,729
officers exposure we all know that the

65
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,180
three basic pillars of cyber security

66
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:23,650
are confidentiality integrity and

67
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,650
availability and

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:43,000
so all this so information may be

69
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:45,610
sequestered information sequestering is

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,979
not very important because we may have

71
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,479
backups but for a company it is a

72
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,479
problem to this information

73
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:04,150
breaking into information or having

74
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:09,610
information stolen and having them

75
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:12,818
exposed in WikiLeaks the impact social

76
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,909
level is very high enough apart from

77
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:20,379
this the possibility of having military

78
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:25,680
projects stolen and this means losing

79
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:28,440
millions of euros in research for the

80
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,849
company different examples for example

81
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:36,520
shipyard shipyard as building ships for

82
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:40,389
the military and also from the point of

83
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:46,810
view of the military this is also a very

84
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:49,440
serious problem and also information

85
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:53,259
that is stolen or referred to be sold

86
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,360
and people steal information from a

87
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,550
country and sells it to another country

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,479
so there is also an economic motivation

89
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:05,310
and there are also ethnic religious

90
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:09,818
reasons that may lead to information

91
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:13,180
theft and there is also a possibility of

92
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:15,940
destroying a stored information this is

93
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,360
also very dangerous for the military

94
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:25,520
sector foreign

95
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:29,670
view the database where all the blood

96
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:35,060
groups are stolen for instance from a

97
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:37,580
blood bank all this information is also

98
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:42,240
important and then there's information

99
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,940
destruction and this also entails an

100
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,330
important cost regarding how much is

101
00:07:44,940 --> 00:08:00,390
going to cost to retrieve all that

102
00:07:47,330 --> 00:08:02,789
information from the previous slide

103
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:04,909
looking at all the macro network of

104
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,260
operations if you can attack the

105
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,570
availability of the network that

106
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,760
interconnect all these military systems

107
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:16,920
this also represents a very important

108
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,349
drawback this is not accessible to

109
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:25,790
everybody because normally we know we

110
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:29,070
need a very expensive equipment this is

111
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:31,890
available for countries this is why I'm

112
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,720
showing this transparency Parana

113
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,740
representing Africa this is a

114
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:39,930
representation of what the cyber threat

115
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,610
triangle is about and the rest of the

116
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:44,459
presentation will be based on this

117
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,460
drawing in the end this is a risk

118
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:50,040
analysis and assets that you may have

119
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,990
whether they be networks or information

120
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:58,050
and you will attack these assets in the

121
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:00,540
end of the people groups people who for

122
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:04,680
whichever reason will try to exploit

123
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:07,439
your vulnerabilities so according to

124
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,459
whether people are more interested in

125
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,460
objectives and

126
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,030
actors will change depending on what it

127
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:22,150
is they look for money or information or

128
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:25,709
industrial patents and actors will

129
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:29,230
change so will motivation and

130
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:35,530
vulnerabilities may be intrinsic for

131
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:41,290
instance budgets for sine T by defense

132
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:44,290
ministries can also be violated everyone

133
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,599
has one same the same server that one

134
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:52,110
may find in a company is relatively

135
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:56,200
simple for a hacker who hacker to know

136
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:58,240
what the your system is like or that you

137
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:03,340
have that system in your database or

138
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:11,020
server and at a given moment is to try

139
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:17,350
and their abilities developing an

140
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:22,030
exploit years ago when there was a huge

141
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:27,970
budget and when equipment were different

142
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:30,400
to what you found in the street right

143
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:33,310
now we we have the same web server

144
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,280
server than the bank of Santander has

145
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:43,660
just depends on how good your staff is

146
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:46,930
when it comes to doing the patching the

147
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,600
main stakeholders that main actors we

148
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:52,810
have in the cyber world or our enemies

149
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,920
would be sub reminisce this affects our

150
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:59,410
civilians or companies activists

151
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,459
activists this is a term that came up on

152
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,709
mixing terms hackers and activists these

153
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:09,140
are people that live in these social

154
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:11,420
networks and not only they

155
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,130
say what they wanna say but they also

156
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:19,760
produce attacks and then there's a state

157
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:23,540
agent things that everybody is thinking

158
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:28,100
of when they think of CIA or whatever

159
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:35,240
and then groups that paid by States in

160
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:38,450
order to try and and we are known if it

161
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,750
is that is companies that are set up in

162
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:45,800
order to obtain information about

163
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:48,320
possible interests of their contractors

164
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,630
and in this case what they do is to

165
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,329
devote all their efforts to obtain

166
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,420
information about the targets and then

167
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:58,729
to exploit that information for as long

168
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,880
as possible this is a very high risk for

169
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:05,000
the state Emily what is to steal

170
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,360
information and then insiders like the

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,420
example I gave you before people like

172
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:15,140
Snowden people inside a corporation who

173
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:18,500
all of a sudden start going against it

174
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:21,740
and they produce huge harm because first

175
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,910
of all they're inside the network and

176
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:29,060
all the security measures have no effect

177
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,709
and especially here they practitioners

178
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:38,410
and know what to do in order to damage a

179
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:46,790
network sometimes people are made

180
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:50,779
redundant and also they may revenge they

181
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:53,439
may leave behind a logic bomb and in

182
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,550
order to extract information remotely

183
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,449
another classical thing in no

184
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,930
presentations is what cyberspace is but

185
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:05,089
from the point of view of the users

186
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,699
users self of a net and we see that

187
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:09,880
they're in there

188
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:13,820
Google or the information in Wikipedia

189
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,780
Wikipedia we have Chinese search engine

190
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,360
everything that's in Dexter represents

191
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:23,150
30% of all the services connected to

192
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,290
internet under the water we have the

193
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:29,449
Deep Web these are services connected to

194
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,569
the Internet you cannot index because

195
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,940
they are protected by a user and

196
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,800
password an example is the accounts in

197
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,170
the banks of people that you must log

198
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,500
whereas you cannot access and then

199
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:51,530
beneath this we have the dark web you

200
00:13:42,500 --> 00:14:04,310
can access like to encrypted services

201
00:13:51,530 --> 00:14:08,839
for instance used reporting on criminal

202
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:12,699
activities pedophilia cetera and the

203
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:16,670
cyber criminals their main motivation is

204
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:19,940
basically money so what could happen

205
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:22,360
somebody whom you think is not a risk

206
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,650
for instance for the Ministry of Defense

207
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:30,320
somebody who just wants money shouldn't

208
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:34,209
be for instance or somebody who works as

209
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:45,230
a mercenary so the country the Hashi

210
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:49,460
sets up an intermediate barrier cyber

211
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:52,850
crime is people make lots of money

212
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:59,350
in 2015 was that that cybercrime was

213
00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:02,390
more preferable than drug dealing so the

214
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,690
more and more countries in Eastern

215
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:08,819
Europe with their mafias are moving

216
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:12,779
their business towards a cybercrime

217
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:22,079
going into a bank with a gun doesn't

218
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:24,029
produce a much profit doing cyber crime

219
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,669
is much more profitable as you can

220
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:36,809
imagine and you can do remotely and then

221
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:39,179
TTP's massive fighting once you find

222
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:40,169
that an attacker what you need to do is

223
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:43,999
to moralized

224
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:49,609
the model that attacker how do they work

225
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:53,189
we can define a profile of the attacker

226
00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:55,709
you can try and have an idea of who is

227
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:58,199
attacking you because normally the

228
00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:00,449
defense is reactive normally you've been

229
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,189
attacked first you find out you have

230
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,469
been attacked and you try and find out

231
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:08,368
what's happened so we try and use to

232
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:10,009
model the attacker so if you know that

233
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:14,039
you are the banker sent and they're

234
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:15,959
those people kill demitri and rob you

235
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,239
you need to protect yourself against

236
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:23,819
there's techniques used by the attacker

237
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:24,979
in a case we must be protected against

238
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:30,049

239
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:34,699
powerful organized groups you try and

240
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:37,949
bet themselves in the defense ministry

241
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:41,628
they can buy exploits in the black

242
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:45,149
market you need to have a much greater

243
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:48,059
security level than an SME for instance

244
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:53,899
you need to invest a lot of money in

245
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:56,789
defense and you need to obtain the

246
00:16:53,899 --> 00:17:00,929
commitment indicator cyber criminals

247
00:16:56,789 --> 00:17:05,009
what they do normally is to go in

248
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:09,859
through emails and aimed at potential

249
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:12,520
victims the more targeted the email is

250
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:16,839
the more credible

251
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:22,089
is going to be for people to click on it

252
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:34,090
and type the bank account passwords for

253
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:36,730
instance people will send you weekly or

254
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:42,730
monthly a report with a summary of a

255
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:45,910
bunch of events arms information this

256
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:52,150
mail comes it looks like a summary from

257
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:57,180
the net NATO use agents whatever so you

258
00:17:52,150 --> 00:18:00,280
open it up there's an exploit that

259
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:02,470
infects the machine the attack has done

260
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,899
his homework and did a good

261
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:12,270
characterization of the victim systems

262
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:12,270
they know the operating system and the

263
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:21,040
PowerPoint for instance they can just go

264
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:24,130
in and I try to connect their server and

265
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,670
keep downloading things in the case of

266

home cyber criminals probably all

267
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:38,680
they're going to do is to download a

268
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:41,440
whole bunch of packages do they want to

269
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,200
stay many years in your network but in

270
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,170
the end me procedures are the same the

271
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,480
only thing is that techniques people who

272
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,630
are attacking this since they have money

273
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:57,260
they buy exploits they go to the black

274
00:18:52,630 --> 00:19:02,830
market and buy them

275
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,830
they have an ability to purchase to buy

blackmail them do horrible things

internet the writing in Twitter and also

284
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:51,350
they can do you service denial different

up the level of ethnic and religious

campaigns through Facebook and Twitter

that are open in order to have a greater

292
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:25,309
audience and what they do is to allow a

293

bunch of people to join anonymous once

294

distributed service denial somebody a

bit more enthusiastic they will try to

do is to do about like in order to net

in order to attack any targets they want

to attack normally

order to have some type of

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:47,159
infrastructure within the profiles of

309
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:51,309
activists you have Steppenwolf's here he

310
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:54,400
may be terrorists who may be linked to

311
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:58,470
Isis for instance and maybe somebody

312
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:02,800
who's black hack and here for which ever

313
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:04,540
reason decide to do something the normal

314
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,280
thing is for hacktivists to work in

315
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:13,750
groups these activists are very hard to

316
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,178
detect because they do not deploy their

317
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:27,580
campaigns in areas that are controlled

318
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:32,860
by state security cops security forces

319
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:35,889
and security cops normally study and

320
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:38,830
focus on a certain type of users and

321
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:41,100
this entails an economic cost and human

322
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,100
cost

323
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:49,210
please don't think that they watch every

324
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:58,070
single thing you everybody writes on

325
00:22:49,210 --> 00:23:01,760
Twitter you may use key words you may

326
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:04,809
see well these terms have been I've

327
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,269
showing up I don't know how many times

328
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:11,570
you need to learn whatever language as

329
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:15,440
being used Java in fact it was kind of

330
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:19,399
so Hector ist's look for publicity in

331
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,299
their actions a group like Anonymous try

332
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:25,668
to become notorious if they can do

333
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:29,510
defacement or spy on a website for five

334
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:31,760
minutes that's what they are after for

335
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:35,480
from the state's perspective this is

336
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:39,350
only damage to the image for example if

337
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:46,460
ministry's website is hacked or for

338
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:50,029
example the Twitter account of us then

339
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:53,659
we're stolen and they really damaged

340
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:55,970
their image so it's nothing further than

341
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:59,690
becoming ridiculous well it can cost

342
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:03,760
somebody their their job for example but

343
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:08,360
it's not a state level defense matter

344
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:11,000
when I was talking about the botnets is

345
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:15,769
that you can control them for example

346
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:19,190
the operation in Catalonia well they

347
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:22,220
weren't able to find supporters to

348
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:28,610
perform massive attacks however if you

349
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:32,600
pay people for generating 600 gigabytes

350
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:37,158
per second that is unbearable and in

351
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:40,480
these cases the economic damage has its

352
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,480
consequences of course

353
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:47,650
well then we have the attackers with the

354
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,660
state's support these are our greatest

355
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,900
concern they have time and they have

356
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:55,390
money usually attackers have the time

357
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,700
advantage that is they can attack

358
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:02,350
whenever they want and when they feel

359
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:06,520
ready however you need to be on alert 24

360
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:09,159
hours you know the to avoid threats they

361
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:13,110
can map your networks map your users

362
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:17,020
they can prepare fising emails they can

363
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:20,260
try to introduce a blog they can map

364
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:23,230
your network you are always on the

365
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:28,840
defensive so these are people who have

366
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:31,660
money you have time and all the apts

367
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,649
that big corporations for example McAfee

368
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:42,000
is Simon tech worker skorsky have and

369
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:45,309
published reports on different campaigns

370
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,350
carried out by the same groups of people

371
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:51,100
using different names but what they

372
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:53,260
leave behind is a fingerprint sometimes

373
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,040
they want you to know that it was them

374
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:59,170
and well that allows you to characterize

375
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,500
them so they usually change their

376
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:04,630
tactics but the techniques are usually

377
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:07,480
the same and the entrance vector is

378
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,670
generally the facing vector

379
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,100
they've also adapted themselves to

380
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:15,070
defensive measures if you know a little

381
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:19,030
bit about how defensive devices have

382
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:22,389
evolved and what probabilistic detection

383
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,850
is well they know that in the past when

384
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:28,600
you characterized a network you could

385
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:30,669
say well computer that is encoding

386
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,480
information in on a Saturday at 4:00

387
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,090
a.m.

388
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:37,360
and malicious why because nobody is

389
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:41,379
working on a public building at the time

390
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:43,840
and on that day so if the computer is

391
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,970
connected on a Saturday night that is

392
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,399
totally abnormal and if they is

393
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:52,029
extracting Jacob Ides of information

394
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:54,279
that is a clear attack and the

395
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:57,720
consequences of that attack cannot be

396
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:00,760
seen until until the Monday after

397
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:05,860
therefore you need a 24/7 monitoring

398
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:08,500
service in order to monitor 24/7 that

399
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,750
something is going on so when the

400
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,320
attackers realized that they cannot

401
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:16,480
connect and extract that information

402
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:20,139
they decided to change their tactics and

403
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,809
they decide to attack during the daytime

404
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:25,719
and extract smaller amounts of

405
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:28,120
information so in the daytime when

406
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,929
people access for example sports

407
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:37,719
websites or food web sites well that

408
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:41,100
traffic can be masked if your detection

409
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,990
system is good enough you'll be able to

410
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,570
find out that the connections take place

411
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,809
in China or Russia or other foreign

412
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:52,570
countries but still when they realize

413
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:55,899
that you are controlling certain IP

414
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:58,090
addresses they are going to use all the

415
00:27:55,899 --> 00:28:01,809
tactics for example now we're using

416
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:05,408
Dropbox accounts then you close accounts

417
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:08,230
but they will try something else so they

418
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:11,080
always find the way to access the

419
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:16,510
information that's why this last point

420
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:21,840
is important in 2012 the window for

421
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:26,590
filtering information the deadline was

422
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,959
416 days this figure has gone down with

423
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:31,360
time but these are the days when they

424
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,320
can still documents or reports or

425
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:38,620
anything from you well this is partly

426
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:41,379
due to the fact that the expenditure on

427
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:44,168
defense has increased as well

428
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:47,049
so then we have the insiders they work

429
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:49,360
in the organization they are hard to

430
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:51,460
detect because if they are

431
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,879
administrators or if they have

432
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:58,480
privileges inside the company for

433
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,090
example accessing the data servers or

434
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,750
sometimes they can access paper files

435
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:10,389
well they are internal threats and the

436
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:14,669
only way of detecting these threats is

437
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:18,730
not only publishing it on social media

438
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:22,090
you need to be alert to anomalous

439
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:26,110
situations at work in order to detect

440
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:29,559
these people fighting back in the

441
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:36,459
Mannings case this was discovered

442
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:40,990
because this guy thought that the u.s.

443
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:45,010
practices in Abu Ghraib were unethical

444
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:46,990
and the same widths now than that

445
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:51,309
filtered information that thought was

446
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:53,590
dangerous for the US population so if

447
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:56,918
this happens in a company they will

448
00:29:53,590 --> 00:30:01,178
probably fire their IT department and

449
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:05,909
end up outsourcing the service so we

450
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:09,190
need to be alerted to these things and

451
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:12,480
and try to prevent attacks from

452
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:17,200
happening a way of finding out about

453
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:20,980
malicious activities is the use of honey

454
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:25,450
pots or honey nets a honey pot is what

455
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:29,200
it is a pot full of honey a decoy that

456
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:36,730
is a group of servers with marked or

457
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:38,890
labeled information this is you use true

458
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,870
and false information in the same

459
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,510
document and if you see that the

460
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:47,439
information has been filtered to the

461
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:51,190
press for example and you see that the

462
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,360
fake news came up you can discover how

463
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:59,370
it was felt

464
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:06,000
you can deny the authorship of the

465
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:09,310
document and at the same time you can

466
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,710
put up an infected PDF file for example

467
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:18,940
for them to download so this way you can

468
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:22,330
practice who which user in the network

469
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:25,530
pulled out the files I underlined the

470
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,970
term user why because in digital

471
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:31,149
investigations it's important to say

472
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:35,200
that this was done by a user through an

473
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:39,240
equipment through machine the authorship

474
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:46,870
the hue of the Criminal Investigation is

475
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:50,500
more complicated in the cyber world this

476
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:53,679
picture helps us understand a little bit

477
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:59,640
better what I have just said if the

478
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:02,640
criminals are on the left and they

479
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:07,840
attack massively they are only

480
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:10,450
interested in money so the bigger the

481
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,949
ransomware campaign the better the more

482
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:17,890
infected people the more money for them

483
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:21,640
however on the other end of the error we

484
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:24,310
have the insiders the insiders have the

485
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:31,140
very precise targets they are going to

486
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:31,139
attack their company only then

487
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:41,450
you can trust your allies and for

488
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:43,639
example if you are from NATO you can

489
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:47,330
discard a number of nations that want

490
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:50,690
attack here then we have competitors if

491
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:55,850
you are Samsung for instance you can

492
00:32:50,690 --> 00:33:00,049
suspect that IBM or other IT companies

493
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:03,559
are trying to find its secrets against

494
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:07,879
you then we have criminal hackers that

495
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:12,190
look for money and sell the services to

496
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:15,860
the Mafia and also to foreign nations

497
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:19,400
for example an person who's unemployed

498
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:22,250
and who knows some hacker to help them

499
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,320
out that could be in a scenario that

500
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,630
could be a scenario - but mostly their

501
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:31,570
services are provided to mafia groups

502
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:36,850
that pay very good salaries by the way

503
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:41,299
now we have the network defense based on

504
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:42,350
intelligence this is as follows if

505
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:44,629
you're able to find out information

506
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,730
about what's going on in your networks

507
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:49,820
in terms of security you have to

508
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:53,419
implement that as a defensive measure if

509
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:57,200
you find anomalous traffic you must be

510
00:33:53,419 --> 00:34:01,309
able to characterize it and create a

511
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:05,720
rule so that that detection capability

512
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:08,210
turns into something physical so that

513
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,780
with that rule you can prevent things

514
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:18,440
from happen if you have advanced methods

515
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:25,389
you can only you can not only detect but

516
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:29,929
also prevent however there are always

517
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:33,830
analysts behind the attacks and no

518
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:38,600
machine will ever outperform and

519
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:44,569
and his capacity of telling if there is

520
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:48,310
a false positive or a real case if you

521
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:52,280
let machines to control the total

522
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:58,490
network traffic you would probably be in

523
00:34:52,280 --> 00:35:03,830
a mess now going back to attackers a

524
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:07,430
PT's will try to deceit you time and

525
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:11,330
time again which are common in large

526
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:14,629
corporations is that they buy io C's

527
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:16,610
indicators of commitments why because

528
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,520
it's difficult for you to characterize

529
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:22,010
all threads or have a global vision of

530
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,900
the entire system for example a provider

531
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:30,020
such as Simon Tech has more than 20,000

532
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,850
probes all over the world whereas in

533
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,910
your company you're only able to see

534
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:38,089
what is happening in your company but if

535
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:40,850
your peeps are everywhere you know that

536
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:42,980
an attack taking place in Taiwan may

537
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:47,569
come to Europe in a couple of days

538
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:52,670
because this is a global issue so a file

539
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:54,590
an infected file can be exported very

540
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:58,070
easily everybody works with the same

541
00:35:54,590 --> 00:36:02,840
hardware with the same operating systems

542
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:06,710
so the victim operating systems may be

543
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:15,080
victims also in the other corner of the

544
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:18,890
world so if you take it your attacks or

545
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:21,230
if you target your defense you will be

546
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,580
better off because you know what's

547
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:26,720
happening to you and what's happening to

548
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:29,150
others recommendation is not to buy that

549
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,830
kind of information from many different

550
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:36,200
providers if you compare the information

551
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:39,770
between three or four companies most of

552
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,009
the results will match they have

553
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:48,870
agreements

554
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:52,080
among themselves to share signatures so

555
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:54,569
the hashes are interchangeable and the

556
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,150
companies exchanged them here we are

557
00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:00,000
talking about detection beyond the hash

558
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,840
we're talking about behavior network

559
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,540
connections that can be inside the files

560
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:12,750
the companies are competitors and they

561
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:16,500
create more advanced devices more

562
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:19,680
advanced that the hash themselves so I

563
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:23,430
can find out what they are doing the

564
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,890
login used in Windows for example if all

565
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,770
that information is used as a signature

566
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:31,259
inside the malware that costs a lot of

567
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:33,600
money because it requires a great amount

568
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,650
of time for research and not all the

569
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:40,710
companies can afford that we are the

570
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:43,860
state and we have a dedicated person we

571
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:46,440
have more where investigation Department

572
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:49,340
in what we do is to characterize our

573
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:53,550
information but we complete that with

574
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:56,250
external information because if you are

575
00:37:53,550 --> 00:38:01,800
too focused on what is happening in your

576
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:05,310
network only you won't be aware of what

577
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:09,840
is going on elsewhere so instead of an

578
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:12,720
external provider we use our own

579
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:16,290
providers with a mis platform that is

580
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,620
used for the exchange of Io sees and if

581
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:25,950
that source is trustworthy it is very

582
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:27,830
useful but if you are only interested in

583
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:32,520
your own business and you don't want to

584
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:35,460
share your IOC's or your results then

585
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:39,560
you are worse off with respect to your

586
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:43,440
competitors i sees our indicators of

587
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:49,290
compromise they may be atomic that is

588
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:53,500
tiny very small undividable malware they

589
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:56,350
can be computed for example the hash

590
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:00,100
Hanjour file and i have the signature

591
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:04,750
and i can easily define it as malware

592
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:09,730
they won't be two files having the same

593
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:12,670
hash some attackers know that you can

594
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:17,080
detect there are hashes so what they do

595
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:21,190
is make small modifications and the code

596
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:25,840
in order to release different dogs and

597
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:30,670
all the ones use diffuse logic which

598
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:32,590
look for blocks instead of performing

599
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:36,820
the global search and if there are

600
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:41,620
partial coincidence there are chances

601
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:46,180
that that file is indeed infected then

602
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:48,040
there is the behavior if there is a

603
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,100
process that always connected to the

604
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:54,040
same IP address we can identify that at

605
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:59,819
least it belongs to the same family and

606
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,820
we can also detect the mode of operation

607
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:06,100
it's easy to find that they come from

608
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:08,549
either Russia China or North Korea which

609
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:11,890
are the countries that typically hit

610
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:20,770
European business this is the Mitra

611
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:24,270
system developed by a US company f-35 is

612
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:27,270
one of its most ambitious and well known

613
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:31,990
projects and sadly it became famous

614
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:35,920
because supposedly Chinese operation got

615
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:39,549
into their networks for many years for

616
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,670
many years they were using their servers

617
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:47,170
and they were drawing information from

618
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:51,260
the f-35 project so the Chinese were

619
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:53,600
able to copy all that

620
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:58,480
technology they weren't able to clone

621
00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:01,460
the turbines but many of the f-35

622
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:10,640
features were covered by the Chinese who

623
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:14,080
saved millions of euros planes are only

624
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:18,950
defensive but they are very good combat

625
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:22,009
planes anyway so they learned from the

626
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,919
plane and they from this example and

627
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,060
they decided to create their own

628
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,270
Department that's how they came up with

629
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,950
this modeling and we've all used it

630
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:35,390
because it's very good and attacked

631
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:39,140
starts with a recognition phase trying

632
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:41,569
to look for targets the operating

633
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,240
systems they have etc and then they go

634
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:47,060
to the weaponization that is I need to

635
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,000
find a weapon against it I need to find

636
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:52,880
a medium for infection whether it is an

637
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,060
email a flash drive something that can

638
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:00,920
be downloaded from the internet a fake

639
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:04,759
access point well you need to find your

640
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,950
way then the next phase is the

641
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,010
exploitation phase remote control

642
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:13,490
execution and maintenance people try to

643
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:16,400
maintain the persistence as I explained

644
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:19,700
before and against that model we have

645
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,390
the reverse method the intuition kill

646
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:27,830
chain we use the attackers

647
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:33,680
vulnerabilities in order to get him so

648
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:36,740
the sooner you can get them the less the

649
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,049
damage so it's important to start

650
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:45,919
detecting that they are downloading

651
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:48,560
packages from suspicious IPS or finding

652
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:53,840
out computers that are compromised in

653
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:58,029
the network you can find out how long

654
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:05,240
they've been in your system etc

655
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:07,820
well you know the to be a child in these

656
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,950
you need to move as fast as possible to

657
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:13,460
the delivery face so that they don't get

658
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:16,129
inside your organization the in the

659
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:19,580
ideal world you would need to get them

660
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:22,850
in the recognition phase having people

661
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:25,580
going into for detecting information

662
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:27,170
about exploits because if you find out

663
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:31,220
that they are trying to exchange that

664
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:35,240
information you can react promptly and

665
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:38,689
patch your vulnerabilities and all the

666
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:41,209
way of modeling this is this one from

667
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:45,620
the hands Institute it is the so-called

668
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:48,410
diamund model it is similar to the

669
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:53,630
former one but it adds the social

670
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:57,980
political ring for example with the

671
00:43:53,630 --> 00:44:00,670
Catalonian issue there is another thing

672
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:06,290
to be borne in mind which is the social

673
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:12,290
context and to wrap up this is the cycle

674
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:16,580
for event management first we detected

675
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:20,480
the event we respond promptly and we

676
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:24,200
analyze the intrusion it has to cover

677
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,840
the planification face to be effective

678
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:31,310
if there is no planning the rest of the

679
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:36,160
chain is worthless so this is a chain

680
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:41,330
that needs to cover each and every step

681
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:44,480
you know we have a flow chart showing

682
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:48,610
how the operations center and the

683
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,610
research units exchange information for

684
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,610
detection

685
00:44:52,470 --> 00:45:02,529
so that they feet the detection

686
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:07,240
capability and benefits the organization

687
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:09,550
from the defensive perspective in our

688
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:12,330
case we work this way and in our

689
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:17,110
operation center we need people

690
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:19,710
everything updated the probes setup and

691
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:23,230
if you want to have your staff working

692
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:27,580
24/7 or not that's up to you you have to

693
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:31,300
train your personnel and/or make them

694
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:33,009
capable of detecting the alerts and that

695
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,490
was all for me yeah if you have any

696
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,490
questions

697
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:46,538
yes what about yes

698
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:46,539
