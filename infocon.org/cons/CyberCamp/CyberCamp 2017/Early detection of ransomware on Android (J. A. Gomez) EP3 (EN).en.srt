1
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:28,790
we're not thought of it good afternoon

2
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:31,278
we're here two percent presentation that

3
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:35,030
we made in June this year and the

4
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,090
conference that received an award thanks

5
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:41,059
to in Phoebus sponsorship we can be here

6
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:44,210
to present this study this study was

7
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:46,040
conducted by pedo Garfield Garcia the

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,020
other are Lucy Alvarez who will make

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,769
this presentation together with me and

10
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,449
myself regarding the table of contents

11
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:55,729
of this presentation that could be

12
00:00:53,449 --> 00:01:00,949
divided into two parts the study we

13
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:03,860
conducted which is 0.2 or item two which

14
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:06,950
is the technique that we've used in

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,320
order to block ransomware and an

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:15,560
equipment in order to be able to detect

17
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:18,830
it before it does its job it's malicious

18
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:24,190
job and then I'm going to introduce

19
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:27,860
ransomware aware problems associated the

20
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:30,770
detection techniques and then I'll

21
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,670
explain to you the technique that we've

22
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,979
developed and I'm basically going to

23
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:42,350
explain to you what grants where is

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:44,750
about ransomware is a form of malware or

25
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,899
malicious software it's a family of

26
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,130
malicious software and when installed in

27
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,390
the equipment

28
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:58,399
it basically extorts or blackmails

29
00:01:52,390 --> 00:02:03,380
economic blackmail ransom is asked so

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,289
the user can recover the control of the

31
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:10,489
equipment

32
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:13,250
we've focused more on encryption malware

33
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:16,459
basically accessing the hard drive of

34
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,310
the effective equipment encrypting all

35
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:23,150
the files once encrypted they are erased

36
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:25,489
and then they ask for a ransom to the

37
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,060
user of the device for the piece of

38
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:32,239
equipment in order for that a user to be

39
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,420
able to regain control so the data are

40
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,370
hijacked the date of the infected

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,339
machine and that's why it can be

42
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,950
considered a do s attack denial of

43
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,660
service attack and there are other kinds

44
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:53,390
of extortions that - or threads of the

45
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:58,879
user without publishing personal data or

46
00:02:53,390 --> 00:03:01,160
pictures this is tried by download

47
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,290
distribution we can download them

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:08,660
through Word documents through the

49
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:12,108
macros mechanism of word processors some

50
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:16,430
can be downloaded through PowerShell

51
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:19,430
scripts which is the order interpreter

52
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,180
for current Windows system also through

53
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,269
voyons

54
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,419
another very commonly used technique

55
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:30,859
this fishing through an email that has

56
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:34,669
embedded an executable file with

57
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:37,400
ransomware or a link that redirects us

58
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:42,590
to a link a web page in order to

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:45,800
download malware you have a typical

60
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:49,220
image of ransomware

61
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:53,480
I one of the screens you can see once

62
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:57,050
the data have been encrypted you can see

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,670
the screen requesting a ransom usually

64
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,950
this a payment has to be done in

65
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:06,940
bitcoins in order to be able to track

66
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:06,940
the payment there are different types of

67
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:19,930
walking and pretty easy to bypass

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:25,070
basically mechanism is found through the

69
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:28,280
graphic interface for example blocking

70
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:32,420
the use of the computer modifying the

71
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,179
user interface and in this case these

72
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:39,140
are easier to bypass and they don't

73
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:42,140
generate serious promise the most

74
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:47,960
commonly used and that our most harmful

75
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:51,740
are the crypto lockers ie those ransom

76
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,940
wears that block and the files of the

77
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:58,709
hard drive fully booked them then they

78
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:04,509
ask where ransom

79
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:06,489
to return the control and that sometimes

80
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:09,399
happens others not and we need to be

81
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:12,909
prepared not to we see that even if we

82
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:17,139
do pay the ransom that we have another

83
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:19,539
more minority types of ransomware for

84
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:24,749
example and B are those that modify the

85
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:28,089
MBR to prevent the booting of the system

86
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:31,929
or those that allow us to recover the

87
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:37,479
controller system if we send an SMS or

88
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:40,359
text message this is a bit small but I

89
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:45,068
wanted to show you with this slide that

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:50,289
which seems to be a metro map is the

91
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:58,049
evolution ransom families as you can see

92
00:05:50,289 --> 00:06:01,839
if you take a look at the 2013 2007 rate

93
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:04,539
2015-2017 story the number of families

94
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,959
has been on the increase and the

95
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:10,269
forecast is that this number will grow

96
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:14,649
in the upcoming years in the lower part

97
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:17,050
you take a look at 2016 2017 you see

98
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:19,689
that there is an exponential growth and

99
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:24,129
the forecast is that it will continue to

100
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:28,089
grow exponentially this is due to the

101
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:31,719
economic profit obtain the estimated

102
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:34,200
cost for this year or 1 billion dollars

103
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:38,730
1 billion dollars and then

104
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:45,390
many case random aware requests small

105
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:48,800
amounts of money 200-300 euros yes the

106
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:52,740
profit is made when a good ransomware

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,490
when doing when the Schism actions can

108
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:59,340
infect thousands and thousands of

109
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,920
devices as we saw some months ago with

110
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,380
wanna cry so the economic profit

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:07,770
obtained by cyber criminals is pretty

112
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,290
high and as a result all the families

113
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,180
have been some weird have grown during

114
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:15,750
their past times and their provision is

115
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:21,060
that the family will continue growing

116
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:23,970
during the next years here you can see

117
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:28,080
how ransomware or encryption around

118
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:32,610
somewhere operates basically in the case

119
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,490
of an attachment a phishing attachment

120
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,370
is an attachment that is executable and

121
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,490
that infects the device our equipment

122
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,830
once an equipment is infected with the

123
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,400
rents of our does is to generate a

124
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:52,080
public and a private password that are

125
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,719
sent to command and control server hmm

126
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,510
so that the cyber criminal has the

127
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:03,630
private password to decipher the files

128
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:06,360
so all the files in the disk drive are

129
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:10,320
in the hard drive are encrypted the

130
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:13,170
original files are raised and the user

131
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,599
then loses control over his computer

132
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:19,410
because he no longer has access to his

133
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,080
data once that is done there's a screen

134
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,669
or window that appears asking for a

135
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,370
ransom to be paid

136
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,849
for an individual user we can be talking

137
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,310
about 200 euros for a company can be

138
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:37,919
twenty seventeen thousand twenty

139
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:42,369
thousand dollars usually cyber criminals

140
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:45,069
and I'm negotiating with the victim to

141
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,100
decrease the amount of reason agreement

142
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,740
regarding the amount to be paid and

143
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,750
there are some families of ransomware

144
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:57,730
for you to understand the complexity

145
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:59,470
that in order to facilitate payment to

146
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,750
the victim what they do is to open up

147
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,480
with chat so that the victim can share

148
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,390
with a cyber criminal that tells him how

149
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:18,699
he should pay the process that he needs

150
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:21,010
to follow to recover his control and

151
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:26,189
protection point of view you have a

152
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:30,010
carafe of secure lmg security company

153
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:33,880
which is very illustrative so we apply

154
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:37,839
the 3r mechanism recovery response and

155
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,680
reduction of risk from the point of view

156
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,680
of recovery

157
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:52,720
from the point of view of recovery as I

158
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:56,060
was saying the most commonly used

159
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,520
technique and we need to have as a

160
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:03,199
backup once we are possibly infected

161
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:08,720
what is recommended is to of course have

162
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:14,810
a backup copy recent updated backups and

163
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:20,630
of course you also need to have a policy

164
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:23,000
for the updating of backups and backups

165
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:26,660
shouldn't be accessible through the

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,620
internet because Karen transom wares can

167
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,839
not only affect an equipment but to

168
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:38,630
affect the entire network

169
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:42,740
so we have our backups in network discs

170
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:45,290
will probably that this will be affected

171
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,300
as well from the point of view of the

172
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,790
response to ransomware there are

173
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,800
different techniques available we

174
00:10:49,790 --> 00:11:00,110
focused on technical techniques through

175
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:02,270
mechanism of deception and as my

176
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,150
colleague lúthien will explain basically

177
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:08,900
as a matter about putting a trap and

178
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:16,600
that trap trap simulates an infinite

179
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:19,880
file so what we do is block ie to allow

180
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,700
ransomware to exes infinite files and to

181
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,610
block it so once it's blocked

182
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:30,320
you're able to interrupt its activities

183
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:33,170
we were able to respond to ransomware to

184
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:38,460
detect the process that is executing the

185
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:43,849
encryption to kill it and to block it

186
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:49,710
but there are other types of responses

187
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:52,620
training a team of first responders in

188
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:54,660
case incidents or events occur but we

189
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,529
have no time now to go into the details

190
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,920
and then we have Risk Reduction ie

191
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:03,689
taking necessary measures to prevent

192
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:08,880
infection there you have some examples

193
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:11,790
well of course many companies are hiring

194
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,160
on insurance are getting insurance to

195
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,949
protect themselves from ransomware and

196
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,010
other attacks and from a technical point

197
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:22,760
of view the more effective solutions are

198
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:26,730
the filtering of emails and web traffic

199
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,689
so as to detect these potential

200
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:35,250
infections of course also to have

201
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:40,380
two-factor authentication in place and

202
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:42,029
öktem phishing exercises in house so

203
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,510
that the users and the different

204
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:50,070
workstations are able to identify

205
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:54,569
phishing emails those emails that can be

206
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:56,880
potentially malicious of course it's

207
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,670
very important to maintain software to

208
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,300
reduce the attack surface and we need to

209
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:06,479
have antivirus is duly installed of

210
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,910
course aam antivirus don't took van

211
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,440
hundred percent protection but the best

212
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:17,610
known malware can be protected against

213
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,020
with these antivirus random-ass where

214
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:25,800
exploitable near abilities and many

215
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,020
antivirus are not affected effective in

216
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,439
combating ransomware one of the

217
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:36,300
techniques we implemented I will explain

218
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:39,390
has to do with this preserving and the

219
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:44,010
idea is putting traps her to ransom

220
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:45,990
and ransomware or non wrathful Weirich

221
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,839
will fall into the traps that we need to

222
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,540
be able to place traps intelligently and

223
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:56,300
it's very important that we integrated

224
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,300
security that we test security regularly

225
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:04,529
and we always have the doubt on whether

226
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:08,130
we need to pay that ransom or not of

227
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:11,939
course and you pay the extortion or the

228
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:15,060
ransom and tells additional problems as

229
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:19,140
you can imagine this cyber criminal

230
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:24,619
clove xor caches said money has profits

231
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:28,740
and part of his job is to reinvest a new

232
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:32,519
ransomware so you want to interrupt or

233
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:38,790
break this vicious cycle we need to

234
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:41,040
force not pay of course if you don't pay

235
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,380
you're not going to be returned

236
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,240
the exes where the control over your

237
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:52,459
system and last year one third of the

238
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:57,890
affected users did pay the ransom

239
00:14:52,459 --> 00:15:00,989
requested and we see that this occurred

240
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:04,500
more frequently and companies as opposed

241
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:08,730
to individuals so in companies what we

242
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:12,120
see is that the equipment is affected

243
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,490
infected that translates into down times

244
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,149
we've seen how hospitals have been

245
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:20,399
infected with ransomware police stations

246
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,640
as well we're talking about thick

247
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,459
entities institutions and companies and

248
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,580
is kind of extortion translates into

249
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,959
downtime

250
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:37,500
and in many cases

251
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:39,270
many studies have shown that managers

252
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,730
and the management and companies have

253
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:50,670
some money on this side in order to pay

254
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:55,530
this ransom ransomware from the point of

255
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:57,180
view of defense mechanisms I like to say

256
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:01,380
that there are different types of

257
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,689
defense and mechanisms I like to set the

258
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:06,780
context so that you can understand our

259
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:08,790
proposal our proposal has to do with

260
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,910
behavior analysis when a process is

261
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:14,790
executed in our case in an operating

262
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:16,260
system these are the equipment we need

263
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,849
to see the interaction with the

264
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,030
environment and depending on that

265
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,370
interaction we will have to see to

266
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:28,350
distinguish whether it's more or legal

267
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:32,030
software interactions with files but

268
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:34,530
network connections potential

269
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:37,970
modifications of the operating system

270
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:41,069
and there you have different proposals

271
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:45,570
the two of the we've developed is a

272
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:50,250
behavior analysis tool so it's not just

273
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:55,860
about general analyses we also generate

274
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:58,860
what we call honey on files to trap and

275
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:03,000
somewhere we to block ransomware when it

276
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:07,290
attempts to access our files it's very

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,880
simple and it's quite effective and all

278
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:15,240
processes that time 2x is the file

279
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,760
walked now we have some proposals or

280
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,460
keep the process and basically what they

281
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,150
do is analyze all the isolation of

282
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,160
friends where were the system and with

283
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:28,250
cryptic where Hegeman

284
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,950
Tyrael so it basically stores and for a

285
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:34,240
data regarding the cools of the

286
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:38,360
parameters in order to obtain that

287
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,400
recovery key the ideas that we can

288
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,860
detect the interaction of that

289
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,560
ransomware with the files know what keys

290
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:49,580
have been generated and tried to did not

291
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:52,070
deduct sorry recovery key then we have

292
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,649
the cryptographic primitive detection

293
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,189
technique that analyzes the binaries in

294
00:17:54,650 --> 00:18:01,220
order to understand the behavior of

295
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:04,820
ransomware to know what kind of

296
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:07,550
encryption system is used and how and

297
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:11,000
last what we've seen is that another of

298
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:13,879
the techniques that are being used is an

299
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,620
automated learning technique that

300
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:21,470
basically extracts the features of p9

301
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:24,199
programs and all these techniques of

302
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,350
course have some false positives and

303
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:31,610
false negatives that can pose some

304
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:37,189
problems the proposal that we've

305
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:39,530
designed and assume computer and

306
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:43,400
security word publish or study we are

307
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:47,389
still awaiting the date but it'll be

308
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,760
probably very soon in our proposal says

309
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,100
that there is no false positive nor

310
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,800
false negatives because we're able to

311
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:58,689
detect all processes that interact with

312
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,690
a Hani file we've put into place

313
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:09,110
from the point of view of detection what

314
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:13,959
are the problems associated to

315
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:18,709
ransomware for those techniques that use

316
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:20,900
behavior analysis components one of the

317
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:26,300
main promise that we've seen as office

318
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:32,570
occasion to alter the code of the date

319
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:38,330
of ransomware so they are equivalent but

320
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:45,470
the visuals would be different and this

321
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:49,030
is used for antivirus and in general

322
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:52,100
we've seen this applied both for

323
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:55,100
ransomware and malware and when this

324
00:19:52,100 --> 00:20:00,020
technique is used the signature is no

325
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:04,699
longer valid then we have this so-called

326
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:08,660
white box cryptic cryptography basically

327
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:14,000
what we do is to vary eight techniques

328
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:20,320
different to encryption so we don't see

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:25,160
the traditional encryption behavior and

330
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,200
we've also seen the ransomware of the

331
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,760
things we are now talking about the

332
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,500
Internet of the things and just as we

333
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,629
have the Internet of the things we have

334
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,030
the ransomware of the things basically

335
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:39,110
we're going to detect them as wearing

336
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:41,600
sensors devices so currently it's not a

337
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:45,919
major problem but it will probably be in

338
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,540
the near future and this is I like to

339
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,340
say that one of the problems that we're

340
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:53,060
going to encounter will be the

341
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:57,830
combination of ransomware and root key a

342
00:20:53,060 --> 00:21:02,178
root key is the software that hides

343
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:05,350
from the eyes of observers among them as

344
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:10,159
systems for network administrators

345
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:13,248
behind so what we see is that probably

346
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,279
soon we'll see ransomware that hides and

347
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:19,009
that will go undetected or will be hard

348
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:21,970
to detect and recently we've identified

349
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:24,739
the so-called social technical attacks

350
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:29,029
some months ago there was around swear

351
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:30,619
for a by extortion or blackmailing in

352
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:34,070
this case there were telling us that

353
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:36,519
they were going to infect other programs

354
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:39,678
and what we see is that there's

355
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:42,679
pyramidal effect and the users can

356
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,230
infect other users meaning that at the

357
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,659
end of the day some will have to pay and

358
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,429
we've also seen the exfiltration of

359
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:52,039
datum for extortion if they are not

360
00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:55,340
asking for ransom to unblock the

361
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,859
equipment but in order not to publish in

362
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,809
data or information on the equipment so

363
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:05,570
in this case is an attack against the

364
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:09,799
confidentiality and privacy as you can

365
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:13,519
see there is a wide range of techniques

366
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:18,129
and all these techniques are very

367
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,129
profitable for cyber criminals

368
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:24,950
okay I provided you with a general

369
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:27,199
overview on the techniques for

370
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,940
technologies and the promise associated

371
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,380
to ransomware and this one I like to

372
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,870
describe to you the technique we've

373
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:37,130
developed for the early detection of

374
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:39,679
known or unknown ransomware and not only

375
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,380
to detect it but also to blocked it and

376
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,330
interrupt it as fast as possible and I'm

377
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,860
going to now give the floor to Lucia

378
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:50,449
she's going to take over the

379
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:53,300
presentation as Jose Antonio has said we

380
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:57,200
focused on encrypted ransomware

381
00:22:53,300 --> 00:23:01,480
more and harmful ransomware once they

382
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:05,600
infect our files if we don't have the

383
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:10,400
private keys we won't be able to decrypt

384
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,709
so we need to be able to detect it and

385
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,100
blocked and ransomware before that

386
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:19,550
encryption takes place so we decide an

387
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:22,909
early detection of ransomware based on

388
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:26,149
honey files honey files is the name

389
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:30,410
we've wanted to give to our trap we've

390
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:32,800
called this tool our blocker which is

391
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:36,710
like a pawn between ransomware and

392
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:39,800
locking and here you can see the system

393
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,200
architecture our traps for honey files

394
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,080
are distributed across the entire system

395
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,230
of files strategically placed or

396
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,149
position so that ransomware accesses

397
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:55,310
those traps where honey files before

398
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:59,870
files and these traps are infinite files

399
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:02,870
or loops meaning that a loop is created

400
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:06,020
and we have time to detect it we have

401
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:09,620
time to block it we have time to report

402
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:12,760
the intrusion and we also have time to

403
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:16,879
implement the necessary countermeasures

404
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:20,690
so we want our system to block the

405
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,970
ransomware not to affect the valuable

406
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:29,820
files

407
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:32,070
the user is reported encounter measures

408
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:36,179
are implemented this is a conceptual

409
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:39,030
model and can be exported to any

410
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:44,850
platform are the system requirement is

411
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:47,190
to be efficient and effective is it give

412
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:51,419
results in relation to run somewhere and

413
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:55,320
it does not corrupt our files is it be

414
00:24:51,420 --> 00:25:01,160
low consumption that users do not have

415
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:05,250
to devote many resources from the system

416
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:14,340
or embedded systems in the internet of

417
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:17,760
things so not too much memory it does

418
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:21,770
not it shouldn't need special privilege

419
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:25,620
it should be transparent and simple

420
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:28,710
simplicity makes it more attractive as a

421
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:33,479
conceptual test we have developed this

422
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:36,210
idea the UNIX based on Linux once we see

423
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:41,810
that it works and that it can be

424
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:46,410
extrapolated to other systems we are now

425
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:51,929
working on it we still have to see how

426
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:55,790
do we create those tricks first we

427
00:25:51,930 --> 00:26:00,120
thought about an infinite file but he

428
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:03,710
consumes too much too many resources so

429
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:09,949
we thought about zooming simulating

430
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:16,160
infinite files simulating the ransomware

431
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:19,350
library we should get to know ransomware

432
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,810
behaviors based on the signature so it's

433
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,639
not possible we finally came to the idea

434
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:27,759
of doing with fixed channel

435
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:33,620
[Music]

436
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:35,870
they are processes of reading

437
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:39,949
synchronized breathing and writing

438
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:46,610
processes these could comply with our

439
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:49,100
requirements why did we sell elect FIF

440
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:52,039
else they are files that exist in the

441
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:54,649
system with a naman hierarchy we can

442
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:58,610
refer to them as normal files it allowed

443
00:26:54,649 --> 00:27:01,939
to communicate non related processes of

444
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:06,139
writing and reading they do not have to

445
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:09,070
be related processes is persistent once

446
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:13,490
the process is acting on the FIFO its

447
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:16,639
goes on working and finally the most

448
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:19,519
important is synchronization of regional

449
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:23,889
writing processes in this image you can

450
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:27,980
clearly see the function we create a

451
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:31,149
channel or a pathway where we start a

452
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,129
writing process that is never eliminated

453
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:37,459
when a write in person or a reading

454
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:39,740
process comes in the run somewhere it

455
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:44,210
will read what is inside this channel

456
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:47,960
because his infinite is gets blocked at

457
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:50,570
that time at our process realises that

458
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,710
they are accessing it and we can

459
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:58,700
implement the countermeasures this could

460
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:01,549
be used to any ransomware if they

461
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,919
because they have in common that if they

462
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:06,500
want to cipher us they will have to open

463
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:11,059
up the file and when they open up the

464
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:15,679
file we can detect them this is a simple

465
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:18,889
chant about the system to the right we

466
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:25,009
will have our tool that has two

467
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:27,709
processes to reboot the environment once

468
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:32,060
you have the application the tool

469
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:34,660
we would install the Hani file and I

470
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:40,010
will explain how they are distributed

471
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:45,890
and we create the processes on this

472
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:51,050
channel the writing process once

473
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:58,610
ransomware is read the reading process

474
00:28:51,050 --> 00:29:02,210
we created and blocks itself so we are

475
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:08,590
not using too many resources we just

476
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:14,450
have to execute the order of executing

477
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:19,490
the intrusion and eliminated so we kill

478
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:24,200
the ransomware process how do we deploy

479
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:28,190
the honey files as we said we don't want

480
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,990
them to use too many resources we cannot

481
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:36,320
distribute any files all over the

482
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:39,620
directory to guarantee to guarantee that

483
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:48,129
nothing will happen so what we do is to

484
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:48,129
create one single file with links

485
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:55,970
we're not using too much memory and

486
00:29:52,430 --> 00:30:01,360
we're not using hard disk memory those

487
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:04,160
links are strategically located so that

488
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,030
the ransomware when getting to the

489
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:09,140
directory

490
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:11,389
this is the first finally ransomware my

491
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,630
rate is cousin attractive name some

492
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:19,040
ransomware are based on file extension

493
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:22,480
or file names what are the benefits of

494
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:27,760
our tool the are Locker

495
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:30,250
ransomware becomes fully blocked

496
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,850
countermeasures are launched

497
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:37,490
automatically the write-in unblocks

498
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:40,010
itself without the system monitor

499
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:43,130
encounter measures are implemented then

500
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:46,760
it does not consume resources and it

501
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:50,930
does not affect the rest of files if the

502
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:54,470
users open fi fo the message would only

503
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:56,600
be a file cannot be opened this is just

504
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:01,780
an image to give you an idea of our

505
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:07,639
prototype where we see a process in

506
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:13,010
background and is simulating we executed

507
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:18,140
ransomware in a virtual machine and this

508
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:22,010
was the message the warning and we

509
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:29,630
decided whether to launch the process or

510
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:32,300
not the experiment was first devoted to

511
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,730
the channel to see whether we could

512
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:41,840
control their reading and writing

513
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:47,690
processes then we use bash ransomware as

514
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,240
a concept trial based on open source we

515
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:55,490
developed this

516
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:58,880
first in linux and we use the concept in

517
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:02,170
a trial to check it worked and then we

518
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,690
moved to real test I will show you now a

519
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:08,180
brief video and then we could see that

520
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:12,050
he didn't affect the rest of the

521
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:16,550
problems that were being executed the

522
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:19,580
most common test because the worker I

523
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:23,240
had such an impact this year and in

524
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:25,639
order to simulate it in our environment

525
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:39,140
we use my intelligence the Windows

526
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:48,350
environment and this is a brief video so

527
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:55,600
we downloaded the sample wanna cry this

528
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:59,270
is the program we created a folder that

529
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:03,889
is hidden but you can see it the name is

530
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:10,250
my dear we started the process and we

531
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:14,690
left to turn our background screen then

532
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:20,540
we have the Hani file the real fi fo and

533
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:23,390
we created a symbolic link we created

534
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,970
some files in the directory together to

535
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:29,090
see whether they can cipher it or not we

536
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:36,020
execute wine simulating a Windows

537
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:40,669
environment and we execute wanna cry it

538
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:44,540
takes some time it has to download all

539
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:47,990
the files and the first directory is

540
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:51,170
being cipher because the Hana file is

541
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:54,309
not the first first there's a warning

542
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:59,849
about all processes

543
00:33:54,309 --> 00:34:04,418
and I get a notification we eliminated

544
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:08,129
and here we will see information about

545
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:12,059
one a crime that is accessing the FI FL

546
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:15,368
if we go to documents we see that he

547
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:18,309
didn't reach the documents directory

548
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:20,349
because the wanna cry started by the

549
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:25,059
desktop although it's not always the

550
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:27,460
case and we see didn't get any of the

551
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:31,599
directory funds it was just under

552
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:37,750
desktop and we see all the files that

553
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:43,149
was unloaded and if we kill the process

554
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:46,750
sort of say they process stops updated

555
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:53,759
sometimes so that you can see that it

556
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:53,760
can no longer cipher the files

557
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:08,910
this will be fully Sanford

558
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:23,859
and because is trapped in the first file

559
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:30,960
in the link in the directory it couldn't

560
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:34,000
go one rich in the rest of the files and

561
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,849
we see that those documents or files

562
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,849
have not been suffered

563
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:58,609
now our results were the following yes

564
00:35:55,099 --> 00:36:01,220
ransomware was blocked we had enough

565
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:05,540
time to kill the process storage

566
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:12,078
resources needed were only 2 K because

567
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:18,558
that the FIF l found some space system

568
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:21,380
requirements are super small the process

569
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:25,369
is stopped is not using any of the

570
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:29,900
busiest resources response time could be

571
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:32,809
500 to 800 milliseconds is fully

572
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:40,849
transparent to the users and the idea is

573
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:44,510
very simple once we tested and we see it

574
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:50,660
works we said we're now going to test it

575
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:56,960
in systems very much used by users and

576
00:36:50,660 --> 00:37:01,640
we are doing test 400 and window hundred

577
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,579
is not a OS it's a layer on top of it so

578
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:08,348
it does not have all possibilities as an

579
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:12,589
open source as Linux we had problems in

580
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:15,170
creating the symbolic link the F iff I

581
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:19,069
had to be a resultant directory we can

582
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:23,540
do it at the Android kernel and if we

583
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:28,339
program it it might have to work about

584
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:30,890
the future about deployment and those

585
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:34,849
are our current projects we are

586
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:37,690
continuing with the project we need to

587
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:40,430
guarantee a coherent deployment of the

588
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,890
system but maybe the uses might make a

589
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,058
mistake and we should take all those

590
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:47,629
things into account

591
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:51,740
so that the system is really up and

592
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:56,950
running they functionalities automatic

593
00:37:51,740 --> 00:38:01,149
process management through database we

594
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:05,230
determine whether the program

595
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:10,799
spinning or not whether it updates the

596
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:15,039
database to eliminate Marvel files and

597
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:20,170
to use it in other platforms Android

598
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:23,500
would be possible and also Mac OS and

599
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:25,450
we're still working on Windows and is a

600
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:30,400
very good proposal if it works because

601
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:34,259
almost all users are using or are

602
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:37,720
Windows users as conclusions is an

603
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:41,859
innovative methodology with very good

604
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:47,078
results and will based on a feature that

605
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:50,490
is common to all run some where the tool

606
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:54,369
is being designed that complies with the

607
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:57,009
requirements we have implemented it in

608
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:59,049
Linux and then we've studied the

609
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:02,470
possibility of implementing it in other

610
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:05,619
platform with comparative results and it

611
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:07,959
has given even better results than

612
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:10,349
expected and thank you so much if you

613
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,349
have any

614
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,060
you
