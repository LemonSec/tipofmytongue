good afternoon good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:31,240
welcome to this last workshop today

3
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:33,629
Saturday my name is Francisco I'm a

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,670
member of ain't even and I'm here to

5
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:43,809
talk to you about privacy and anonymity

6
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:45,760
and the Internet fundamentals of pro

7
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:48,940
browser I don't know how many of you

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,720
have you said please raise your hand if

9
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:58,390
that's the case of your used row browser

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:01:01,870
before begin I like to state that this

11
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,710
presentation has been prepared for

12
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:09,820
educational prisoners and I waive all

13
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:15,699
responsibility as I was saying I'm a

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:19,919
member of even hold a master's in this

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:23,050
field I devote my activities to criminal

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,780
investigations and cyber space and I

17
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:33,340
have participated in many conferences

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:40,390
cyber camp among others when we hear

19
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:42,640
about t OU arm and the media what comes

20
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,920
to your mind when we talk about T or

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,200
well the negative side to its cyber

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:55,360
crime and they often forget about the

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:58,330
more positive part of it and I'm going

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,399
to start with a definition of the

25
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,399
typical description of this project

26
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,899
the room was used to the Internet and we

27
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,060
constantly shared information on

28
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:14,560
ourselves and our private lives on the

29
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:17,530
Internet what we eat what we read where

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,150
we go let me explain this better to you

31
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,690
if someone wants to learn something

32
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:25,239
about you this person could be able to

33
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,420
know what your OS is or the web pages

34
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:31,060
you've served the browser you use and

35
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,369
much more information about you that

36
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,069
you're probably willing to share of

37
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,640
course with strangers however if you use

38
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:42,010
T o R this will not be the case tor

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,029
browser protects your privacy and

40
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,950
integrity and the internet and it

41
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,950
secures your data through three

42
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,380
encryption layers and send this

43
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,250
encrypted throughout the planet this

44
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,980
allows us to communicate anonymously the

45
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,220
internet terror attacks are data from

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,349
the massive surveillance by governments

47
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,600
and companies maybe you live in a

48
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,310
repressive country that tries to control

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,220
the internet or maybe you don't want

50
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:17,980
major corporations to use your personal

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:20,739
details to you are renters all user ISM

52
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,440
and make them all look the same

53
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,230
gives you anonymity the more people that

54
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,519
use the T or network the better because

55
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:33,940
it's easier to hide a group of people

56
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:37,120
that seem the same yes you can avoid

57
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,859
censorship censors won't know what

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,239
you're doing on the Internet

59
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:46,239
pants won't follow you for months after

60
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,569
clicking once on a project on a product

61
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,549
by using to you are websites you visit

62
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,798
won't know who you are and from where

63
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:57,130
you're surfing unless you tell them who

64
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,530
you are by downloading and using to you

65
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:03,549
are you're protecting those people that

66
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:09,709
need anonymity for example bloggers your

67
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:13,910
activates download and use ter this is

68
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:16,820
the message of the team of tio our

69
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:20,450
projects regarding the project let's

70
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,750
begin by describing the background of T

71
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:27,919
or R this comes from Onion Routing from

72
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:31,370
the Naval Observatory from the US then

73
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,130
it was sponsored by the e FF since 2005

74
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:37,700
and now it is known as to your our

75
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:42,440
project it's a not-for-profit initiative

76
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:44,690
for research purposes have you heard

77
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,600
about surface deep dark web are you

78
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:51,169
familiar with these terms surface deep

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:57,770
dark web I'll try to define each of them

80
00:04:51,169 --> 00:05:00,859
for you a surface web that's the

81
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:04,099
internet that we use on a daily basis in

82
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,800
our work in our activities ie the

83
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:13,070
internet that is indexed by the main and

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,650
just Google Yahoo Bing among others what

85
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:19,700
about Deep Web what's the Deep Web about

86
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:23,409
there's some sub field is accessible but

87
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:27,500
it's not indexed by these browsers ok

88
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:30,890
for example the content of your email

89
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,979
account let's imagine that the content

90
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:36,020
of our emails would be indexed by

91
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,210
browsers or that the info and your

92
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,030
corporate sites would be indexed you

93
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,700
imagine that unless we have the

94
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:47,179
so-called dark web

95
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:51,409
ie that which is restricted and essent

96
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,930
indexed by browsers but you are this is

97
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:58,100
not the cases we will see we'll see how

98
00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:01,789
we can access the info stored in the tio

99
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,870
our hidden services without using to

100
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:04,870
your browser

101
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:13,950
and here you can see food or definition

102
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:18,780
for deep web we could include dynamic

103
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:22,800
web pages corporate site info blog pages

104
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:27,869
or pages with restricted access like

105
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,720
emails Oh burning ember coin named ko

106
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,390
and among others sites that are in link

107
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,420
to or documents that have a non

108
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,180
indexable format or those for which you

109
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:43,230
need highly specific a series of

110
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:46,590
criteria in the case of the dark web in

111
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:49,710
order to access the TR network you need

112
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,549
the tor browser but this isn't a hundred

113
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:57,950
percent accurate as we will see what

114
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:01,980
about onion addresses the hidden service

115
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:04,469
service the hidden service uh well we

116
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,960
have version two made up of letters from

117
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:11,790
a to set and numbers from 2 to 7 and 17

118
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,390
characters this has changed after

119
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:19,800
version 3 was implemented in this case

120
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:23,969
we're talking about addresses from ages

121
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,890
said times 56 characters these are the

122
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,990
ones who've used up until now and these

123
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:32,729
are the ones we will use from now

124
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:35,400
onwards we currently use both now as I

125
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,440
was saying version 3 is already up and

126
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,130
running

127
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:45,450
as I mentioned earlier we can access the

128
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:50,280
content the Tor network and onion

129
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:55,110
services from the web surface yes we can

130
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:58,229
my using some applications and that

131
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,170
allow us to access directly to the

132
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:04,680
content of the tour we have from this

133
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:08,460
surface how well by adding to the onion

134
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,590
address the extension dot T u dot city

135
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:15,549
dot length on cap among others

136
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:18,549
what happens with this well this means

137
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:24,160
that we don't have to him stole hotel

138
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:26,830
browser but the downside is that we find

139
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,620
ourselves in a situation in which we can

140
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,199
access to the tour I was from the

141
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,669
surface web and of course this is

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,380
subject to around somewhere are you

143
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,270
familiar with the concept ransomware

144
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,909
wanna cry have you ever heard about

145
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,039
wanna try there are other forms of

146
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:44,110
ransomware that can infect equipment

147
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,480
they provide us with an address of this

148
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,700
kind so that they user they don't have

149
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,650
the tor browser can access a really to

150
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:55,060
the payment channel so they position

151
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,449
themselves in our equipment and the

152
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,209
hidden service and the promise that they

153
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:03,580
can and see what you're doing there in

154
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,880
the middle of the communication there in

155
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,580
between and they see the hidden service

156
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,150
you're connecting to they use DNS

157
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:16,690
meaning that they'll know where you're

158
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:20,260
getting connected and the size the

159
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,210
u-verse it will be known to them and of

160
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,580
course

161
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:27,760
forget about privacy and anonymity when

162
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:31,360
using these services because this is

163
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:38,740
what the Tor network provides us with by

164
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:41,020
using lead T or browser however to your

165
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,880
is not the only anonymity that provides

166
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,220
us with anonymity there are more sighs

167
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,660
phone to your we have free net Network

168
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:56,980
and I to pi/2 P have you heard about it

169
00:09:49,660 --> 00:10:00,280
free net I to P but today we're only

170
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,490
going to focus on T there are other

171
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,550
networks that are working progress a

172
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:11,610
coordinate R if flip Eber Borya or

173
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,609
series 0 net lantern among others

174
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,720
what distributions includes our browser

175
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:27,170
or provide us with privacy and anonymity

176
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:30,050
I've mentioned 3q u u b SF unix and

177
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,209
tails have you heard about them you're

178
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,949
probably familiar with tails tails is

179
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:39,080
probably the one that has received more

180
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:41,450
coverage so we installed the ridge file

181
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,400
command the virtual machine and we have

182
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:47,000
the environment we need an order to

183
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,890
serve in an anonymous and private way of

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,910
course we also have hardware that

185
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:55,640
provides us with privacy and anonymity

186
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:58,250
we have reuters that allow us to connect

187
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:03,490
ourselves to the eto our network and use

188
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:06,800
VPN services and sometimes we can use

189
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,720
raspberry pi like the onion pie project

190
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,530
all the connections that go to the

191
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,300
device are included through the internet

192
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,430
and on the internet you have a lot of

193
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:23,839
information explaining how you can do

194
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:27,319
this to your and mobile phones it's also

195
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:32,450
possible in Android and also in is

196
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:35,990
what's most common orbit which is the TR

197
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:39,110
of Android or our books also from our

198
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,960
our Android and in iOS we have the onion

199
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:45,470
browser so it's not only to you are we

200
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:52,400
can also use them this technology in our

201
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:55,870
mobile phones what other services are

202
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,850
provided by the T or network not only

203
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,490
avocation but also applications like

204
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,680
onion share I explain this later that is

205
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,540
basically something that allows us to

206
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,670
share files and

207
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:14,529
twere messenger for messaging or in

208
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:21,639
Gucci and some email services like tor

209
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:25,899
box let's take a look at the

210
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:28,420
technologies that help us ensure privacy

211
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,189
and anonymity is not only to our there

212
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:35,050
are other technologies out there like

213
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:39,809
VPN or proxies as well that can be used

214
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:43,120
to prevent censorship in the Internet to

215
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:47,370
serve as a bypass or circumvent

216
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:52,930
geographic limited geographic asset

217
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:58,209
access here we have an example of a

218
00:12:52,930 --> 00:13:01,120
proxy proxies are intermediate equipment

219
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:02,229
between us and the end device to which

220
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,149
we can a we have

221
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:09,100
HTTP server Sox and these can be public

222
00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:12,399
on the Internet these days there are

223
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,040
many many majors that providers with

224
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,230
proxy addresses with reports however are

225
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,099
we going to trust those addresses where

226
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:26,319
do they come from and the other hand we

227
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:29,230
have a private paid for services what's

228
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:35,459
it downside they cannot collect negative

229
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:40,269
info and navigation and also access to

230
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:43,649
requests let's move on to the first

231
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,649
practical exercise

232
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,290
where can we obtain and find these kind

233
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,290
of proxies

234
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:34,279
let's see this is one of the many pages

235
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,250
available in the earning internet to

236
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,750
download proxy files here we have them

237
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:43,160
distributed or broke it down by

238
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:45,010
countries and also by protocol and also

239
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,980
depending on the level of anonymity

240
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:55,939
non-anonymous high anonymity and he have

241
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:59,810
the full list okay it's just a matter of

242
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:03,410
setting this in your browser and start

243
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:05,270
using it of course so so no matter

244
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:14,449
whether you're going to trust this info

245
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:17,529
or not there are also web proxies like a

246
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,529
proxy dot-com

247
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:31,450
this allows us to choose among older

248
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:43,050
servers to the public service so let's

249
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:43,050
select one if we go to me BES

250
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,430
this is the address of the proxy this

251
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,859
means that we would be navigating

252
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,430
through a web proxy what would be my

253
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:01,240
real address

254
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:03,939
this is the real IP address and where

255
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:10,139
the proxy as you can see it's different

256
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:17,279
it's a different address you can use

257
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:17,279
whatever server provided by this people

258
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:32,850
we also have this um browser and I'll

259
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,849
select

260
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:48,060
does this ring a bell start page it

261
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:52,970
provides us with navigation through

262
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,969
proxy if I enter the same pages earlier

263
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:06,690
take a look here we have the proxy

264
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:09,829
option so simple as that it would make a

265
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,830
request to the server

266
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:24,110
and here it is here we are as you can

267
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,150
see there are different ways of using

268
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:30,419
proxies let's move on to the next

269
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:33,000
practice this one here we have one of

270
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,070
the many plugins of Firefox in order to

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:44,190
change address for example the best

272
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:48,540
proxy switcher here it is basically we

273
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:50,870
download it from the Firefox plug-in

274
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,870
repository

275
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,420
every five minutes they update this for

276
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:29,400
example here we have one from Spain from

277
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,400
Alicante to be more exact

278
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:55,050
let's check it out 62 14 168 22 there it

279
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:57,810
is there are a great deal there are many

280
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:01,340
you basically look for the one that

281
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,340
suits you best

282
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,270
that's move on

283
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:25,370
as for VPNs I recommend you to use them

284
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:30,860
whenever you connect yourself to public

285
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:34,280
websites that can endanger our

286
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:39,949
communication so what the VPN does is

287
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:41,990
hide our real IP address the server to

288
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,500
which we're going to connect receives

289
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:49,420
the VPN IP address ourselves ago to

290
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:52,910
encrypt communication as we can see and

291
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:57,340
flowcharts are equipment the VPM and

292
00:19:52,910 --> 00:20:00,620
then the info would flow unencrypted

293
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,080
what's the problem with our VPNs well

294
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,800
this part here the fact that they can

295
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,590
store the logs some weeks ago they

296
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:13,909
arrested us cyber criminal because the

297
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:16,340
VPN provider disseminated the logs of

298
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:27,320
our provider that wasn't storing the

299
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:33,050
logs are you familiar with on the

300
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:36,110
browser opera yes Oprah has a VPN

301
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:39,520
service embedded you're worth it yes

302
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,520
well let's take a look at it

303
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,490
here it is

304
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:09,290
the upper part you can see the VPN I can

305
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:17,030
it's not enabled

306
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:19,770
there are several ok Canada the US

307
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:23,430
Germany and the Netherlands in Singapore

308
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:27,240
let's select one the German one it's

309
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:32,790
already enabled and the IP is here 185

310
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:35,400
to 127 151 104 and here we have another

311
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:38,000
website let's take a look at the IP

312
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,000
address

313
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:53,170
[Music]

314
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,139
we have some problems

315
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:18,160
connectionists and working let's choose

316
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:21,490
this one here it is you can see the IP

317
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:28,120
address there and the one detected by

318
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:31,179
the server right remember this will only

319
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,699
changed the address in our web

320
00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:36,160
navigation it doesn't affect the other

321
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:40,900
services we may be using it only affects

322
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:44,130
than browser of course we can choose

323
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:47,830
this free option or higher one of the

324
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:50,230
many VPN services available on the

325
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:54,789
Internet in to this end I've brought a

326
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:57,820
list with you with the top 10 vpm top 10

327
00:22:54,789 --> 00:23:05,408
VPN calm as the website where you will

328
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:10,510
be able to find this this is one of the

329
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:14,350
many that exists and here you have a

330
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:18,940
good comparative analysis and there are

331
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,500
scores given to each a one so that well

332
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,770
you can choose the one that suits you

333
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,770
best

334
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:47,669
and now let's continue one we've seen in

335
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:50,970
the proxies the VPN we move on to to

336
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:53,549
your which is the goal of this workshop

337
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:57,500
of this presentation what's the main

338
00:23:53,549 --> 00:24:02,039
advantage of T or as we said to provide

339
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:05,070
privacy and anonymity and of course the

340
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:07,440
communication will be encrypted how does

341
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:12,418
it work we are there and then we have

342
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:16,440
the destination follower the Tor network

343
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:20,940
is made up of three steps on entry and

344
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:24,779
intermediate and exit how is the M for

345
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:29,159
the data encrypted first it's encrypted

346
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:33,240
with the public key or password of the

347
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:36,389
exit code logo then the intermediate

348
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,620
node and finally with the public key of

349
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:44,010
the entry note and that's how we build

350
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:47,459
of the three onion layers of the tea or

351
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:50,519
network how do we decode afterwards

352
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:55,470
while following the opposite process the

353
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:57,750
first note with a private key second

354
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,600
note private key a third node private

355
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:03,269
key and we remove all three onion layers

356
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,519
what happens with this well since we

357
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:07,860
removed the three onion layer as the

358
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,740
info we have an implement of the

359
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:14,189
necessary means after the neck last node

360
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:18,450
will be unencrypted as we will see in

361
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:21,929
the next slide there you can see in the

362
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:25,480
MM image of the three layers what's the

363
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:28,720
problem with that your network well it's

364
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:33,450
slow in terms of navigation and there's

365
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,450
the problem with the exit node

366
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:42,779
how are circuits made into your circuit

367
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:47,979
is made up of three and nodes by default

368
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:50,620
first the keys for each node each info

369
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,679
goes through this circuit circuits can

370
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,649
last 10 minutes but this can be changed

371
00:25:52,679 --> 00:26:01,630
and then we have a list with several

372
00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:04,268
circuits into yours and browser here you

373
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:07,779
can see the problem with the exit or

374
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:10,929
outgoing note there we have the entry

375
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:15,700
node intermediate node and between the

376
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:19,840
final and/or exit node and the final

377
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:22,510
note the information is unencrypted what

378
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,559
happens if we sniff traffic here what

379
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:30,970
happened what happens well all the

380
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:35,168
traffic that is and encrypted can be

381
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:38,860
accessed and this is one of the reasons

382
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:44,049
why I do our browser includes a plugging

383
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:51,668
of HTTPS so that the info is encrypted

384
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:54,720
until the final research here we have

385
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:59,080
the plugin included by to your browser

386
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:01,299
HTTP was another way around how can we

387
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,760
prevent this for is heavenly using VPN

388
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:09,330
on on tea or or two are on a VPN either

389
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,330
option

390
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:17,540
the combination we can connect ourselves

391
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,460
through the tor network to the VPN

392
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,540
server and the next to the service or

393
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,340
the other way around

394
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:29,000
first we connect to our BPM servers skip

395
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:38,990
to to your network or three notes and

396
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:45,050
then connect to the end service as I

397
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:47,180
mentioned the circuit one sweded uses

398
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,399
several node so that you are networking

399
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:54,010
to knows her public and now we're going

400
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:58,220
to see where that info can be but before

401
00:27:54,010 --> 00:28:00,470
that will lead to our project info we

402
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,840
can create the map that I'm going to

403
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:06,040
show you now which is called to your

404
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,040
float or flow

405
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:46,750
Gargano Columbia we are just loading on

406
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:50,890
the information using 3G and he's gonna

407
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:58,380
show the traffic among the different

408
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:58,380
nodes in the network in the T or network

409
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:14,260
is here we are now as I said the address

410
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:22,120
are public with the exception of bridge

411
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:27,100
nodes copolymers so we can have an idea

412
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:31,800
about the countries where the teo our

413
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,800
network is present

414
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:50,810
are you qualified did you know about to

415
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:53,840
our flow any of you we shouldn't think

416
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:55,280
that poor flow and height and services

417
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,629
are the same they are two completely

418
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,629
different things

419
00:30:06,049 --> 00:30:12,679
the door flow and hidden services aren't

420
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,679
two completely different things

421
00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:30,289
shall we continue then where can we get

422
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:35,158
the list of to our notes and the page

423
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:36,649
tio our stages it takes some time to be

424
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,899
loaded

425
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:47,699
but this is one of the directories that

426
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:56,389
we can use here you are to our status we

427
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:56,389
can download the list in CCV format

428
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:14,428
terrible it takes some time to be loaded

429
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:19,918
and here we are here we are the name of

430
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:24,299
each node the bandwidth the time on the

431
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,879
hostname and even the vlogs or type of

432
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:34,259
services were talking about the weather

433
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:37,918
entry intermediate exit and at the end

434
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:43,049
of the list we can do a filtering if we

435
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:48,840
want to filter by any of the data I

436
00:31:43,049 --> 00:32:00,769
believe there will be around 7000 here

437
00:31:48,840 --> 00:32:00,769
you are exit node today 708

438
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:13,439
here we have 6730 tea and 33

439
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:25,719
come on beep oh I forgot I said you can

440
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:28,899
get all this information not only these

441
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:33,369
wheels I have to our matrix page where

442
00:32:28,899 --> 00:32:36,189
we can get information about this

443
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:42,189
project information provided by the

444
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:45,539
company itself to our matrix here we

445
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:49,389
have interesting information

446
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:52,769
how many onion sites do you think do you

447
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:59,709
have how many onion addresses there are

448
00:32:52,769 --> 00:33:03,519
other millions of that onion sites we

449
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:06,039
usually see the iceberg when speaking

450
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,639
about that you are Network we are not

451
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:15,700
going to see the iceberg today but

452
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:18,820
according to the project you are the

453
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:25,419
number of dot onion sites is the

454
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:32,399
following that you can see in this

455
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:32,399
screen it will be around 60,000 or more

456
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:40,539
we're speaking about not services but

457
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:43,600
sides each of the site can give more

458
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:47,230
than one service but here according to

459
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:54,609
this data today we have around 60

460
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:57,940
something addresses dot onion did you

461
00:33:54,609 --> 00:34:01,739
think they were more or less for me

462
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,739
those are the most reliable data

463
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:11,360
when I park your the kotappa okay you

464
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:13,668
can visit this website that provides

465
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:18,140
very interesting information if you want

466
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:20,679
to know this about this network shall we

467
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,679
go on then

468
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:36,429
the rather imprecision proxy in proxy

469
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:42,370
and out proxy Network what is an imp

470
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:47,250
Roxy network the first allows us to

471
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:50,350
browse using the anonymous network and

472
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:53,139
go to internet this is what we're going

473
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:56,650
to be doing any well but the in proxy

474
00:34:53,139 --> 00:35:01,140
networks only allow us to browse within

475
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:05,200
the network services

476
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:07,720
TR is an imp Roxie and out proxy Network

477
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,750
it allows us to browse through the

478
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:15,000
internal network services that onion but

479
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:25,320
it also allow us to serve the internet

480
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:29,320
to the superficial internet layer we

481
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:37,090
always speak about the D or as if it was

482
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:41,950
a website this is not the case we can

483
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:50,410
have any services based on TCP protocol

484
00:35:41,950 --> 00:36:01,720
not only HTTP HTTP FTP telnet pop3 SMTP

485
00:35:50,410 --> 00:36:09,040
jabber XM MP IRC SSH Welton we deploy

486
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:15,129
those hum hidden services from computer

487
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:19,600
at home or in a raspberry or using

488
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:22,270
different VPS providers / RTO are

489
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:27,870
friendly and allow the deployment of

490
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:27,870
those services or cloud services

491
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:40,380
browser leaks does it ring a bell

492
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:46,390
do you all have your smartphone with you

493
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:50,970
can you go and do this site browser

494
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:55,109
leaks we'll say what is the information

495
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:57,759
we live when connecting to a web server

496
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:17,399
let us go there

497

498
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,210
this is the information we give every

499
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:29,340
time we access this type of web services

500
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:32,320
in relation to the IP Forex for instance

501
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:36,790
look all this information that we live

502
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:39,060
in from the IP address they get

503
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,960
information about our geo called

504
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:44,200
localization you might not be too

505
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,180
accurate but we should take into account

506
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,319
that I'm using the smart phone

507
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,319
[Music]

508
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,430
have a look at all this information

509
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:17,950
of course now I'm not using any type of

510
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:23,730
proxy nor VPN or to earth so I'm just

511
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:27,960
using the real IP address provided by

512
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,960
the service provider

513
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:41,900
you can browse using the lateral menu

514
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:47,960
where you can see word additional

515
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:50,500
information JavaScript in case it's

516
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,500
active

517
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:16,308
so they get our fingerprint are browsing

518
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:16,309
fingerprint print fingerprint

519
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,210
vamos me another photo device RB let us

520
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:31,059
go and see some other additional

521
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:38,529
services do you know about Sudan please

522
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:41,109
raise your hand we have a sedan for the

523
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:46,630
TR network there is the following

524
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:57,460
service let's see if it works it's not

525
00:39:46,630 --> 00:40:03,190
working ok so it's not working

526
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:05,950
the name is onion investigator what they

527
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:09,849
do is look for onion address and

528
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:14,049
scanning their port we had all the onion

529
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:17,460
address and all the active services but

530
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:17,460
it is not working today

531
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:40,440
the riddle about the fingerprint we have

532
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:43,709
the following service I am unique that

533
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,619
gives information about how unique we

534
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:50,160
are in relation to the signatures they

535
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:56,510
have in their database so you can try I

536
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,509
am unique this what you have the type

537
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:10,229
before them

538
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,680
niggas I'm gonna see em

539
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:27,640
I think I've lost my internet connection

540
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,640
the speaker says

541
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:33,259
and yeah

542
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:49,109
punt or peridot dot Oh Jean a my unique

543
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:52,950
dot o-r-g so LaMacchia

544
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:56,069
if we go to view my browser fingerprint

545
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,720
let us press it so we know how unique we

546
00:41:56,069 --> 00:42:02,480
are compared to the rest of the

547
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,480
fingerprint hosted in the database

548
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,070
Oh chuckles Oh tada let us see how long

549
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:24,990
it takes wasn't done

550
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,990
do you have any results have you tried

551
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:45,170
well what is the answer they do they say

552
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:52,200
that you're unique among all signatures

553
00:42:45,170 --> 00:43:00,900
here we have the result yes you can be

554
00:42:52,200 --> 00:43:04,189
tracked so this is quite an interesting

555
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:08,930
service to see how unique you are

556
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:11,910
compared to the rest of users that are

557
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:16,160
using the same service did you know the

558
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:16,160
service I am unique any of you

559
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:27,600
well I'm out on about so let us go to to

560
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,600
our

561
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,420
kamar service as I said at the beginning

562
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:49,340
whenever we speak about your network

563
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:53,569
what do we find what you can see in the

564
00:43:49,340 --> 00:44:01,160
screen is always related to harassment

565
00:43:53,570 --> 00:44:03,500
crimes interest by criminals but they

566
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,368
sometimes forget about the main purpose

567
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:12,530
of those networks which is to provide

568
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:15,380
anonymity and privacy to escape from

569
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:18,890
censorship but of course there is the

570
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:22,600
criminal side there but one use it to

571
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:27,589
commit their crimes what I always saying

572
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:34,839
is that we shouldn't consider technology

573
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:34,840
just by the misuse by some for example

574
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:43,390
with other applications as whatsapp or

575
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:52,010
telegram do you use whatsapp or telegram

576
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:54,589
it is not a wassup user we my punish

577
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:57,740
those technologies would we do it

578
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:01,070
because there are also some crimes

579
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:08,319
committed in the yourself wassup this

580
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:16,600
year the dismantling of child abuse

581
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:19,580
networks or Isis information as you know

582
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:21,980
criminals are not only using those

583
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:27,500
applications as the to our network but

584
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:30,250
they also happen in those two messaging

585
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:33,590
systems if you come to our presentation

586
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:36,310
tomorrow you will see a presentation

587
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,310
about fraud

588
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:48,540
could see how crimes were committed the

589
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:50,839
surface web that we all use so you're

590
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:54,779
all invited if you're interested but

591
00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:58,020
you're all technologies it also has its

592
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:01,980
failures I don't know you know if you

593
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:05,730
heard about tor mobile it's not the only

594
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:10,260
one but this is the most recent one this

595
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:13,890
vulnerability exposes the real users

596
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:16,680
ideal which is exactly what the tor

597
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:23,810
browser tries to avoid this is due to

598
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:25,529
failure in managing the files in Firefox

599
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:28,440
what happened

600
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:33,240
the always connects directly without

601
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:38,970
going through to your so they can get

602
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:40,919
our real IP address this affected and my

603
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:43,410
speaking in past tense because it's no

604
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:47,060
longer the case to Linux and Mattox and

605
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:51,180
is corrected from the release seven

606
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:53,849
point nine is not the only vulnerability

607
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,040
there was another one in 2013 another

608
00:46:53,849 --> 00:47:00,930
one in 2016

609
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:04,740
especially next rotation of javascript

610
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:10,560
in the browser so they could the uses I

611
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:13,950
deem what is very important whenever we

612
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,790
use it your browser is to update it's

613
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:22,259
not only these but in old applications

614
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:25,910
we will get this warning or message you

615
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:25,910
have to update your browser

616
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:37,560
and I urge you to do so whenever you

617
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:42,570
find this message and this is the do our

618
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:44,670
browser itself there is already has

619
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:47,460
already all the settings just to be

620
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:53,070
downloaded and installed and executed

621
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:57,930
and then you go to do our network how

622
00:47:53,070 --> 00:48:01,400
can you get the application if we're

623
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:07,560
using Linux directly from the repository

624
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:10,110
with apt-get why um or we have other

625
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:17,759
sources for example through email

626
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:24,090
through XMPP protocol or directly from

627
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:32,550
Twitter we can do it from Twitter and

628
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:37,710
get your TR either using Mac Windows or

629
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:41,370
Linux and we will be able to carry on

630
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:43,860
with the download and especially with

631
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:50,970
the normal channel would be the project

632
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:56,390
website itself to download it is as easy

633
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:56,390
as go directly to the website

and we can then load it from here I can

642
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:44,160
help all of us for all releases now we

643

[Music]

656
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:37,869
we start and here we have the home page

657
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:40,580
we can test it and they say

658
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:43,609
congratulations this browser is

659
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:53,540
configured to use tor and here you have

660
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:59,920
the assigned IP address what are the

661
00:50:53,540 --> 00:51:04,640
settings we could go to security

662
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:08,930
settings by default the browser is at

663
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:13,879
the lowest level in 2016 there was a

664
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:17,240
JavaScript vulnerability and you had the

665
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:19,220
setting with this low level it was

666
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:24,229
vulnerable they could hack your IP

667
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:26,419
address but when you raise the level or

668
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:31,660
if you raise the level to the highest

669
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,660
security that is on everyone's choice

670
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:50,140
you see KC remote an you know if we

671
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:59,170
wanted to make it portable with the USB

672
00:51:50,140 --> 00:52:06,069
it'll be as easy as this we introduce

673
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:11,670
the USB through the slot so they are

674
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:11,670
heavy I think I have the excel file here

675
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:29,199
when installing it we could introduce

676
00:52:21,249 --> 00:52:31,509
the and the USB with and with this we

677
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:36,130
have enough we can take the browser

678
00:52:31,509 --> 00:52:38,910
wherever we go he's as simple as this it

679
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:38,910
takes some time

680
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:23,000
yes an Aikido photo in question maybe

681
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:28,180
why do we have two kinds in the picture

682
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,180
and I will explain wine

683
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:44,200
you just have to wait it would now be at

684
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:47,050
the USB we execute DT our browser and we

685
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:55,990
can browse your ready to browse that

686
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:59,440
song anti Rama de la I was just

687
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:05,080
beginning about the dice distribution we

688
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:10,330
can also loaded into a USB and is very

689
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:14,799
easy using Rufus application among many

690
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:16,840
others do you know about Rufus here you

691
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:22,290
can choose your preferred one for me

692
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:22,290
Rufus is quite simple and easy to use

693
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:32,009
once we have downloaded the is L this is

694
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:32,010
the Thais ISO

695
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:48,730
and with Rufus we just uploaded we

696
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:54,569
selected and US Route or Drive it will

697
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:54,570
be the u.s. beam it takes some time

698
00:55:11,859 --> 00:55:18,549
but vamos lá me open right we're gonna

699
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:24,249
use the same USB once we have selected

700
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:25,589
the is L we add the device is the only

701
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:29,589
one we have

702
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:32,230
and first they say they will erase all

703
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:35,259
data and then you can continue as you

704
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:39,009
see is quite simple then we should take

705
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:41,769
into account the booting sequence so

706
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:45,369
that it puts from the USB itself and

707
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:50,038
then we'll have the dice running we can

708
00:55:45,369 --> 00:55:50,039
also install it in a virtual machine

709
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:07,288
what about the cards I'm going to

710
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:10,199
introduce the onion share service that

711
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:12,989
allow us to share files through the to

712
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:18,779
our network is as simple as this once we

713
00:56:12,989 --> 00:56:24,660
have downloaded the executor to our

714
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:28,759
share we have a nikon in our desktop i'm

715
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,759
going to stop that you are browser now

716
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:42,270
the first thing is to connect to to our

717
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,270
network

718
00:56:55,609 --> 00:57:03,000
what is the next step the what are the

719
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:08,460
files we'll want to share we're going to

720
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:12,329
share the two cuts picture we just drug

721
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:14,400
it and then once we have the files we

722
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:17,940
turn on the server switch on the server

723
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,309
and we have an onion address that is the

724
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:23,359
one we have to share to the users that

725
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:23,359
will access the information

726
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:34,759
[Music]

727
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:50,640
you dick sometime also and here we are

728
00:57:54,860 --> 00:58:02,810
i Adama this is the IP oh this is the

729
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:06,080
address we have to share we pass it to

730
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:09,590
the user we can even set it so the the

731
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:11,600
first one that downloaded the services

732
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:14,870
will be interrupted or we can keep it

733
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:17,860
active as long as we wish as you see is

734
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:17,859
quite easy

735
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:36,470
or if we do the same thing with what we

736
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:39,950
do with a normal browser using tor

737
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:43,118
browser let's see what happens we open

738
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:43,118
do our browser

739
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,940
my dad

740
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:19,800
normally the honeybee came up ahead so

741
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:23,400
IP address um what can we see this

742
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:25,740
service will detect that we are exiting

743
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:31,290
through one of the exit nodes of the tio

744
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:34,620
our browser it tells us this and it

745
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:39,900
provides us with all the info regarding

746
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:42,470
the node it tells us that we are in

747
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,470
Romania

748
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:54,519
so once again with we've managed to mask

749
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:54,519
or hide our IP address

750
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:12,589
and that's now stir the last part and

751
01:00:10,289 --> 01:00:17,490
we'll do it from here

752
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:21,089
walking of tio are what happens if they

753
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:23,990
block our access to the tio our network

754
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:27,150
yes there are some options that can

755
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:33,558
allow us to circumvent or bypass this

756
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:37,799
block action um whenever they block the

757
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:41,789
addresses targeting the entry IPS we can

758
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:44,190
use bridge which allows us to issue a

759
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:46,019
request to to our project so that they

760
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:48,259
provide us with a series of addresses in

761
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:52,500
order to be able to connect ourselves

762
01:00:48,259 --> 01:00:55,230
because we've seen the entry addresses

763
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,759
out to our networks our products so

764
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:59,400
we're going to ask them for other

765
01:00:56,759 --> 01:01:04,470
addresses that are not blocked and we

766
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:07,410
can do it from their own website from

767
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:12,078
the to our project Network and the

768
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:12,078
section bridges how can we do this

769
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:28,299
I get that I'm off

770
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:32,868
you can sound all these hello fossil

771
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,540
baby okay here we go there serves you

772
01:01:32,869 --> 01:01:37,790
have to download to our browsers and

773
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:42,410
bridges and how we can add these

774
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:49,340
addresses so you can do this here we can

775
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:51,180
request the conventional ones or provide

776
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,750
us with a breacher

777
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:56,470
[Music]

778
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,470
you click on it

779
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:13,210
I'm pretty bad with camp chats and

780
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,210
there's the list

781
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:25,300
this bridge list can be set maybe to our

782
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:31,720
browser and this part here in this

783
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:36,820
section and we see they weren't able to

784
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:39,930
connect the configuration of the setting

785
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,930
would be as follows

786
01:02:47,520 --> 01:03:01,210
to our network settings and here we

787
01:02:54,460 --> 01:03:07,120
paste or do we have copied and press ok

788
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:11,610
and this would have already set the

789
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,609
bridges in Arkham browser

790
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:32,430
now let's continue I said connects well

791
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:34,500
it connects well there it is we're

792
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:36,690
already connected there's something I

793
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:39,420
didn't mention if you want to see the

794
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:44,400
circuit we've established you can see it

795
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:47,510
here see here it is we've connected it

796
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:51,410
through a bridge bridge France Romania

797
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:55,410
Internet there we have the circuit okay

798
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:58,140
we can even request a new circuit for

799
01:03:55,410 --> 01:04:05,399
this side let's do so let's create a new

800
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:08,220
circuit here you have another one take a

801
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:11,750
look use her bridge friends in the

802
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:11,750
Netherlands okay

803
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:36,339
okay this is what we've just done if we

804
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:38,410
wouldn't be able to access our webpage

805
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:43,900
for whatever reason we can do this also

806
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:50,649
through email great at tor project comm

807
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:53,490
including as title dead bridge I sound

808
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:57,870
that's another way of doing it

809
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:57,870
requesting this via email

810
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:15,960
and what happens if the provider blocks

811
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:20,190
the TR traffic and inspects that

812
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:23,110
packages what happens if it detects your

813
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:27,760
axis and doesn't block it well we can

814
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:31,150
circumvent this how by using the plugs

815
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:32,680
and transfer this transforms our to our

816
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:36,490
traffic into a completely different

817
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,770
traffic you can make the provider

818
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:43,500
believe that are your traffic is

819
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:46,240
streaming so we would be able to

820
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:49,540
overcome this restriction when

821
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:54,160
requesting the bridge we would ask him

822
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:56,770
to use these plugs and as before this

823
01:05:54,160 --> 01:06:05,529
has pasted and we are able to overcome

824
01:05:56,770 --> 01:06:08,920
this restriction and another other pros

825
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:10,600
we have may have is that we can want to

826
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,780
use to our browser by the service

827
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:16,450
provider the text that were able I

828
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:21,130
wanted to connect through one exit node

829
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:23,710
of T or what can we do us the tour

830
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:26,050
circuit and then we can set one of the

831
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:28,150
proxies we've seen earlier this is not

832
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:31,330
in one of the lists of blocking this

833
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:33,610
river and therefore we can do this the

834
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:36,069
problem is that it will be slower there

835
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:38,530
are three jumps three steps and a proxy

836
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:41,350
but we will be able to gain access and

837
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:44,940
here is another list of proxies aside

838
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:44,940
from the one I showed you earlier

839
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:59,080
and that's the end of this basic of

840
01:06:54,630 --> 01:07:00,910
course until our browser I'll be more

841
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,500
than happy to answer your queries

842
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:04,980
through questions thanks very much for

843
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,980
your attention

844
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:13,050
any questions comments

845
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:25,890
microphone please I'm afraid I don't

846
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:25,890
know

847
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:48,640
for onion share is there a limit as to

848
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:52,270
the subjects out of the file let me say

849
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:54,640
as to the size of the files I'm afraid I

850
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:57,700
don't know I've always used this with

851
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:03,040
pretty small files but I have no idea as

852
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:05,140
to this size limit of how heavy a file

853
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:08,640
that we want to send through onion and

854
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,640
share it could be I'm sorry

855
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:27,339
this is safe to introduce credentials

856
01:08:24,219 --> 01:08:30,700
and an email within that you are network

857
01:08:27,339 --> 01:08:32,488
I wouldn't recommend that because of the

858
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,358
exit nodes

859
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:36,669
problematics if there's someone

860
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:40,000
listening and that exit node and you're

861
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:43,180
not encrypting the communication beyond

862
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,100
that note if the credentials are in

863
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:55,529
plain text they may be stolen or

864
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:55,529
collected thanks very much everybody

865
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,990
you
