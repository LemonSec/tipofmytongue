getting ready and the others please bear

28
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:02,380
this in mind what is hackathon well of

29
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,050
course you know this perfectly well

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,330
otherwise you wouldn't be here the idea

31
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:11,880
is that you have fun during the upcoming

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:15,400
three days competing developing and

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,890
creating tools and tinkering with tools

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,930
that interest you in the world of cyber

35
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,660
security do you have fun that's number

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,190
one objective otherwise it makes no

37
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,560
sense

38
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,670
to come here with this wonderful sunny

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,830
weather to the coast and December the

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,869
goal is that you work as a team that you

41
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,820
learn from each other not only from

42
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:39,900
other members of your team but from

43
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,970
other teams and to work and something

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,620
that motivates you to create new tools

45
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:49,830
new solutions and the idea is that you

46
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,410
introduce something new to the rest of

47
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:56,070
the group and let me mention something

48
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,470
that is important both the Monica and I

49
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,560
and the other members of the jury and by

50
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,600
the way my name is Raul most see list

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,550
for you to know Monica Seles is my

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,670
colleague and I'll introduce you to the

53
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:12,120
other members of the jury soon let me

54
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:17,790
insist an open up code projects in

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:21,060
theory the National Institute has well

56
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:25,230
promoted these projects those of you

57
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,050
know very well that open source projects

58
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:32,488
are very common you're probably familiar

59
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:35,670
with an eMac Metasploit one mark these

60
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,239
aren't free the let's collaborate there

61
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:40,559
are thousands of way of creating

62
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,250
documentation sending a pull request

63
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,640
there many ways of collaborating so the

64
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,830
idea is that we work on and we

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,529
contribute to this this year we've

66
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:56,280
wanted to introduce some changes and the

67
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,380
competition and the ideas that you get

68
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,900
to know each other that you know what

69
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,730
other teams are competing against you so

70
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,350
here you have the list of teams with

71
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,190
their tools to worry because we will

72
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,579
hang this in panels in the hackathon

73
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,120
area we have 29 teams and there are six

74
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,739
seven members and the jury and

75
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,048
organization what are the requirements

76
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:22,500
for this hackathon well of course your

77
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:24,510
heart word and software laptop internet

78
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,210

79
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,740

to arrange food for the heck I thought

87
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:58,430
there will be a catering service so that

88
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:01,699
you can focus your attention fully the

89
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,009
hackathon today it's covered not

90
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:06,050
tomorrow because tomorrow will be quite

91
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:07,940
chaotic we will have the CTF the

92
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,699
environment will be more chaotic so make

93
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,860
sure you have food available for

94
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:15,680
tomorrow today let me insist that it's

95
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,120
covered please interrupt me Monica if I

96
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,560
forget something

97
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,580
each team where will we work as a

98
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,930
platform in geek hub so after the

99
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,948
presentations you will have to give us

100
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:33,560
the repository of their project and key

101
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:38,780
hoc so that we can monitor it you need

102
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:41,599
to give this to us at 12:30 at noon let

103
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,698
me make sure I'm accurate here from

104
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:46,759
12:00 to 12:30 we will have the

105
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:50,300
institutional opening session we will

106
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,330
have that time free so that you can

107
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,800
attend the opening session and on 12:30

108
00:05:53,330 --> 00:06:00,979
we will address those final questions

109
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,400
that you may have and what do you need

110
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:06,020
well the milestones and that we're going

111
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,060
to explain now and of course you will

112
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:12,560
need at least a member of the team

113
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,780
present and some teams have some members

114
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,110
participating today in cyber Olympics

115
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,698
others in CTF and the idea is that at

116
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:24,020
least one member of the team is here to

117
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:25,550
answer the questions of those germs as

118
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,568
far as cyber Olympics I because there's

119
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:32,360
one person aside yes timetable today

120
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:35,790
from 10 to 12 in this room

121
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,220
milestone two will be tomorrow from 12

122
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,980
to 2 and the hackathon area today will

123
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,170
be here from 10 to 12 from the rest of

124
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,570
the day we will be working have a

125
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,870
hackathon area you have your tables

126
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:51,630
assigned and then we will return here on

127
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,600
Sunday from 10 to 12 for final

128
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:57,480
presentation so it's quite simple

129
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,210
tomorrow remember that the key time is

130
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,500
from 12 to 2 the idea is that today most

131
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,510
during most of the day and tomorrow

132
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,970
morning you have time to prepare the

133
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,630
intermediate situation don't worry about

134
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:11,670
taking pictures because in the caucus on

135
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,340
area we have the monitor and we will

136
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:16,260
constantly have a presentation bit

137
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,700
shorter than these moment but with the

138
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:22,950
main info in a loop so that you can have

139
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,039
access to this info and will be around

140
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:29,190
so don't hesitate to ask us whatever you

141
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:34,770
wish and well there you have the

142
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:36,510
timetable from 10 to 8 the venue is open

143
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,909
and you can work here these are the

144
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:42,590
official timetables and we know that

145
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:47,070
you'll be at the hotel working because

146
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,570
hackers never sleep that's people that's

147
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,940
something people don't understand but

148
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,909
you know very well you will finish at

149
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,060
noon on Sunday and the awards ceremony

150
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:00,090
would be will be at 2 p.m. that's when

151
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,980
the closing ceremony will be when we

152
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:06,359
will give the awards for all the

153
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:10,730
competitions so bear that in mind in

154
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:17,700
terms of the timetable and as I've said

155
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:22,220
he hub and in the panel you will have

156
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,659
April on time tables and also the

157
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,970
results panel so that you know how the

158
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,900
competition involves it's probable or

159
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,919
likely that for the that everything is

160
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,348
anonymous

161
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,539
for a series of new elements that we've

162
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,819
introduced you will see this score and

163
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,549
you will know who you are and in what

164
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:45,849
position you are but you wouldn't know

165
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:50,019
who is before or behind you you'll see

166
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:54,189
team a team B to C so that you can't

167
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:56,049
deliberately attack each other because

168
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:57,669
Eve introduced some collaboration points

169
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:00,730
he wanted to avoid that so we were going

170
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:02,619
to give a more anonymity we want a more

171
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,809
collaboration less competition but of

172
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:08,290
course this is a competition now let me

173
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:11,139
add something we're already going to

174
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,868
randomize the scores you'll see the

175
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:16,779
order of teams but you won't know the

176
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:19,749
distance between the scores or the

177
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:22,119
different teams we want to make it as

178
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:24,999
exciting as possible as how people

179
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:26,980
believe now we're 30 points behind I'm

180
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:30,040
never going to win but you need to

181
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,619
consider the first milestone some have a

182
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,379
smaller weight some of you were in the

183
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:38,230
mobile and the last of always move on

184
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:39,699
the first milestone one the hackathon so

185
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,480
you understand how this competition

186
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:46,589
works how much time you will have

187
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,639
available now eight minutes for

188
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:51,610
presentation and two minutes for

189
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,249
questions the idea is that the rest of

190
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,869
the teams can ask positively or

191
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:57,970
negatively to the rest of the team

192
00:09:55,869 --> 00:10:01,869
either and make improvements adjustment

193
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,939
suggestions or raise critiques maybe say

194
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:06,759
oh that which you say you're going to do

195
00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:08,769
doesn't make much sense and this is the

196
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,129
reality of our community you have your

197
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:14,439
open source project some people say no

198
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:16,629
that's already being done this is crap

199
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:18,639
and other people that collaborate with

200
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:20,079
you and say why haven't you integrated

201
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,119
this with this other why haven't you

202
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,878
improve this or worked it on this or

203
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:26,769
that so ideas to combine both elements

204
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,720
positive and negative and we have the

205
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,579
mouth so it's quite this simple that we

206
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:36,579
have one today one tomorrow enough

207
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:39,429
one on Sunday and the jury's value will

208
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:41,079
be 94% why is this the case well because

209
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:44,350
he wanted you to give your opinion as

210
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,899
well and it's true that the percentage

211
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,819
that you're going to contribute with is

212
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:54,480
a small we also admit your criticism

213
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:58,209
during the first hackathon there was

214
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,519
manipulation of the teams this one is

215
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:03,699
competing against me so I'm going to

216
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:07,540
vote in favor of the worst team so that

217
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:10,929
the my number one rival doesn't out

218
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,599
match me or outperforming this is the

219
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:16,299
fourth a hackathon and we've learned

220
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,549
from our mistakes and that's why we've

221
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:20,980
wanted to provide greater anonymity

222
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:24,339
because some people are not playing

223
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,119
clean and you will have eight minutes

224
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:30,360
for presentations two minutes for

225
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:33,399
questions you will have 6% a

226
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,739
contribution to this court and the

227
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:42,929
maximum score will be 115 100 plus 15

228
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:45,339
which is an extra bonus as a result of a

229
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:48,189
collaboration at the end you will have

230
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:50,829
to fill in a questionnaire for your

231
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:54,579
feedback because you will take on board

232
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:57,209
your commons in order to design our next

233
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,209
hackathon

234
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,569
and let me mention something else we've

235
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,640
wanted to introduce changes this year's

236
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,200
because you want a greater hackathon

237
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,000
committee the past you've seen that

238
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,130
people work individually in their team

239
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,260
and then some questionnaires you have

240
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,660
said that you would have liked to know

241
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,390
what other teams were working on to be

242
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,520
able to collaborate and contribute so

243
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,230
presentations are public for this very

244
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,470
purpose so that you know what others are

245
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:28,500
working on and the bonus is intended to

246
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,450
encourage you to motivate you and to

247
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,090
understand that there so was our reward

248
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,460
if there's also a reward if you help

249
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:38,280
others and that's the spirit of this

250
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:41,250
year's edition the open code community

251
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,380
needs to promote collaboration among

252
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,590
everybody not only being consumers but

253
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:51,140
also contributing good we're going to

254
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:51,140
analyze ten and assess my criteria

255
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,870
security issues of the tool you're

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,400
working on functionality issues a

257
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:05,400
clarity of open source code usability

258
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,770
most obvious elements in the final mile

259
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,160
so we reveal all the criteria and then

260
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,220
the tube intermediate um milestones we

261
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,520
review four and six

262
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:19,890
okay so unduly explain here on this

263
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:24,590
slide of course depending on the state

264
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:27,330
the tool is at that moment in time and

265
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,430
it's very important that there's someone

266
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:32,670
in the team to answer your questions and

267
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:36,000
it's very important visa vie the muscles

268
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:38,370
that you upload an operating and version

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,500
of the tool so if something is already

270
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,850
up and running that's what you need to

271
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:48,060
upload during the maltose milestone 150

272
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,280
percent weight in score at 4:00 p.m.

273
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,319
today we will have in the panel some

274
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,740
results already what do you have to do

275
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,110
now we want to sell or picture to each a

276
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,230
picture tool I know that some are you

277
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:08,960
aren't that good at speaking in public

278
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:11,690
we technical people are often bit shy

279
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,190
but the truth is that you need to pitch

280
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,040
your tool and I'm talking about talking

281
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,980
about commercially pitching your tune

282
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,520
the idea is that the community bought it

283
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,010
that it finds it useful that you attract

284
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,500
other's attention and so that they want

285
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,200
to collaborate with you so there needs

286
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,170
to be a usability what are we going to

287
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,770
analyze functionality technical

288
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:39,170
complexity how innovative it is how it

289
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:43,880
contributes to the security community

290
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:46,579
and we will open up a Q&A for others to

291
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,590
take the floor and other teams that will

292
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:53,390
have questions for you of course you're

293
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:58,700
free to answer or not and 5% of the

294
00:14:53,390 --> 00:15:01,670
bonus is allocated to this criteria the

295
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,400
second milestone assesses the remaining

296
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,099
criteria this six remaining criteria to

297
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:13,040
be more exact and the last milestone

298
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:15,980
assesses the entire set of criteria so

299
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,589
on Sunday from 10 to 12 we will present

300
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,410
this and this scores will be given and

301
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:24,110
now let me talk about that bonus that is

302
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,839
given to those teams that collaborate

303
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,680
with others well it's being covered

304
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:34,000
already the idea is that the competition

305
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:38,150
is not just about competing against

306
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,520
other teams the ideas to contribute to

307
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:43,400
creating a community the hackathon as we

308
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,760
said is only the beginning we want to of

309
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:51,140
course reward the quality of tools and

310
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:54,439
also reward those teams that help other

311
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:58,220
teams the idea is to improve the overall

312
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,220
quality of hackathon projects and to

313
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,750
give continuity to those projects and we

314
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,770
also want to enhance or step up

315
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,870
collaboration among you because you

316
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,490
spend long hours here and sometimes he

317
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,680
go back home without knowing who was

318
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,410
sitting beside you the idea where the

319
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,170
catering service today

320
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:22,380
and so so that you get the chance to

321
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:25,120
meet each other to learn about your

322
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,860
proposals your projects and we believe

323
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,880
that this can be a good experience for

324
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:35,410
all as I was saying 15% of this course

325
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:40,030
will be will be contributed in the form

326
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:43,180
of bonus and the questions and the tips

327
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:46,329
and the advice given will be rewarded

328
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,069
with a 5% during stage 2 collaboration

329
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,560
with other projects during competition

330
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:54,760
the idea is that at any time you can

331
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,729
open an issue in Jihad these are the

332
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,460
other projects and we're going to score

333
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:05,699
this not based on the quality of issues

334
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:10,930
but the quality they're off and this can

335
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:15,579
help with the other team ah enhancer

336
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:19,600
it's - it's not a matter of let's say

337
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:22,859
chasing the team that you believe is in

338
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:27,849
number one no that's not the idea and

339
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:30,669
our idea for this edition is as I was

340
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:37,899
saying - fostering collaboration and we

341
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:40,120
want the teams to openly convey their

342
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:42,190
doubts and queries to the jury

343
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,949
anonymously and then we will make a

344
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,650
public presentation of those doubts if

345
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:52,240
teams have a dad work query they will

346
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:55,420
speak with us and then we will presented

347
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,400
these queries publicly that's the

348
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,710
approach that we wanted to add of this

349
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,680
year as

350
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,770
see how it goes and of course you don't

351
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,270
have to do it but if you do so you will

352
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:13,139
probably be supported and your endeavor

353
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,770
any other comments or questions at this

354
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,350
point

355
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:20,940
otherwise I'll continue well you know

356
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:22,709
what the awards are and it's true that

357
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,960
this year we wanted to introduce a

358
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,890
special award for students those that

359
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,060
are beginning to work and the security

360
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:36,150
community and we will soon address

361
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:42,110
questions but none let me before so give

362
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:47,970
you the order and this has been a

363
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:51,600
traditional process and there's a team

364
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:54,750
that likes number one and these are the

365
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,530
members of on thick these are the

366
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:01,050
winners of hackathon 2011 in 2016 it's

367
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:04,139
really a coincidence you probably feel

368
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:06,629
much pressure and the challenge for the

369
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,930
remaining teams has to outmatch or to

370
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,700
outperform the number one team and they

371
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:15,210
will be the first to make their

372
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,140
presentation as well thank you very much

373
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,700
for coming back again thanks very much

374
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,680
this people come from out of a SATA

375
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,220
they're very much motivated out of a

376
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,750
there's not a close to us on time there

377
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,230
they've traveled quite a long distance

378
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:33,930
this is the order and those that were

379
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,730
lucky to take the form towards the end

380
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:39,690
like a malware scanner will have a

381
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,780
chance to see others percent first but

382
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:46,080
the idea is that in the final

383
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:48,780
presentations in the next milestones we

384
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,260
will give it four first to the last the

385
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:56,670
idea is that you all find yourselves and

386
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,440
the same situation and those teams that

387
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,900
know that they're going to take them for

388
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:05,150
right after the protecting team please

389
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:08,960
start getting ready so that the

390
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:11,330
so that it's all a fast process we want

391
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,490
to make sure that we streamline this

392
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,949
process as much as possible that said on

393
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:21,320
our side any questions any doubts if so

394
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:24,170
yes no apparently it's crystal clear

395
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:28,870
really no queries no doubts we're

396
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:31,760
amazing no well jokes aside you have the

397
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:35,570
document with all the info you have

398
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:39,620
questions feel free to interrupt us the

399
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:42,379
first group can stand out come to stage

400
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:45,139
let's forget about formalities here and

401
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,679
we're here in our community so get ready

402
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:53,660
to make your presentation we have

403
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:57,620
laptops with 1080 HDMI or VGA we're

404
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:00,050
going to start or a USB Drive if needed

405
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm going to remove my laptop and I'm

406
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:05,300
going to introduce the members of the

407
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,220
jury we have a dunny got a thing I could

408
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,700
on please stand up

409
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,740
chip you probably have met him he

410
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,200
doesn't collaborate with open-source

411
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:18,380
projects right Jose Selvi he's also new

412
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,020
right he began very recently working in

413
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:24,320
this field and he has high well known

414
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,379
tools we have a cattle and we thought

415
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,450
that it would be interested to

416
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,790
interesting to have someone from the

417
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:34,850
local community cell phone is the name

418
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,590
of the Santander local community we

419
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,928
wanted to have someone we were scented

420
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:42,439
so thanks very much Carol we have Ethan

421
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:44,780
tell you later he's doing right he he's

422
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,450
a newcomer my broker he doesn't really

423
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,750
like Twitter right and but apparently he

424
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:55,670
has a tool that work on Twitter and we

425
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:59,090
we have Oscar or mr. breakfast from MTV

426
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:02,330
the National Institute and he has joined

427
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:05,659
us and all the hackathons and he is

428
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:08,740
amazing and he'll probably be willing to

429
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:11,090
share in thievish approach abuse and

430
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,120
Monica's also a member of the team I've

431
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,590
already seen her so we're going to give

432
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,649
the floor without further ado to the

433
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,970
first team of you

434
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,650
eat anything specific for your

435
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,880
presentation please let us know as you

436
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:24,850
have these 2 mics

437
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,700
I believe that there are a couple of

438
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:30,070
hand mics for questions we will move

439
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,140
around the mics as required so please

440
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,950
come on stage and get ready for your

441
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,950
presentation

442
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:22,639
was listening for it ready to go there

443
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:23,740
Eastern okay I'll start go for it good

444
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,530
morning

445
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:32,419
well we're the antic team made up of

446
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:36,320
Ricardo Alex Herman and myself my name

447
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:37,480
is Alfonso we work for a company in

448
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,520
avasthitah called

449
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:46,940
click soluciones we work with free

450
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:50,929
software and we specialize in e-commerce

451
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:53,510
we also participate in the Navajo naira

452
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:56,169
Congress organized in alpha theta in our

453
00:24:53,510 --> 00:25:01,549
city and we heard the defending

454
00:24:56,169 --> 00:25:03,679
champions we won in 2015 and 2016 and

455
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:05,440
we're here to try to win again and of

456
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,020
course we're here to try to have fun

457
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:13,370
together with all of you the two we want

458
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:17,179
to present this are FM radio frequency

459
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:20,270
mapper or RF map that is aimed at

460
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:24,350
detecting and monitoring networks and

461
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:28,010
wireless devices this is the equivalent

462
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:31,969
to Finn for Android or in Mac but

463
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:36,169
targeted towards and wireless networks

464
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:38,240
and devices as for the aspects we want

465
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:41,630
to focus on we want to provide support

466
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:45,409
for a Wi-Fi Bluetooth Internet of the

467
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:49,070
things in 433 in five six eight

468
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:53,299
megahertz a GSM and radio frequency of

469
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:55,908
all sorts were types what are the key

470
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:58,539
features or capabilities that we want to

471
00:25:55,909 --> 00:26:02,780
give to this tune number one would be to

472
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:05,929
detect wireless networks and devices as

473
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,908
I said earlier the idea is to make an

474
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:11,679
inventory of the radio electrical

475
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:14,480
spectrum to be able to monitor all these

476
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,330
devices and networks and other

477
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,020
conditions we want to implement later

478
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:23,710
with time we want to be able to match

479
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,870
data with time graphs we want to try to

480
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,679
identify protocols and services that

481
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:31,809
offer these networks for devices

482
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:35,170
implement an alert system to be able to

483
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:38,440
detect new devices and this tool can be

484
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:41,920
used to optimize the use of the spectrum

485
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:47,890
and the idea that it helps in the

486
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:50,260
planning of wireless deployments as for

487
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:52,059
this scope is quite wide to be believed

488
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,600
that this tool can be used in

489
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:59,879
professional settings for pen testing

490
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:03,189
and security also industrial and

491
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,360
settings we wanted to prepare your case

492
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:08,710
study and also for network deployment

493
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,709
purposes it's a free tool and everybody

494
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:14,970
can use it and the tool will be free

495
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:19,690
software we believe that it could be

496
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:25,030
scalable and that we can increase its

497
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:26,710
functionality further and as I will and

498
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,440
now the idea is that we can add

499
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:34,990
additional hardware of course there are

500
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:36,850
no tools available as of today like RF

501
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,550
map it's true that there are some

502
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,740
applications out there that cover some

503
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:44,678
of the aspects that we cover we have

504
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,830
scanners for Wi-Fi for Bluetooth and for

505
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:51,429
other technologies but there's no tool

506
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:56,409
no open-source tool that encompasses all

507
00:27:51,429 --> 00:28:00,550
these elements so our idea is to be able

508
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:03,250
to embrace all these wide variety of

509
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,530
technologies and devices and the idea is

510
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:08,500
to bring them together under the

511
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,899
umbrella of our tool during the past

512
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,809
years we've understood that there has

513
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:16,210
been a blossoming and the use of

514
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:20,820
wireless devices and traditional

515
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:23,020
security audits are sometimes miss

516
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:25,510
sometimes I'm missing some of these

517
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:28,650
devices because there is no tool out

518
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:32,800
there that helps security technicians

519
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:35,140
manage all networks and devices there is

520
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,340
a wide variety of software out there

521
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:44,020
that adds to the complexity we also want

522
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:46,449
to implement reporting tool as well as

523
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,550
for the technology we're going to use we

524
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:51,430
have a combination of software and

525
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:56,010
hardware regarding software we want to

526
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:59,080
do a core that will be in charge of

527
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:02,320
processing the tool and then we want to

528
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,480
do separately web interface in order to

529
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,860
administer this as for hard work

530
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:12,280
we we have a great amount of werlla some

531
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:14,740
hard work but it's a very expensive very

532
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,680
costly and we want this tool to be a low

533
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:22,060
cost tool so we're going to use the

534
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,830
Wi-Fi and bluetooth of laptops we're

535
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,470
going to use and for radiofrequency

536
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:28,659
purposes we're going to use sort of us

537
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:33,610
that you were seeing on screen basically

538
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:34,840
small sticks though that are used to

539
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:37,750
watch TV

540
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,300
TDT / thanks to a hack that was

541
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:45,190
published so many years ago these can be

542
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:49,750
used and STR SDR software-defined radio

543
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:52,480
radio SCR that will help us work for

544
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:56,590
this hackathon and the frequencies

545
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,840
between 22 and 2200 megahertz we've

546
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:03,550
chosen this device because it's very

547
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:06,820
cheap you can find it on eBay at 6 euros

548
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:09,220
although there are some more expensive

549
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:12,550
and pricy devices the idea is that

550
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,490
anyone can easily access this tool as

551
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:18,370
for development well we start from

552
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,550
scratch we haven't brought anything

553
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:23,310
already done and

554
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:26,040
technologies that I mentioned earlier we

555
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:31,080
want to implement Wi-Fi Bluetooth IOT

556
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:32,940
GSM and I prepared some questions and

557
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,990
this year we want to promote

558
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:39,810
collaboration and from minute one we

559
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:42,060
want to help you and if such from these

560
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:44,480
four technologies that we've considered

561
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:48,050
you believe that other devices and other

562
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,870
technologies could be a fan turist

563
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:54,540
since we've come with virtually nothing

564
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:58,649
I'd be interesting to add further things

565
00:30:54,540 --> 00:31:01,800
as for the radio frequency spectrum if

566
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,930
you believe that there's a specific part

567
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,639
of the range that is more interesting

568
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:08,370
because it's impossible to cover at all

569
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,290
please feel free to give us your advice

570
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,870
or suggestions and regarding the

571
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:15,600
interface if you have any proposals as

572
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:20,250
to what do you believe is essential and

573
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:23,820
needs to be included any tips regarding

574
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:27,030
the visual settings please feel free to

575
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,340
let us know I'm about to wrap up so bear

576
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:31,980
with me a minute regarding scalability

577
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,010
and community as we do with all our

578
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:38,190
projects we always believe that design

579
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:42,690
should be collaborative in nature in

580
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:45,990
addition to the development we want to

581
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:49,410
have an easy tool so you can add new

582
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:53,280
devices you can use it with new

583
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:55,590
technologies that can detect new

584
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:59,250
vulnerabilities and of course multi

585
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:01,280
language and translation included and to

586
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:04,980
conclude I like to thank you all for

587
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:08,129
being here I would like to thank the

588
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:10,730
organizers for having supported with

589
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:15,090
transport that has been a bit difficult

590
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:17,670
to wish you the best of Luck's I hope we

591
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:21,590
will enjoy the next few days and if you

592
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,590
have any questions we are available

593
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:25,229
[Applause]

594
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,689
do you have any questions and please use

595
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:35,000
the microphone if you ask questions then

596
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:38,150
we members of the uri we will ask you

597
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:46,310
questions later on do we have any

598
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:48,670
question or comment although good

599
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:51,350
morning

600
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:54,740
in the section and related to

601
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:58,820
radiofrequency what are the devices you

602
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:04,540
juicing in relation to radiofrequency

603
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:10,840
what are the devices you use from 430

604
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:10,840
mega earth you need a specific license

605
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:30,629
wait we haven't decided yet but we have

606
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:33,809
two bags full of we devices PM ours we

607
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:36,599
have wireless headsets and many

608
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:39,869
different devices we don't even know

609
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:43,468
what frequency they work in the idea is

610
00:33:39,869 --> 00:33:48,168
to work now on that and analyze its

611
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:51,989
suitability but we have a wide range and

612
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:56,459
for 33 megahertz that is a normal

613
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:59,489
frequency for IOT that is an open

614
00:33:56,459 --> 00:34:04,799
frequency I believe they will be

615
00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:07,139
compatible thank you sort questions and

616
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:10,889
answers otherwise we will not have

617
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:11,489
enough time more questions the second

618
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:14,730
team

619
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:16,469
Trillian please come to the panel if

620
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:19,279
there are no further questions I will

621
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:24,658
make one why haven't you use keys myrrh

622
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:27,929
is true that you never find the two that

623
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,749
is useful for your purpose but more

624
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:33,450
suited one is kismet that allows you to

625
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:37,279
use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and other

626
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,279
wireless technologies as plug-in

627
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:46,078
Chrisman I as much as I know is suitable

628
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:50,399
for supported technologies but when we

629
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:54,839
wanted to go away and making a spectrum

630
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,660
analysis or to work with GSM here I see

631
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:01,558
that kismet and other tools that are

632
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:05,390
focused for scanning were not so

633
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:08,309
powerful some of those tools are

634
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:12,180
specific they will support Bluetooth and

635
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:15,890
Wi-Fi this part is easy but when you get

636
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:20,299
out of this range and you want to use

637
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:24,029
different devices at different or weird

638
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:27,329
frequencies then is not appropriate

639
00:35:24,029 --> 00:35:30,210
basically it has the capacity for

640
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:34,049
plugins to add new things

641
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:37,410
I'm just being the devil's advocate here

642
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:40,829
and this is something very common in our

643
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:51,328
community so thank you now the team

644
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:56,430
through Jana thank you and please ask

645
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:57,930
questions we thank the first person to

646
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:01,589
ask it was and everything seems to be

647
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:04,710
very clear today what they didn't say is

648
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:08,130
that they thank you for being here and

649
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:10,369
also of course competition is happened

650
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,369
so

651
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:43,030
but all right what's up hello can you

652
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:43,029
hear me

653
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:07,200
when all has a lot oh good morning to

654
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:09,599
everyone our name is to transport

655
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,899
oriented to hive we like to thank

656
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,780
Hawkins organizers we decided to bring

657
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:19,049
the drones last minute we asked them if

658
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:22,010
they could get us some they gave a quick

659
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:25,950
response we couldn't bring drones here

660
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:29,760
because of potential accidents we

661
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,868
understand it who we are first we have

662
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,180
to introduce myself

663
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:35,910
I am Daniel Garcia my colleague is

664
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:40,379
medium tend arrow founders of the

665
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:42,808
hacking group in the competence

666
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,329
University in Madrid and we organized

667
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:48,690
the cybersecurity event macro party

668
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:51,869
Madrid and we are members of an NGO

669
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:55,049
devoted to open source the

670
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:57,030
functionalities of the project I will

671
00:37:55,049 --> 00:38:00,390
introduce the project in a graphic way

672
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:04,890
we want to set a communication in a

673
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:08,220
specific area this is Spain the area of

674
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:11,009
our choice is Cantabria in this area we

675
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:15,959
are going to deploy or I'll draw our

676
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:19,460
drones in this inside Elena would like

677
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,770
to contact Jose through the cloud

678
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:25,319
created by our drones how is this going

679
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:28,559
to work in these are our drones that

680
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:31,049
will be located in different sites that

681
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:36,779
will be fixed for a specific

682
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:39,960
drone then Elena is here Elena and Jose

683
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:42,180
Elena wants to send a message to Jose so

684
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:47,160
Elena will connect to a drone the drone

685
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:51,270
will receive Elena's very fine her

686
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:54,080
identity through user authentication

687
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:57,330
the drum gets the message and then

688
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:59,790
connects to another drone and the second

689
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:04,710
drone say okay you belong to my system

690
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:07,440
and I accept the message and the same

691
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:10,290
process goes on with the next drone

692
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,490
therefore drone detects that Jose is a

693
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:17,700
user and therefore Jose can open the

694
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:19,200
message the scope of application of the

695
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,540
project and benefits for the community

696
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,399
is a new cloud created from the scratch

697
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:29,550
for communications some of the uses

698
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,850
might be military in conflictive areas

699
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:36,330
or the army is in the desert without

700
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:40,440
connection we launch our drones and they

701
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:44,610
will be able to connect to another site

702
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:48,750
in the same area or catastrophes we had

703
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:51,150
files in galleys we launched our drones

704
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:53,780
and the fire brigade can communicate

705
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:59,119
among themselves without interference

706
00:39:53,780 --> 00:40:02,640
security what we will do to avoid

707
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,800
security leaks is detection there will

708
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,839
be authentic Asian for everyone that

709
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:15,930
wants to connect to our cloud to avoid

710
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:19,790
drones impersonation so that could be a

711
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:24,149
problem to the rest of the drones and

712
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:26,580
using coded or cipher message and to end

713
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,830
and if somebody captures it in the

714
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:32,520
middle they will not be able to read it

715
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:35,670
because it is encrypted this is a new

716
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:41,400
concept I haven't seen any project that

717
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:43,920
has a new communications code based in

718
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,260
drones at least myself or and my

719
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,990
colleague do not know it there are

720
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,270
similar projects Google agree on a large

721
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:56,060
company but Google uses drones that

722
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:59,340
provide Internet access we want to

723
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:06,840
facilitate the communications network

724
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:12,720
only for a specific team our approach

725
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:15,630
for the competition this is our starting

726
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,480
point we have the concepts the planning

727
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:22,830
the drafts but we start from scratch

728
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:26,820
this is the idea with your help you will

729
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:30,060
help us to carry on there will be a

730
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:32,640
connection between users and nodes this

731
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,070
is a fixed authentication to avoid

732
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,490
aliens to the system then we will

733
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:42,570
generate tables exchange the drones get

734
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:44,609
to know the neighbour in drones to

735
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:48,240
select the one that has to send the

736
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:52,530
message and then secure information we

737
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,649
were communication end to end in a coded

738
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:57,750
way encrypted way so nobody can read it

739
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:01,890
we want to highlight that this is a new

740
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:03,650
communications system that is needed we

741
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,690
need a reliable and stable

742
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:09,840
communications way you just have to

743
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,240
launch the drones my colleague and

744
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,970
myself we want to bring about the future

745
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:23,819
into today and we will do it in cyber

746
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:33,569
camp thank you do you have any questions

747
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:37,800
all right please use the microphone ok

748
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:42,210
hello I have two questions the first how

749
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:45,510
are you going to set the shortest path

750
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,280
and the connection among nodes that is

751
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:52,470
the fastest one how are you going to

752
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:57,510
avoid possible loops among the nodes or

753
00:42:52,470 --> 00:43:00,029
drones themselves ok the idea is that

754
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:02,700
this drone I don't know if this but the

755
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,290
pointer is working can you see that ok

756
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,330
I'll do it with my finger that this

757
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:09,200
drone is going to be in this area you

758
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:12,828
will have in the algorithm

759
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,990
the drones three until are close and if

760
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:16,819
they takes that the closest one is drone

761
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:19,220
number three that will be the one that

762
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:21,680
gets the information in all the chart

763
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:24,950
the tables and algorithm we will have

764
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,470
point a and point B Elena sends the

765
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:31,129
message and the drone says it will have

766
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:34,430
to reach drone three in order to get to

767
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,859
Jose drone three will decide whether the

768
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:41,180
most suited drone is number four or not

769
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:45,170
yes but in order to avoid loops there it

770
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:48,740
will be in the algorithm so the shortest

771
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:50,839
path way will be indicated in case it's

772
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,759
not possible it will go from one into

773
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:55,759
another but it will be in different

774
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,920
layers first second and third once it

775
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:08,589
goes to the second level it cannot go

776
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:14,869
back to the first hello what happens if

777
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:20,180
they drum disappears or is just it just

778
00:44:14,869 --> 00:44:24,290
Falls then I can speak about Shepherd

779
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:26,720
that just with a stone could destroy a

780
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:28,430
military plane or helicopter but if the

781
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,140
three dies let us imagine that it

782
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:34,160
disappears from this area the rest of

783
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:35,930
the drones will deal with the area so

784
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,910
there will be full coverage without

785
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:43,490
voids and in this case we are speaking

786
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:46,819
about five drones but Elena can be here

787
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:52,180
and Elena decide who she wants to

788
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:52,180
connect to more questions

789
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,460
please introduce yourselves with the

790
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:02,390
name of your team

791
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:03,200
we are Monza hot demon and I have two

792
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,230
questions

793
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:11,930
wouldn't it be more efficient to check

794
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:16,880
whether the river belongs to the system

795
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:18,919
before making the routine Elena knows

796
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,730
that she will send a message to jose

797
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,140
perez de la it has drawn the one that

798
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:26,030
verifies that the recipient of the

799
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:29,480
message belongs to the system you can

800
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:33,050
save all this if you can use drum number

801
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,480
four without the check-in but we wanted

802
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:40,030
to do it to make it more reliable yes

803
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:46,570
you should check it but if there isn't a

804
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:51,320
user or you avoid all the processing I

805
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:53,630
don't quite grasp what you mean here you

806
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,820
have received the message in three

807
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:58,190
different drones and you have processed

808
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:02,330
the message in three drones which has

809
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:04,910
meant expenditure in processing heat but

810
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:10,580
there is power if only two drones

811
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:13,040
process the message a with a user

812
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:17,840
identification the idea was to make it

813
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,279
free and open then in cyber camp ask us

814
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,800
to make it more secure and we

815
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,070
implemented security features maybe

816
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:28,070
number one and number three can wait for

817
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:31,400
number four to check that versus an

818
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:34,700
authenticated user and then he could get

819
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,580
the message but it would take longer if

820
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:41,890
it's reliable the idea of the project is

821
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:46,819
to have different layers level till and

822
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:51,629
the fastest the better yes but then the

823
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:54,749
check-in is through keys right

824
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:57,089
why don't you create a distributed

825
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:59,988
database so that each drum can check

826
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:03,058
without needing to be close to the user

827
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:07,410
whether these uses belongs to the system

828
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:10,700
or not each drone will have its own mini

829
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:14,899
database Elena will connect to the drone

830
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:19,259
sending a house or a token and this has

831
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:22,200
identifies just one person when looking

832
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:25,140
in if the drone acknowledges that is

833
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,359
just one person you can get the message

834
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,098
drone one will connect to the three will

835
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,150
send the house or the token to number

836
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:35,579
three drone number three will say these

837
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:38,369
belongs to one of our drones so I let

838
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:41,279
you pass the message through where is

839
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:44,160
the advantage compared to post satellite

840
00:47:41,279 --> 00:47:47,609
communication this is going to be just

841
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,979
above your head yes you can have

842
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:52,019
satellite communication and it's more

843
00:47:49,979 --> 00:47:54,210
profitable but if it's not possible at

844
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:56,578
least you have the possibility to launch

845
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:59,130
the drones and it will be ready in 10

846
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:00,630
second wouldn't it be better to use land

847
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:04,049
drones that are less visible

848
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:07,559
unattackable in this case we used drones

849
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:09,329
to use a visible example but we're going

850
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:11,849
to the verb here can be used for land

851
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:16,229
ones or any other drones are just

852
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:18,059
visible I love them so to be able to use

853
00:48:16,229 --> 00:48:20,729
it on and see how they exchange messages

854
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:22,349
is something we love but the idea is

855
00:48:20,729 --> 00:48:24,930
that the code that we will develop here

856
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:28,140
can be used in any different platform

857
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:32,729
even in a raspberry that is a fixed

858
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:36,058
device cyber water and here can now go

859
00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:38,129
to the panel and we will stop here we

860
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:39,779
cannot ask for questions to the same

861
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:43,069
team because the rest of the teams will

862
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:43,069
not have a chance to talk

863
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:52,720
we may have a final Q&A while um-- while

864
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:56,759
the panel lists arrive now you can think

865
00:48:52,720 --> 00:49:00,459
about future questions okay here I am

866
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:04,690
Carlos from cyber butcher nice to meet

867
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:06,400
you I'm not an expert in drones I don't

868
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:09,880
know if you control so much no we're not

869
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,430
the real experts you work on the code

870
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,980
we've been working with drones we have

871
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:17,069
piloted them from the computer but I

872
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:19,750
couldn't speak about being an expert

873
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:22,390
what about the technical specifications

874
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:27,069
of the drones what is the height limit

875
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:28,799
or other scope of each drone in order to

876
00:49:27,069 --> 00:49:31,359
reach a second one it will be

877
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,839
implemented through Wi-Fi but also

878
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:38,290
bluetooth is possible the idea is not so

879
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:41,859
much the drone but the code drones will

880
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:45,849
be connected by intensity the closer the

881
00:49:41,859 --> 00:49:50,950
better if their drones have a range of

882
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:53,290
200 meters of communication they will

883
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:56,529
have to be connected each drone 200

884
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:59,140
meters for example the idea is to

885
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:01,770
develop a system to communicate anything

886
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:05,799
as our colleague said it could be in

887
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:09,400
mobile mini cars or drones you detect

888
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:13,890
design and the closest one detects the

889
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,890
messages as set in a cloud system

890
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:31,899
are you going to use the handheld

891
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:36,730
microphone or the fixed one this is very

892
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:44,860
difficult to pronounce but makes room

893
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:47,640
please get ready so we set the

894
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,640
presentation

895
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:04,390
and then return zero so that they get

896
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,390
ready

897
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,950
okay the floor is yours

898
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:15,650
good morning oh we are a cyber watchers

899
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:19,640
we come from a small village in the

900
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:24,170
Pyrenees feral thought by the way he's

901
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:27,020
having Danny and Michaela Holly we come

902
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:28,670
from a Montessori School we are the

903
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:32,300
students please don't be too hard on us

904
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:33,500
and we're going to introduce our project

905
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,350
first

906
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:40,840
how many internet sites do we have our

907
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:43,759
know probably as I speak in new ones are

908
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:48,040
in Internet do you have all your

909
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:51,500
information in the net is your data

910
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:56,480
secure or they been shared by third

911
00:51:51,500 --> 00:52:04,010
parties who has ever googled you or your

912
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:09,920
friend or your girlfriend a few days ago

913
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:12,890
I met I found a portfolio a wallet and

914
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,920
the floral he just has two cards driving

915
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:18,470
lessons and a student's card I look for

916
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,560
the data and internet and I could access

917
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:24,109
public sources as Farah was a university

918
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:29,060
and thanks to one of the publication's

919
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:31,750
ability I could see what the person was

920
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,750
studying

921
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:41,260
and I could call some of his friends and

922
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:43,119
thanks to that the bird got back his

923
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:46,420
wallet thanks to public information in

924
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:49,470
Internet and I have 10 years went good

925
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:54,580
and one bad I will start by the bad one

926
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:57,399
much of your personal information is

927
00:52:54,580 --> 00:53:00,190
public Internet and can be used by third

928
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:03,520
parties the good one the good news is

929
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:05,650
that we're going to help you get to know

930
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:11,820
and use this information what we call

931
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:14,530
the digital fingerprint now digital

932
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:16,359
fingerprint is the trace we are live

933
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:20,560
when we surf the net

934
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:23,549
there are engines that compile this

935
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:30,250
information copy it and they can be

936
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:33,300
recouped or retrieved there are many

937
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:37,020
different websites with information

938
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:39,640
about how to erase your digital

939
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:44,339
footprint is very complex

940
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:49,089
the recent a key that once you press it

941
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:53,049
or your information might be raised

942
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:55,119
unless you are a very famous person and

943
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:58,839
I want to launch the following question

944
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:03,010
how can we access the public part of the

945
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:06,099
digital footprint this could be with us

946
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:11,609
in source and my colleague will speak

947
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:13,990
about them or synth means open source

948
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:16,779
intelligent or synthesis are all

949
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:20,618
information sources as digital bulletins

950
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:25,050
blogs social media where we can have

951
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:29,890
public data accessible by all Osun is

952
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:32,980
therefore a huge amount of volumes there

953
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:36,250
are companies that manager sent data in

954
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:39,130
order to carry out marketing analysis we

955
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:43,160
believe that information is power so

956
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:45,710
what can our to cyber butcher do

957
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,410
with cyber watcher the idea is to

958
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:51,290
determine the digital footprint under

959
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:57,049
presence in Internet in a user-friendly

960
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:59,270
and easy manner describing the person's

961
00:54:57,050 --> 00:55:06,230
exposure to Internet and the level of

962
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:09,380
risk so we can give information to the

963
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:11,930
users about their internet profile

964
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:14,210
whether it's being shared in other

965
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:17,660
places or whether there is sensitive

966
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:21,070
information in internet or if third

967
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:26,230
parties can commit cyber crimes with our

968
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:30,440
public data where the technology is used

969
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:35,750
we've used PHP programming language the

970
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:39,680
database MySQL and Ajax for the as the

971
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:44,950
interface user interface what is our

972
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:48,319
target audience all those companies or

973
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:50,950
users that would like to access the

974
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:53,570
public information with digital

975
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:56,000
footprint we want to raise the awareness

976
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:58,820
that is very important that all

977
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,300
information in the net can be sensitive

978
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:04,850
and damaging for the users as you all

979
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,130
know there are many people that really

980
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:09,950
publish their information in the net and

981
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:11,780
then they can no longer control it what

982
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:16,939
are we going to do this weekend as a

983
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:20,360
team our tool is in development process

984
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:23,270
our idea is to find unit and add new

985
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,980
functionalities thank you very much for

986
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:27,340
your attention

987
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:30,340
[Applause]

988
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,340
questions

989
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:41,750
hola hello I am Abdul and I'd like to

990
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:44,600
ask you about the functionalities they

991
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:48,890
do would like to end during the civil

992
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:52,850
camper weekend our tool starts from

993
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:54,799
collecting information in a database but

994
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:59,360
it's my colleague the one that will in

995
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:02,720
fact respond to your question basically

996
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:05,330
we collect in public information about

997
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,939
somebody in Internet once we have this

998
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:12,380
information indexed in a database we

999
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:14,780
apply algorithm to determine the level

1000
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:16,520
of studies and job of this person that

1001
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:18,830
is to say personal information and then

1002
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:23,120
we speak about the level of risk of

1003
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:30,549
somebody once this information is public

1004
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:30,549
in the net okay next question

1005
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:41,090
hello more than a question is to make a

1006
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:43,790
suggestion about new functionalities I

1007
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:46,310
don't know if you just go into detect

1008
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:50,420
sensitive information as a suggestion

1009
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:53,390
you might add one part to erase the

1010
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:57,520
information we wish all of this that is

1011
00:57:53,390 --> 00:58:03,350
the depth value to so we can erase it

1012
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:07,520
basically to erase data in Internet is

1013
00:58:03,350 --> 00:58:11,480
quite complex many are how much of this

1014
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:13,730
information is that is in database so to

1015
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,270
legally access this information is very

1016
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:19,670
difficult

1017
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:22,040
cyber watcher is just an informative for

1018
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:25,760
information to list use for users to

1019
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:29,830
know whether their information in

1020
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:35,470
Internet can be sensitive to them and

1021
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:35,470
this is the idea it's just information

1022
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:41,390
if you could erase this information it

1023
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:43,850
would be great maybe if you add some

1024
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:47,589
messages like you can erase this

1025
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:53,210
information with the following process

1026
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:56,180
if the system could automatically do it

1027
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:58,490
it would be great we have an idea but

1028
00:58:56,180 --> 00:59:01,730
we're just on an early development stage

1029
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:04,520
we might incorporate it later I'd like

1030
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:08,690
to add that we know that Internet is an

1031
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:11,240
open infinite place and each country has

1032
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:12,920
its own laws and legislations and in

1033
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,080
order to exist we should get to know

1034
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:18,410
about all regulatory frameworks of

1035
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:22,580
course we can add this information to

1036
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:27,319
say this is your where your data is

1037
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:34,670
hosted and you can implement your right

1038
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:36,800
to forget information is too public we

1039
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:41,500
would like people to be aware of this

1040
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:44,930
and we want to add a script or a

1041
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:48,800
most frequent questions about how can we

1042
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:52,490
erase this information but we do not

1043
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:55,130
finally erase anything ourselves we just

1044
00:59:52,490 --> 01:00:00,020
provide the information and we raise

1045
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:03,530
people's awareness about this from

1046
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:05,720
follow the way Robert another dude

1047
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:10,700
launch your application where you need

1048
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:13,600
name and last name well we need the

1049
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:17,290
person to give us some impersonal

1050
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:21,650
information and from then on to make

1051
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:25,730
search a data source and then carry out

1052
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:26,810
an analysis so that we can then present

1053
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,660
this information

1054
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:32,960
have you taken into account false

1055
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:35,359
positive there are many names there are

1056
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,960
people that have to share the same name

1057
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:43,310
yes we already have filtered for the

1058
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:48,350
data search next team please come to the

1059
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:51,529
panel see if you can erase the

1060
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:54,880
information please contact me because I

1061
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:58,810
will sell this tool this fantastic tool

1062
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,810
the retro or big or she

1063
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:47,500

prepare and return the next team to take

1067
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:19,280
the floor will be returns here because

1068
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:23,660
want to make sure that we pass on the

1069
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:37,490
baton fast from one team to another for

1070

copy and on our survey for the most

1080
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:22,880
let's move on to the next team while we

1081
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:26,230
get a technical issue sorted is there a

1082
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:29,150
team that doesn't need any special

1083
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:32,170
screen requirements is so the case

1084
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:32,170
please raise your hand

1085
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:33,820
ninguna B pension hacer un project okay

1086
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:37,600
how about a project that solves these

1087
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:41,860
technical issues just connecting and

1088
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:51,790
plugging your laptop and have it up on

1089
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:54,390
the screen it's working so please the

1090
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:54,390
floor is yours

1091

hola hola good morning everybody

1092
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:13,479
we are returned so yet more to use the

1093
01:05:12,019 --> 01:05:17,359
maestro

1094
01:05:13,479 --> 01:05:20,259
I'm Liz and myself but hollowed into are

1095
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:25,279
the members of return zero we are

1096
01:05:20,259 --> 01:05:28,939
students of the fourth year of computing

1097
01:05:25,279 --> 01:05:32,539
engineering and Madrid and we are

1098
01:05:28,939 --> 01:05:36,848
collaborating with the self net project

1099
01:05:32,539 --> 01:05:41,900
that is in the framework of horizon 2020

1100
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:45,789
that target security systems we work in

1101
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:51,439
the software engineering and a I

1102
01:05:45,789 --> 01:05:55,249
department of our university there with

1103
01:05:51,439 --> 01:06:01,009
me a second screen is frozen this

1104
01:05:55,249 --> 01:06:04,698
project is aimed at self managing future

1105
01:06:01,009 --> 01:06:06,949
5th generation Network we want to go a

1106
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:12,920
step further and we're going to present

1107
01:06:06,949 --> 01:06:20,539
the Droid Sentinel tool droid sentinel

1108
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:23,029
is aimed at attacking d OS attacks

1109
01:06:20,539 --> 01:06:25,339
didn't I love service attacks basically

1110
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:28,069
we're talking two attacks to a set of

1111
01:06:25,339 --> 01:06:31,939
computers for networks that leads to

1112
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:36,079
down times and crashing computers and

1113
01:06:31,939 --> 01:06:42,450
thus denying access to the legitimate

1114
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:45,089
users and this is due to an overload

1115
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:48,689
and computation systems why happy

1116
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:54,828
focused on denial of service attacks

1117
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:59,190
according to a report presented by the

1118
01:06:54,829 --> 01:07:03,109
cryptographic Center during the second

1119
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:07,260
quarter these attacks have increased by

1120
01:07:03,109 --> 01:07:10,170
49 percent as opposed to the figures

1121
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:13,920
from last year according to a survey 63

1122
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:16,319
percent of companies have suffered EOS

1123
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:21,020
attacks and 49 percent of them have

1124
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:23,609
incurred in losses and the tune of

1125
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:26,369
$100,000 per hour and when talking about

1126
01:07:23,609 --> 01:07:29,250
gos attacks it's very important to talk

1127
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:32,250
about botnets here we have the

1128
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:40,619
architecture of a botnet a centralized

1129
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:44,700
botnet a webmaster controls the series

1130
01:07:40,619 --> 01:07:47,099
of command and control servers and these

1131
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:53,578
command and control servers control a

1132
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:57,480
series of swipes and turn often known as

1133
01:07:53,579 --> 01:08:01,740
zombies these have been previously

1134
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:06,210
infected with malware and are waiting

1135
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:08,910
the command of the webmaster in order to

1136
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:12,089
perpetrate a denial of service attacks

1137
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:16,559
it is in this layer the zombie layer

1138
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:20,160
where we will focus our Droid Sentinel

1139
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:22,799
to activities due to this increase and

1140
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:25,679
denial of service attacks there's a

1141
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:29,250
great amount of uncertainty among users

1142
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:31,140
our our device has participated and

1143
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:33,060
coordinated our test this is a question

1144
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:35,670
that we often ask ourselves and the idea

1145
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:37,890
with these tool drawer Center demo is to

1146
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:40,319
answer this question it's a very simple

1147
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:43,020
Android based tool that reports on a

1148
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,819
real-time basis and whether our device

1149
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:47,130
is part of this tool and what we can do

1150
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:49,529
to prevent this from happening so to

1151
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:52,739
this end it analyzes the outgoing

1152
01:08:49,529 --> 01:08:53,620
traffic from the device in search of

1153
01:08:52,738 --> 01:09:01,500
malicious

1154
01:08:53,620 --> 01:09:04,240
cities particularly those anomalous

1155
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:07,810
situations that are part of a

1156
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:13,510
denial-of-service attack so we want to

1157
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:16,450
go a step further as I was saying we're

1158
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:20,860
participating on projects with this tool

1159
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:23,439
we are addressing a specific okay so we

1160
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:26,920
want to go a step further it's a gadget

1161
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:29,679
that could be used in the future and

1162
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:33,029
could be implemented in Internet of the

1163
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:35,620
Mangusta devices like fridges with

1164
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:39,009
denial of service attack done with

1165
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:41,700
Miriam which is a botnet the Internet of

1166
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:48,630
Things with use but in this hackathon

1167
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:51,519
we're going to focus on Android devices

1168
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:53,380
what are we going to do this sobriquet

1169
01:09:51,520 --> 01:10:03,910
we're going to develop the application

1170
01:09:53,380 --> 01:10:06,160
from scratch we're going to search for

1171
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:08,769
malicious activities to determine

1172
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:11,260
whether our device is participating or

1173
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:13,690
not and a denial of service attack

1174
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:16,990
whether it's part of a botnet and we're

1175
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:22,120
going to study the outgoing flows from

1176
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:23,980
our application and we're going to also

1177
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:27,880
do a prediction of forecasts of the

1178
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:31,690
behavior we're going to obtain some

1179
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:33,610
values here the idea is to protect the

1180
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:35,110
behavior of the entropy of the

1181
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:37,660
information flow I don't have is clear

1182
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:40,809
that's it's on our side and before I

1183
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:43,590
conclude I like to thank hackathon and I

1184
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:48,120
like to wish you all the best of luck

1185
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:48,120
but I want us assurance

1186
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:59,199
oh now so you gotta say my name is

1187
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:03,299
Carlos from open screen I have a

1188
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:06,759
question for you have you thought about

1189
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:09,250
issuing locks from the denial of service

1190
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:12,190
attacks that you've discovered and the

1191
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:14,260
devices send those logs to antivirus who

1192
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:16,449
telecom companies so that they analyzed

1193
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:18,640
them and do something about it well we

1194
01:11:16,449 --> 01:11:20,259
hadn't thought about that we hadn't

1195
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,830
thought about reporting but we can issue

1196
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:26,469
a report that analyzes those gos attacks

1197
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:34,090
and Isis well that would be interesting

1198
01:11:26,469 --> 01:11:37,900
that's a good idea how do you know

1199
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:40,750
whether it's a real denial of service or

1200
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:42,599
just an increase in requests for an

1201
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:46,710
application and therefore legitimate

1202
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:52,239
well we're going to apply a prediction

1203
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:56,050
algorithms to determine whether it's a

1204
01:11:52,239 --> 01:12:00,900
mere increase in traffic from whether

1205
01:11:56,050 --> 01:12:04,480
we're talking about do s attack we use a

1206
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:07,179
series of methods we have a series of

1207
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:10,959
values that can be characterized by the

1208
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:14,020
user when using the app so whenever you

1209
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:15,880
exceed a specific threshold you can know

1210
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:19,960
that and our prediction measures the

1211
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:23,020
flows the incoming and outgoing traffic

1212
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,880
and based on the predictions and the

1213
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:27,850
thresholds we can know that it since

1214
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:30,310
it's based on several parameters not

1215
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:32,500
just about connecting to drive to unload

1216
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:34,690
something in that case there would be an

1217
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,699
increase in this size of packages but

1218
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:38,980
nothing the other parameters so the idea

1219
01:12:36,699 --> 01:12:41,949
to know behind this is to work with

1220
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:44,709
different parameters that was my

1221
01:12:41,949 --> 01:12:48,318
question to you the prediction

1222
01:12:44,710 --> 01:13:02,299
algorithms that you're going to use

1223
01:12:48,319 --> 01:13:04,669
for this - as I said Wow Sam we're

1224
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:09,289
currently working a project on the

1225
01:13:04,669 --> 01:13:13,089
security of 5g networks so we have wide

1226
01:13:09,289 --> 01:13:15,949
battery of awkward hold winter are Rema

1227
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:19,609
special move the typical walk with us

1228
01:13:15,949 --> 01:13:24,409
but we're still making our mind we like

1229
01:13:19,609 --> 01:13:29,899
a demos because it's very easy to adjust

1230
01:13:24,409 --> 01:13:32,089
the settings can be customized and but

1231
01:13:29,899 --> 01:13:33,619
this is something that is yet to be

1232
01:13:32,089 --> 01:13:37,879
decided by the team

1233
01:13:33,619 --> 01:13:40,459
okay we're let's move on to the next for

1234
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:43,129
your application to work is it necessary

1235
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:47,629
to have access to route yeah yes indeed

1236
01:13:43,129 --> 01:13:52,159
yes you would need access to route but

1237
01:13:47,629 --> 01:13:54,799
some devices yeah I know but sometimes

1238
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:57,259
access is difficult it's just a

1239
01:13:54,799 --> 01:14:00,079
prototype in any case at this stage we

1240
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:03,199
hope we can be scalable and the future

1241
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:07,058
button well as of today we do have that

1242
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:11,089
restraint because we would still have to

1243
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:12,709
analyze further data and yes as you said

1244
01:14:11,089 --> 01:14:16,969
we need to use hoot and that's a

1245
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:21,339
restraint any further questions okay

1246
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:25,119
here you go it's an easy question

1247
01:14:21,339 --> 01:14:28,760
well you partially answered regarding

1248
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:31,398
prediction device has to constantly

1249
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:33,799
analyze how are you going to delegate

1250
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:38,799
part of that analyzing activity to a

1251
01:14:33,799 --> 01:14:41,599
central server or the computation lies

1252
01:14:38,799 --> 01:14:44,959
exclusively in the Android device by the

1253
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:47,389
underlying tool I want you to understand

1254
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:50,539
the traffic and be seen a log and we

1255
01:14:47,389 --> 01:14:52,760
analyze traffic the idea is that we

1256
01:14:50,539 --> 01:14:55,159
don't use pickup but it would be

1257
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:57,499
equivalent to a pickup we analyze

1258
01:14:55,159 --> 01:15:00,589
traffic and erase it at the same time so

1259
01:14:57,499 --> 01:15:02,358
we reuse a small part of hard work but

1260
01:15:00,589 --> 01:15:04,489
we don't exploit all the storage

1261
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:07,819
capability because we clean as we

1262
01:15:04,489 --> 01:15:11,478
analyze on the goals as a suggestion for

1263
01:15:07,819 --> 01:15:16,489
you because you will eat up the

1264
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:18,649
batteries very fast instead of doing it

1265
01:15:16,489 --> 01:15:23,568
and the device you can send it to an

1266
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:26,539
external server and you will say battery

1267
01:15:23,569 --> 01:15:29,619
you can out service and you can access

1268
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:31,969
the inside route well thanks

1269
01:15:29,619 --> 01:15:35,539
well the route is not a problem with the

1270
01:15:31,969 --> 01:15:38,469
logs it's a problem regarding being us

1271
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:38,469
as a packages

1272
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:47,369
wonderful let's move on I have a

1273
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:48,730
question meantime you can take your seat

1274
01:15:47,369 --> 01:15:51,400
guys

1275
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:55,509
with this project now or have you

1276
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:58,710
already done something no you're gonna

1277
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:58,710
work from scratch okay

1278
01:16:09,109 --> 01:16:14,139
my butt make you an effective

1279
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,309
Nakano grace

1280
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:40,850
well hello we are the group with a

1281
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:43,910
strangest weirdest name move by Mexico

1282
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:47,330
my name is Carlos I'm here together with

1283
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:49,790
Valentin have yet enough in and we're

1284
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:52,519
going to improve a tool that already

1285
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:55,010
exists that is cooled Mall trail here

1286
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:58,940
you have a definition of this tool and

1287
01:16:55,010 --> 01:17:01,700
github the goal of this tool or the

1288
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:04,849
objective is to analyze all the data

1289
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:08,050
packages from my device and to determine

1290
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:13,640
whether some of these packages are

1291
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:19,210
malware and to alert the user through a

1292
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:20,870
window so what we do is download and

1293
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:23,150
local manner

1294
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:25,340
well the info and the idea is to know

1295
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:27,650
whether the package is malicious or not

1296
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:30,970
you use this tool the tool is wonderful

1297
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:34,490
I used it myself to monitor Linux

1298
01:17:30,970 --> 01:17:37,490
devices at home and I discovered many

1299
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:43,940
Bitcoin miners that were eating up my

1300
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:47,690
seed mu and inspite of discovering them

1301
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:50,570
I didn't know the underlying process yes

1302
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:52,160
mall trail informs you on the malicious

1303
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:54,799
package but you're unaware of the

1304
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:57,019
process that executes those packages so

1305
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,980
I installed it from zero from scratch

1306
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:04,270
but I decided that it would be very

1307
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:08,269
important for this tool to be able to

1308
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:12,590
detect the process and this allows you

1309
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:14,810
to do something about it to examine the

1310
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:17,450
process to eliminate it with you're

1311
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:19,850
unaware of the process there's not much

1312
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:22,750
that you can do so it's very important

1313
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:27,320
that we're able to have that information

1314
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:30,680
mall trail has a typical server sensor

1315
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:34,429
customer architecture by the sensor in

1316
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:36,980
this case does all the computing to know

1317
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:37,710
whether the packages the outgoing

1318
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,480
packages

1319
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:41,820
malicious and if that's the case that

1320
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:44,190
info sent to the server so what we would

1321
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:46,650
do with this screen which is just an

1322
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:51,169
example from github you can see

1323
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:56,219
malicious packages and all associated

1324
01:18:51,170 --> 01:19:00,390
info destination IPs and why you believe

1325
01:18:56,219 --> 01:19:01,820
it's malicious in a severity level as

1326
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:04,680
well

1327
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:09,630
tells you whether the militias of

1328
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:13,739
package is important or not asperity

1329
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:17,520
degree and then we will use this for our

1330
01:19:13,739 --> 01:19:21,299
response process the info on militia

1331
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:24,570
some packages doesn't include

1332
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:27,840
or specify the process and our goal is

1333
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:30,090
to include and this table the process

1334
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,040
and to be able to kill that process if

1335
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:35,670
you see the screen and it says high

1336
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:40,800
severity but you have no clue as to of

1337
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:45,420
what is the underlying process so that's

1338
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:50,400
Rico to be able to identifier detect the

1339
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:54,480
processes the goal is to transform the

1340
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:58,080
mail trail tool and to transform it into

1341
01:19:54,480 --> 01:20:03,718
an incident response tool to eliminate

1342
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:06,900
and also uninstall the file and the

1343
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:11,700
ideas that you can depending on the

1344
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:16,889
level of severity eliminate the process

1345
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:19,590
or send it to a server as for similar

1346
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:23,730
technologies that we've found well of

1347
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:29,280
course as I MS that correlate logs and

1348
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:32,179
us on IDs that scans all the packages

1349
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,889
for the network and tells you whether

1350
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:39,080
malicious elements have been detected

1351
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:43,490
our tool is targeted for SM

1352
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:46,730
because a big organization with si yeah

1353
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:49,340
will not benefit as much from this tool

1354
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:51,740
but SMEs that are interested in security

1355
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:56,570
and monitoring equipment but has a

1356
01:20:51,740 --> 01:21:00,710
limited budget and for security and they

1357
01:20:56,570 --> 01:21:02,990
don't have technicians that our exports

1358
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:04,730
is security well this is a good option

1359
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:08,059
for them because it will allow them to

1360
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:13,580
know whether their computers are

1361
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:15,920
infected other target audience groups

1362
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:18,680
are well basically everybody at home

1363
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:23,090
that is willing to have greater and

1364
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:25,490
security we began from scratch but mall

1365
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:29,210
trail is already an existing tool and

1366
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:31,880
analyzes the data packages and tells you

1367
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:34,990
whether it smaller or not but as I was

1368
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:38,270
saying our goal now is to be able to

1369
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:40,460
identify the underlying process but for

1370
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:43,280
the technical complexity that we've

1371
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:44,150
identified in this preliminary analysis

1372
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:47,210
well

1373
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:50,530
the operating system and my next for

1374
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:55,280
example can not correlate the process

1375
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:57,730
that for each data package because the

1376
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:00,259
metadata of sockets don't have that

1377
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:02,959
information so it's harder to know what

1378
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:07,100
package is sent by each process but we

1379
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:09,770
have a couple of ideas in mind you come

1380
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:12,440
up with other ideas or have any

1381
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:14,990
suggestions for us there will be you

1382
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:18,559
welcome and our ideas to implement this

1383
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:23,570
both for a Linux and for Windows for

1384
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:29,810
both operating systems well we wanted to

1385
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:33,639
make a short presentation and now we

1386
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:33,640
give you the four questions

1387
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:46,180
- I think that what he could do in the

1388
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:49,480
virtual freyal

1389
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:52,590
frog system see all the processes and

1390
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:55,690
there's an F D folder that have all the

1391
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:59,110
that has all the open sockets and you

1392
01:22:55,690 --> 01:23:03,040
can try to match those sockets with the

1393
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:06,759
sockets of malicious elements yes that's

1394
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:09,070
our idea also regarding Linux the

1395
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:11,170
problem is that that's very useful for

1396
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:14,740
TCP connections that are long you know

1397
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:17,410
the socket for the package but in the

1398
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:19,780
file descriptor of each process you need

1399
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:22,480
to look for that socket so if you have

1400
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:24,910
an LP connection and only sent one

1401
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,530
package the socket is opened one

1402
01:23:24,910 --> 01:23:28,630
millisecond and you don't have enough

1403
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:30,580
time to read all the file descriptors of

1404
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:35,710
the process and maybe you paralyze this

1405
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:38,890
or block this for each process well

1406
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:41,440
that's another option to constantly look

1407
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:43,600
for the processes and do like a cachet

1408
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:45,879
of tables yes you can also draw tables

1409
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:49,030
that's a good idea you but you're

1410
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:51,580
monitoring each process constantly in

1411
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:53,320
order to remove the table so you need to

1412
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:55,840
consider that the connection is last

1413
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:57,969
less than one millisecond so you should

1414
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,670
check each millisecond in each process

1415
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:03,300
it's a good idea we've considered it we

1416
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:06,300
make implement it but it's probably very

1417
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:06,300
resource-intensive

1418
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:19,190
I have a question when you verify

1419
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:23,960
packages are you going to conceal the

1420
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:27,559
connections some done with malicious IPS

1421
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:31,790
do you have reputation lists what

1422
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:34,130
Montreal does is to basically download a

1423
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:37,820
public database from different sources

1424
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:43,040
and compares or equates each of the

1425
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:46,250
packages and with this database so if

1426
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:49,040
you know that the destination IP is

1427
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:50,660
malicious well you will know that the

1428
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:53,060
package will be malicious so you do

1429
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:55,280
consult reputation list II have any

1430
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:58,190
references to reputation list well we

1431
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:59,780
download between 60 and 70 reputation

1432
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:01,580
list I could show you the legislature on

1433
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:04,160
I can give you some specific suggestions

1434
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:07,610
later on that will be very much

1435
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:12,580
appreciated thank you further questions

1436
01:25:07,610 --> 01:25:12,580
no white rabbit you have the floor now

1437
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:24,500
look astonishment as you get ready

1438
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:27,590
please interrupt me when you're ready

1439
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:32,480
go take the stage get everything ready

1440
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:34,070
please the idea with these presentations

1441
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:36,679
is that II understand that you have in

1442
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:38,509
total 8 minutes for their presentation

1443
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:40,850
and questions and during the final pitch

1444
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:42,350
for final presentations you will have 10

1445
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:45,050
minutes well you understand how much

1446
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:47,180
time available you have and the final

1447
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:49,820
picture final presentation we recommend

1448
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:52,310
you do a demo of the tool because that's

1449
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:54,259
more visual is easier to understand so

1450
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:57,350
make sure you handle the time well

1451
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:59,930
because 10 minutes fly when you explain

1452
01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:01,760
don't do you one we did this is the Dima

1453
01:25:59,930 --> 01:26:04,510
this is how it works

1454
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:06,350
so rehearse this and bear this in mind

1455
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:08,750
particularly those that haven't

1456
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:10,880
participated in previous hackathons that

1457
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:13,960
have gone through this know that time

1458
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:17,200
flies but this is a good example the

1459
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:19,210
and these 18 minutes or like our

1460
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:21,760
rehearsal in the end and the final

1461
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:24,430
presentation you will have 10 minutes

1462
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:27,550
after this team we will listen to Monta

1463
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:29,920
Huck so I start getting ready please -

1464
01:26:27,550 --> 01:26:36,990
sure a fast transition from one team to

1465
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:41,980
another are we ready

1466
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:45,309
gentlemen yes clearly we are any

1467
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:48,700
questions at this point regarding the

1468
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:51,780
hackathon in general now good let's move

1469
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:51,780
on to the next group

1470
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:47,980
when I saw the other say nosotros somos

1471
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:52,210
summer remember hello

1472
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:55,780
we're the members the white rabbit blog

1473
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:57,850
you probably know who you are it's the

1474
01:27:55,780 --> 01:28:01,300
first time however that we participated

1475
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:03,850
is hackathon we have project and

1476
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:05,620
monitors activities on social media it's

1477
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:06,190
called Harvey and chain we come from a

1478
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:10,120
blog

1479
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:14,469
my colleagues are Alberto we have 12

1480
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:17,380
others to the right 4 right BMO and

1481
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:20,080
myself one I'm here to introduce a

1482
01:28:17,380 --> 01:28:22,000
project on monitoring of social media

1483
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:24,430
not only Twitter like within this

1484
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,190
project but we want to broaden this

1485
01:28:24,430 --> 01:28:33,520
cover other social media Facebook

1486
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:36,839
Instagram and also other elements in

1487
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:39,040
order to try to commend those profiles

1488
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:42,220
I'll explain the features of

1489
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:44,530
functionalities our target audience what

1490
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:50,740
we've done and what we intended to do

1491
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:53,730
this is an open-source tool and the main

1492
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:56,650
goal is to develop a full profile of a

1493
01:28:53,730 --> 01:28:58,480
person through social media and

1494
01:28:56,650 --> 01:29:00,250
everything that we can find on the

1495
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:03,370
internet and this comes to complement

1496
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:06,820
what was said earlier all this fo is

1497
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:10,269
open source and phone exclusively immune

1498
01:29:06,820 --> 01:29:13,750
system this and the goal is to have 30

1499
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:17,710
billion asses of these profiles form and

1500
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:22,020
touches technicians we have a listen to

1501
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:24,630
the feedback up and touches technicians

1502
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:28,050
when designing our project we're going

1503
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:32,960
to work with a Twitter Facebook and

1504
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:37,350
Instagram and also Pasadena mix of other

1505
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:40,740
platforms and the idea is to detect info

1506
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:44,460
leaks and the filtration we're going to

1507
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:47,670
focus on specific profiles Harvey is a

1508
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:52,170
project that began some time ago but not

1509
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:56,490
in the form we're presenting now the

1510
01:29:52,170 --> 01:30:00,890
idea is to provide a service for

1511
01:29:56,490 --> 01:30:03,210
intelligence technicians applying OS int

1512
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:05,370
techniques and we want to help law

1513
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:07,680
enforcement agencies intelligence

1514
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:10,110
services and other private companies I

1515
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:13,590
want to use this for other purposes but

1516
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:18,929
our main objective is to be a useful

1517
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:20,910
tool for these communities innovation

1518
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:25,770
and originality

1519
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:28,380
we Fenton has a project Tim Foley Kerr

1520
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:31,290
that is mostly Twitter basis very good

1521
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:34,260
and then we have the oesn't framework

1522
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:39,900
which is an excel what we want to convey

1523
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:41,640
but it's info consolation system using

1524
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:45,299
those same techniques we want to add a

1525
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:48,510
new information sources social media we

1526
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:50,850
want to constantly add new elements we

1527
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:54,880
can add for example mundane and the

1528
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:57,130
different social media that well

1529
01:30:54,880 --> 01:31:00,010
be developed in the future we want to

1530
01:30:57,130 --> 01:31:03,699
integrate them in one sole project the

1531
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:05,889
idea is that in one single site we can

1532
01:31:03,699 --> 01:31:09,460
get the information to have a full

1533
01:31:05,889 --> 01:31:16,210
profile without having four in each

1534
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:20,440
social media and also to develop an

1535
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:23,830
intuitive platform for users and for

1536
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:25,989
intelligence analysts the work will not

1537
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:27,820
be to get this information but once we

1538
01:31:25,989 --> 01:31:31,870
get the information to be able to

1539
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:34,780
analyze it and link the different items

1540
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:37,510
present in the media so they can find

1541
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:40,230
what they're looking for and it would be

1542
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:43,510
a secondary objective once we have

1543
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:46,870
implemented this to make an intelligence

1544
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:51,280
about the program so that he can make a

1545
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:54,730
first analysis without the role of the

1546
01:31:51,280 --> 01:32:01,900
analyst but supporting their task the

1547
01:31:54,730 --> 01:32:05,199
general approach the project is entitled

1548
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:08,049
harbor but it uses Twitter we are going

1549
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:15,879
to integrate it with Facebook and

1550
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:19,620
Instagram in this project as I said with

1551
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:25,889
Facebook and Instagram we want to make a

1552
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:30,210
way to view the data analysis and data

1553
01:32:25,889 --> 01:32:33,219
sampling this is just the first

1554
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:37,980
screenshot so that through maps and

1555
01:32:33,219 --> 01:32:43,000
graphs we can show this information in a

1556
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:47,138
rather easy manner the complexity of the

1557
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:50,290
project we've been finding several

1558
01:32:47,139 --> 01:32:53,809
difficulties the problem is that twitter

1559
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:57,500
has very good api

1560
01:32:53,809 --> 01:32:58,849
but Facebook and Instagram things are

1561
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:03,469
more complex

1562
01:32:58,849 --> 01:33:06,679
we found unofficial api's but we want to

1563
01:33:03,469 --> 01:33:08,570
face focus it to web scrapping getting

1564
01:33:06,679 --> 01:33:12,559
the information manually from the

1565
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:15,769
profiles and integrating the data in our

1566
01:33:12,559 --> 01:33:19,309
tool and then the final thing is to

1567
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:21,710
present the information in a simple way

1568
01:33:19,309 --> 01:33:26,199
we should introduce all of this in a

1569
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:30,289
database in a homogeneous manner and

1570
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:32,719
realize it not for the sake of it but in

1571
01:33:30,289 --> 01:33:34,730
such a way that it would then be easy

1572
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:37,610
for the analyst it wouldn't make sense

1573
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:45,199
to extract all this information if it's

1574
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:49,009
not easy to be read about the

1575
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:51,530
scalability we need a full program but

1576
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:54,559
we would like to add new features in a

1577
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:58,489
simple manner we can add a linkage in

1578
01:33:54,559 --> 01:34:03,199
module or some others to complement the

1579
01:33:58,489 --> 01:34:06,230
tool something else and we believe is

1580
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:10,519
very interesting is the creation of an

1581
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:13,879
alert system in the dashboard or as with

1582
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:16,550
telegram that gives you ongoing

1583
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:19,010
information whether a profile has

1584
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:22,789
updated a new photograph or a new

1585
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:29,179
Twitter message they are monitoring

1586
01:34:22,789 --> 01:34:32,150
those profiles 24 / 7 and lastly we want

1587
01:34:29,179 --> 01:34:36,170
to use a single server with the users

1588
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:38,750
system in the platform so that everyone

1589
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:40,070
can just log in to the platform with a

1590
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:44,990
username

1591
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:49,299
and past work so they can create their

1592
01:34:44,990 --> 01:34:52,130
own objectives and this is the idea and

1593
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:56,690
this is the end of representation if you

1594
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:59,080
have questions we'll try to respond them

1595
01:34:56,690 --> 01:35:01,700
[Applause]

1596
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:03,950
when a circle or deceiver watts hi I'm

1597
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,840
Carlos from civil watcher I believe we

1598
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:10,160
have a similar project we can help each

1599
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:12,590
other then with a cup of coffee will can

1600
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:16,910
go on discussing but I have a question

1601
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:19,220
your main function is information X to

1602
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:21,410
get the information but what is the

1603
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:24,680
advantage of getting information from

1604
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:27,139
Instagram that is based in photography's

1605
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:33,170
hashtag descriptions and just a small

1606
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:35,870
biography okay I know what you mean in

1607
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:37,580
Twitter Facebook and Instagram we can be

1608
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:41,030
talking about the same thing there just

1609
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:46,610
M messages and images you can just make

1610
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:50,690
a mapping you can create a map twitter

1611
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:53,509
has geolocalization in its messages this

1612
01:35:50,690 --> 01:35:55,879
is not the case of Instagram although we

1613
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:59,270
might get this information to create

1614
01:35:55,880 --> 01:36:03,920
them up and trace it because the

1615
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:06,560
objective is the monitoring would QC is

1616
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:09,710
doing where when and this is quite

1617
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:13,610
important a picture can say many things

1618
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:18,290
about a person it doesn't need to have

1619
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:21,080
data all the metadata are probably in

1620
01:36:18,290 --> 01:36:26,240
Internet but is the analyst the person

1621
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:27,860
that is going to get the information get

1622
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:32,420
the information presented in the

1623
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:35,150
photographs hello I don't know if you

1624
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:38,090
can hear me I was gonna ask you two

1625
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:40,489
questions even though I've seen that

1626
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:45,060
this is a web portal

1627
01:36:40,489 --> 01:36:48,928
so you're gonna have a web portal and if

1628
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:51,540
the idea is to use another server to

1629
01:36:48,929 --> 01:36:54,329
provide a service or to have in-house

1630
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:59,159
server the dashboard is not implemented

1631
01:36:54,329 --> 01:37:02,639
yet is just a project the ideas we said

1632
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:04,650
for intelligence analyst we like things

1633
01:37:02,639 --> 01:37:06,329
in black would like to read the

1634
01:37:04,650 --> 01:37:09,388
information but this is not the

1635
01:37:06,329 --> 01:37:12,780
objective the objective is for another

1636
01:37:09,389 --> 01:37:16,380
person whose work is not to read it in

1637
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:18,119
such a way but to interpret the data and

1638
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:21,570
the objective is to make their life

1639
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:27,119
easier about the other question the idea

1640
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:28,650
is that we want to use a server but do

1641
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:32,969
you just run the program

1642
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:36,929
the idea is to indicate the user names

1643
01:37:32,969 --> 01:37:40,079
of the different media and the local

1644
01:37:36,929 --> 01:37:43,440
server creates the dashboard with all

1645
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:51,299
information capture so it could be used

1646
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:53,669
locally good morning

1647
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:59,849
what is the technologies you want to use

1648
01:37:53,670 --> 01:38:01,980
for scraping and he spoke about

1649
01:37:59,849 --> 01:38:06,210
information sources have you thought of

1650
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:08,459
Google I've been using Google's API I

1651
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:14,579
don't know if this would be useful for

1652
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:17,159
you or not about I mean I don't know if

1653
01:38:14,579 --> 01:38:19,920
any of you have what with Instagram or

1654
01:38:17,159 --> 01:38:23,848
Facebook api's but they are not as

1655
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:27,389
simple as Twitter the only way to get

1656
01:38:23,849 --> 01:38:31,530
the information especially in facebook

1657
01:38:27,389 --> 01:38:35,579
with the friends list and things become

1658
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:39,540
really complicated so the best way was

1659
01:38:35,579 --> 01:38:43,769
to automatize the process with some

1660
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:47,159
automatic devices automats while you're

1661
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:50,309
not working on this they get the profile

1662
01:38:47,159 --> 01:38:54,388
the full page with friends and this is

1663
01:38:50,309 --> 01:39:00,210
the idea but this is a manual scrapping

1664
01:38:54,389 --> 01:39:01,980
the you go you browse you find the page

1665
01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:03,449
and you get the information yeah but

1666
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:06,570
what technology are you going to be

1667
01:39:03,449 --> 01:39:12,540
using what technology have you been

1668
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:15,480
using everything is in Python everything

1669
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:19,050
is in Python I don't know if you know

1670
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:20,579
but selenium and phantom Jes are quite

1671
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:24,750
good that's what we were discussing

1672
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:26,460
yesterday in the hotel we were doing it

1673
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:29,610
in a more manual manner but we were

1674
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:34,369
advised to use phantom Jas and selenium

1675
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:37,889
and selenium for Python has a modular

1676
01:39:34,369 --> 01:39:39,739
yes we can think of it and I don't

1677
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:44,219
remember the other question about Google

1678
01:39:39,739 --> 01:39:46,290
have you thought of Google API because

1679
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:50,099
it has a great deal of information and

1680
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:54,659
the API is quite all right so far we

1681
01:39:50,099 --> 01:40:01,409
wanted to focus on the social media and

1682
01:39:54,659 --> 01:40:04,920
then in Google we have some we have

1683
01:40:01,409 --> 01:40:07,619
checked but on a later stage we will

1684
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:09,659
incorporate all sort of information but

1685
01:40:07,619 --> 01:40:11,308
we were basically focused on those three

1686
01:40:09,659 --> 01:40:14,449
social networks

1687
01:40:11,309 --> 01:40:14,449
another question

1688
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:24,590
the your project that looks great is

1689
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:27,200
very interesting this idea of tracing

1690
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:30,170
people through the information that

1691
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:31,910
themselves or third parties my load but

1692
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:34,880
whenever I see those applications I

1693
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:37,970
wonder about the number of people that

1694
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:40,340
use this information with not very clear

1695
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:42,620
objectives and it's true that there are

1696
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:45,040
several applications that are used to

1697
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:48,320
trace people have you thought about

1698
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:51,950
controlling the use to know who is

1699
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:54,980
accessing what information no we haven't

1700
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:59,030
thought of it they are open source the

1701
01:40:54,980 --> 01:41:03,379
objectives of people that may use this

1702
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:09,620
type of tools is open source anyone can

1703
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:19,580
access it the idea is to provide some

1704
01:41:09,620 --> 01:41:27,680
support to this police or law

1705
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:29,630
enforcement in so that of course it can

1706
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:33,010
be used to spy somebody else this is

1707
01:41:29,630 --> 01:41:33,010
something that you cannot avoid

1708
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:49,280
hello have you thought how you gonna

1709
01:41:43,699 --> 01:41:52,849
deal in facebook - with the system they

1710
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:56,239
have to avoid scraping well we haven't

1711
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:59,510
really found any difficulty we haven't

1712
01:41:56,239 --> 01:42:01,428
got any problem with Facebook because we

1713
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:03,650
were doing too many requests or

1714
01:42:01,429 --> 01:42:07,750
restricting too much information what

1715
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:11,989
we're doing is reading with an HTML and

1716
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:12,800
analyze it so now basically we haven't

1717
01:42:11,989 --> 01:42:17,269
had any problem

1718
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:20,719
well I found web service that when you

1719
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:22,730
do requests they interrupt you for some

1720
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:25,969
time that happens with Twitter I don't

1721
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:28,370
know the next number of requests and I'm

1722
01:42:25,969 --> 01:42:31,100
sure Instagram is the same but those are

1723
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:33,110
not requests it's just getting

1724
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:36,640
information directly from the website

1725
01:42:33,110 --> 01:42:40,880
I'm sure Facebook has some anti scraping

1726
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:43,880
that's why it might be interesting if

1727
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,860
you can implement a distributed scraping

1728
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:50,150
system from different IPS to avoid a

1729
01:42:45,860 --> 01:42:53,750
situation or just a wait time it will be

1730
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:58,009
boring but the idea would be distributed

1731
01:42:53,750 --> 01:43:02,000
yeah then it cuts and it reboots we will

1732
01:42:58,010 --> 01:43:04,040
see we haven't thought of it we haven't

1733
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,110
developed this part yet one with

1734
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:12,739
encountered a situation we will contact

1735
01:43:06,110 --> 01:43:18,620
you thank you okay we have to stop here

1736
01:43:12,739 --> 01:43:23,599
and monster-hug is the next team not a

1737
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:26,780
lot of just some clarification to be

1738
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:32,810
nice to the duty does not give you any

1739
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:35,019
more appoints I'm speaking about the

1740
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:35,020
name

1741
01:43:56,949 --> 01:44:06,949
let me impress a preparer while they get

1742
01:44:00,019 --> 01:44:12,229
ready there are three more teams even

1743
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:20,449
though is 12 but we still have time and

1744
01:44:12,229 --> 01:44:24,760
the 12:30 so we should have enough time

1745
01:44:20,449 --> 01:44:28,268
to so that you can all go to the panel

1746
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:28,269
whenever you're ready

1747
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:41,799
they London

1748
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:48,510
microphone please

1749
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:48,510
[Music]

1750
01:44:49,130 --> 01:44:55,700
we are the Mancha team we are a student

1751
01:44:52,040 --> 01:45:04,220
in secondary education we have two

1752
01:44:55,700 --> 01:45:06,769
university students and one the is not

1753
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:08,690
working but a not student but one

1754
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:12,860
country Masterson we're going to do a

1755
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:18,410
cryptographic library based on a cipher

1756
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:21,110
algorithm the cha-cha designed by Daniel

1757
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:24,019
bird stain an important person in the

1758
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:27,639
world of cyber security the name is just

1759
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:32,030
Shasha all the functions are based on

1760
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:37,910
discipline and it refers to the dancing

1761
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:41,360
I don't like the name we will see

1762
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:47,180
whether we can implement dice but so far

1763
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:51,410
this is the projects pace the goat we

1764
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:56,210
are doing the code with the exception of

1765
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:59,710
dance and see in standard input/output

1766
01:45:56,210 --> 01:46:03,020
we don't but in relation to the Shasha

1767
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:10,820
algorithm and the rest we have done it

1768
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:14,660
ourselves basically we look for an easy

1769
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:19,730
to understand code when we see codes

1770
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:22,490
from other algorithm as md5 or goes in

1771
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:26,419
the RFC they are very baroque and

1772
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:30,440
complex so we're looking for code that

1773
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:33,620
is easy to be understood basically it

1774
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:37,460
implements Safran and because it's a

1775
01:46:33,620 --> 01:46:44,340
flow cycling algorithm we can use the

1776
01:46:37,460 --> 01:46:47,530
upload as system that is

1777
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:54,190
secured as a possible example for its

1778
01:46:47,530 --> 01:47:01,330
use and a possible API we are doing a

1779
01:46:54,190 --> 01:47:04,178
scheme of client server where client and

1780
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:07,269
servers exchange keys through the

1781
01:47:04,179 --> 01:47:11,800
Shantae cipher the messages through

1782
01:47:07,270 --> 01:47:16,679
Sascha also and the random numbers used

1783
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:18,580
for Safran we need this entropy and

1784
01:47:16,679 --> 01:47:20,920
randomness

1785
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:26,739
they are both based in session they also

1786
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:29,110
implement parcel is thought and this you

1787
01:47:26,739 --> 01:47:33,659
will be able to see it in the

1788
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:38,009
application this is a view about a code

1789
01:47:33,659 --> 01:47:45,960
that can be cipher using our library

1790
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:52,300
here the library is not compiled and

1791
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:56,429
then you have to indicate the files the

1792
01:47:52,300 --> 01:47:59,710
corresponding files to the library the

1793
01:47:56,429 --> 01:48:07,860
file that has the core of the algorithm

1794
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:11,440
and the file that contains the ciphering

1795
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:15,960
implementation we have a core that is

1796
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:20,259
shared by the ciphering and some others

1797
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:26,199
so here we think that introducing the

1798
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:30,400
chain once is cipher we have this second

1799
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:33,009
chain I don't know if you know how extra

1800
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:37,509
decimal codes go but they do not

1801
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:40,960
correspond obviously we need D ciphering

1802
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:47,800
or decoding and as you can see is not

1803
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:54,610
too complex and this is the message

1804
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:58,670
in the code we have the this output and

1805
01:48:54,610 --> 01:49:01,820
we have the original message which only

1806
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:07,430
says this is a message this is an

1807
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:12,320
implementation of the CS PRNG

1808
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:20,470
juice in 100 random numbers with the

1809
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:23,530
seed of 44 bytes opposite the

1810
01:49:20,470 --> 01:49:28,060
implementation of the random function

1811
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:28,059
this is more secure

1812
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:39,350
MCC uses 32 bytes since this is use a

1813
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:41,719
huge amount of bytes is extremely secure

1814
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:48,500
and that's why is used for cryptological

1815
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:51,290
use here we see how we generate 100

1816
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:55,700
random numbers and it's also interesting

1817
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:58,970
to see that it behaves the same as and

1818
01:49:55,700 --> 01:50:01,190
see see the same seed will generate the

1819
01:49:58,970 --> 01:50:03,620
same sequence that's why different calls

1820
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:07,219
to the program generates the same

1821
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:13,940
sequence and applications this is a very

1822
01:50:07,220 --> 01:50:16,910
life support are piranha crazy on the

1823
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:20,419
viruses we can use it for the creation

1824
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:26,630
of viruses and shellcodes is not very

1825
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:30,440
huge once utens later the code of the

1826
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:35,640
course has a function to the and sampler

1827
01:50:30,440 --> 01:50:40,150
there are not many codes this is

1828
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:46,080
can be hosted in a buffer otherwise we

1829
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:52,049
can use an air hunter and is is quite

1830
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:55,019
much you can modify it and also as we

1831
01:50:52,050 --> 01:50:58,560
implement cryptographic functions

1832
01:50:55,020 --> 01:51:01,630
official implementations are difficult

1833
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:03,460
understand it would be easier to help

1834
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:11,170
the understanding of those functions and

1835
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:15,730
this is do have any questions do you

1836
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:18,070
have questions okay I would like to know

1837
01:51:15,730 --> 01:51:22,450
what you get the seat from this it can

1838
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:26,349
be used and get this is the customer I

1839
01:51:22,450 --> 01:51:30,849
didn't say this is thought or the target

1840
01:51:26,350 --> 01:51:33,760
would be developers because his library

1841
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:40,360
is a library depending on the system you

1842
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:44,710
have a secure seed in Linux from - ref -

1843
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:48,519
random in Windows you have an apiary I

1844
01:51:44,710 --> 01:51:52,810
don't know exactly how this API works is

1845
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:56,620
treated in some Linux distributions they

1846
01:51:52,810 --> 01:52:01,630
use the function they use not in random

1847
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:06,010
but they use treasure in BSD is no Linux

1848
01:52:01,630 --> 01:52:12,940
exactly but they use Charles own and I

1849
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:17,140
don't know you can connect radio system

1850
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:20,559
that is a schema and you read from its

1851
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:23,530
leg and electromagnetic interactions are

1852
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:26,260
random enough and not predictable

1853
01:52:23,530 --> 01:52:28,150
so they can be secure depending on the

1854
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:31,559
system the programmer is using they can

1855
01:52:28,150 --> 01:52:33,480
get a secure seed

1856
01:52:31,559 --> 01:52:38,579
any other question do we have more

1857
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:41,638
questions okay I'm gonna ask you

1858
01:52:38,579 --> 01:52:43,949
something how are you doing what part is

1859
01:52:41,639 --> 01:52:50,400
already done and what is still pending

1860
01:52:43,949 --> 01:52:59,730
okay I'm not going to explain too much

1861
01:52:50,400 --> 01:53:00,690
now okay so far we have the core without

1862
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:05,129
that it works

1863
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:08,098
sighs - and this - is ready we just want

1864
01:53:05,130 --> 01:53:12,780
to implement the improvements the areas

1865
01:53:08,099 --> 01:53:18,079
and the code is made by us following

1866
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:26,420
standards we've also implemented as ha1

1867
01:53:18,079 --> 01:53:30,179
for checksum in the client-server schema

1868
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:33,690
about the API is already ready yes the

1869
01:53:30,179 --> 01:53:37,710
client-server scheme is already there

1870
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:40,949
and the parcel is easy to set it works

1871
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:47,389
through Python through the Python

1872
01:53:40,949 --> 01:53:54,360
library Python that age you can execute

1873
01:53:47,389 --> 01:53:57,239
patents built so the user can simply set

1874
01:53:54,360 --> 01:54:01,589
the parcel with IP addresses and

1875
01:53:57,239 --> 01:54:04,409
everything works you must prevent us are

1876
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:10,619
there more questions please better grip

1877
01:54:04,409 --> 01:54:12,659
get ready locate the nearest I what I've

1878
01:54:10,619 --> 01:54:17,329
seen so far would you cipher and

1879
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:20,280
decipher with your application are just

1880
01:54:17,329 --> 01:54:25,259
messages through a command-line - you

1881
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:27,059
have support to transmit data flow or

1882
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:30,809
have you thought about implementing it

1883
01:54:27,059 --> 01:54:32,129
flows it could be a good idea but I was

1884
01:54:30,809 --> 01:54:40,559
thinking

1885
01:54:32,129 --> 01:54:43,108
for the iut world you can simply send an

1886
01:54:40,559 --> 01:54:45,659
order to a device that's the idea he

1887
01:54:43,109 --> 01:54:49,999
sent an order and the problem with IOT

1888
01:54:45,659 --> 01:54:54,688
it was in the 80s there was not Safran

1889
01:54:49,999 --> 01:54:58,309
or encryption it's very simple that you

1890
01:54:54,689 --> 01:55:01,260
can run in any system there are not our

1891
01:54:58,309 --> 01:55:07,019
keys they're just easy calculations

1892
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:11,010
based on addition rotation and XOR and

1893
01:55:07,019 --> 01:55:13,229
it could be a good idea we will continue

1894
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:14,669
discussing about this for project

1895
01:55:13,229 --> 01:55:16,769
there's one part and that's the reason

1896
01:55:14,669 --> 01:55:18,869
of my question but maybe we can discuss

1897
01:55:16,769 --> 01:55:23,070
later and we could collaborate with your

1898
01:55:18,869 --> 01:55:30,148
application PS a please come to the

1899
01:55:23,070 --> 01:55:35,759
panel now is clear for the URI you have

1900
01:55:30,149 --> 01:55:38,609
a great work already done so you just

1901
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:44,939
have to continue on the line sound of

1902
01:55:38,609 --> 01:55:49,399
the question now they say a gripped and

1903
01:55:44,939 --> 01:55:54,419
then Marwar scanners the last two teams

1904
01:55:49,399 --> 01:55:56,449
are individual ones in this script

1905
01:55:54,419 --> 01:55:59,010
without representation they will just

1906
01:55:56,449 --> 01:56:05,249
speak about the project and you know is

1907
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:09,349
also related to crypto technology it

1908
01:56:05,249 --> 01:56:09,349
will be faster with our representation

1909
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:27,030
good morning to everyone i am alexandra

1910
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:33,380
Padrino the tool i will present the name

1911
01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:37,170
is secure has this tool is developed

1912
01:56:33,380 --> 01:56:44,310
based on two prior projects that do not

1913
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:51,330
belong the open source community and the

1914
01:56:44,310 --> 01:57:00,360
main features the has stores timely

1915
01:56:51,330 --> 01:57:03,780
information of the chain or file that

1916
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:08,630
will be generated by the haas you store

1917
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:14,429
the name and you can also store the file

1918
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:16,640
it also present the check who does not

1919
01:57:14,429 --> 01:57:19,590
revealed really information so is a

1920
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:28,980
secure hardware information can only be

1921
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:33,590
decoded from the user that has the right

1922
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:33,589
information and

1923
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:46,510
is a console application without

1924
01:57:38,810 --> 01:57:46,510
frameworks and it can be easily used

1925
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:55,340
they duel was developed in xbase

1926
01:57:52,190 --> 01:58:06,589
compiler environment you can use some

1927
01:57:55,340 --> 01:58:10,720
other environments it also be developing

1928
01:58:06,590 --> 01:58:13,610
different languages its source code

1929
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:15,380
shows no difficulties to develop it in

1930
01:58:13,610 --> 01:58:20,380
other languages I'd use the one I use

1931
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:24,230
because is easier for me to program and

1932
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:31,450
and this is the end of my presentation

1933
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:37,910
so if you have any questions hunters

1934
01:58:31,450 --> 01:58:42,320
questions I have one question

1935
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:46,309
why a new house do we need a new house

1936
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:49,070
it provides new functionalities in the

1937
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:54,530
house that are not the case and the

1938
01:58:49,070 --> 01:58:57,790
current ones that just check what you

1939
01:58:54,530 --> 01:59:02,040
want to test

1940
01:58:57,790 --> 01:59:04,920
I forgot to say that this project I

1941
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:09,730
don't know about other similar projects

1942
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:15,700
and is not developed from scratch

1943
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:18,820
I was based on an existing project and

1944
01:59:15,700 --> 01:59:24,970
then I will add some new functionalities

1945
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:29,139
to check that everything is ok another

1946
01:59:24,970 --> 01:59:32,380
thing that I didn't mention is that the

1947
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:35,890
house has a comprehensive security level

1948
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:41,170
is ciphered and all information is

1949
01:59:35,890 --> 01:59:42,790
broken down in three parts and any of

1950
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:47,650
the parts can be decoded without the

1951
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:49,900
previous one so you can defeat the first

1952
01:59:47,650 --> 01:59:56,530
part of the house to show a different

1953
01:59:49,900 --> 02:00:03,910
time or date from the original one but

1954
01:59:56,530 --> 02:00:08,620
not always if the manual amendment is

1955
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:11,470
too high or too different

1956
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:13,570
you will not be able to check the first

1957
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:19,740
part and the other two that depend on

1958
02:00:13,570 --> 02:00:22,660
the first will not be decoded what

1959
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:25,450
specific functionality are you gonna be

1960
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:33,180
working in during that weekend I will

1961
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:35,830
try to fine tune the string exit screen

1962
02:00:33,180 --> 02:00:38,320
functionality I don't know if is a

1963
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:46,720
problem of the compiler but sometimes it

1964
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:53,500
shows bizarre characters I also try to

1965
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:58,180
improve file treatment systems if you

1966
02:00:53,500 --> 02:01:04,420
use data block that is too big you can

1967
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:10,120
block the whole system and this

1968
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:14,170
application will be targeted to security

1969
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:15,930
companies banking industry military the

1970
02:01:14,170 --> 02:01:19,870
army

1971
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:23,980
good morning just a question what is the

1972
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:27,580
computational complexity is the calculus

1973
02:01:23,980 --> 02:01:31,360
very costly sheet light compared to the

1974
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:34,990
C language no I'm talking about the

1975
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:41,009
house compared to other houses the

1976
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:41,010
Hassan generated is higher in its

1977
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:50,380
speaking from the its length and it

1978
02:01:47,110 --> 02:01:55,780
depends on would you wish to introduce

1979
02:01:50,380 --> 02:01:59,680
you can introduce the file the same file

1980
02:01:55,780 --> 02:02:03,519
that generated the house so if this is a

1981
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:07,210
function that when stored in the name of

1982
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:10,390
the file or the characters chain that

1983
02:02:07,210 --> 02:02:14,800
you want to check it gives you the

1984
02:02:10,390 --> 02:02:18,730
possibility to internally store the file

1985
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:21,060
in the house is applied to the low level

1986
02:02:18,730 --> 02:02:21,059
right

1987
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:29,730
can you speak up please is somewhere

1988
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:32,429
between the Husson algorithm the siphon

1989
02:02:29,730 --> 02:02:35,190
what you're proposing this is for

1990
02:02:32,429 --> 02:02:38,100
another reason this project as I said

1991
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:41,699
before it's based on two previous

1992
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:44,219
projects out of a communications

1993
02:02:41,699 --> 02:02:47,940
protocol that I designed 16 years ago

1994
02:02:44,219 --> 02:02:50,460
and when you do a house in such a way

1995
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:53,309
that seems to be a bit complex but what

1996
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:55,260
is easy is that the house can be used as

1997
02:02:53,310 --> 02:03:00,270
part of a communications protocol that

1998
02:02:55,260 --> 02:03:04,980
is one of my final objectives giunta's

1999
02:03:00,270 --> 02:03:14,909
do we have more questions next malware

2000
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:25,530
scanner no more questions okay with the

2001
02:03:14,909 --> 02:03:29,219
more projects malware scanner HDMI after

2002
02:03:25,530 --> 02:03:33,599
this presentation you will have time to

2003
02:03:29,219 --> 02:03:38,010
move over to the hackathon area you'll

2004
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:41,520
have to find your table your workstation

2005
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:45,889
get settled and we will be there to help

2006
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:45,889
you out even need it before lunch

2007
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:55,999
de nuevo mientras connect emotionally

2008
02:03:52,670 --> 02:03:58,809
wounded any further questions regarding

2009
02:03:55,999 --> 02:04:03,249
the competition in general now

2010
02:03:58,809 --> 02:04:03,249
everything's clear crystal clear

2011
02:04:10,760 --> 02:04:16,139
when a questioners makeup what I kick

2012
02:04:13,909 --> 02:04:18,690
thank you everybody for your

2013
02:04:16,139 --> 02:04:20,849
participation it was one of the

2014
02:04:18,690 --> 02:04:23,848
objectives but of course we didn't know

2015
02:04:20,849 --> 02:04:26,849
whether you were going to contribute and

2016
02:04:23,849 --> 02:04:29,130
we're happy to see that you're

2017
02:04:26,849 --> 02:04:31,170
collaborating that you're giving tips

2018
02:04:29,130 --> 02:04:34,710
and suggestions and that we're creating

2019
02:04:31,170 --> 02:04:36,510
more of a community in this edition so

2020
02:04:34,710 --> 02:04:40,729
thanks everybody for breaking the ice

2021
02:04:36,510 --> 02:04:40,729
and pour contributing with your feedback

2022
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:12,480
can you hear me good morning my name is

2023
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:19,799
Samuel puppy I'm a development teacher I

2024
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:22,790
actually teach watching and I am here

2025
02:05:19,800 --> 02:05:27,270
presenter presenting a malware scanner

2026
02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:31,890
but it's web oriented the main goal of

2027
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:34,730
this scanners to scan a site that has

2028
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:37,200
already been compromised I have a

2029
02:05:34,730 --> 02:05:41,099
wordpress or a website and I've been

2030
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:45,679
attacked because I don't have it well

2031
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:53,730
protected and the idea is to develop

2032
02:05:45,680 --> 02:05:57,180
tool to clean that website I teach but

2033
02:05:53,730 --> 02:06:01,950
sometimes I need to battle against

2034
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:05,820
wordpress and wordpress sites are easy

2035
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:09,510
to attack and I found injected a code

2036
02:06:05,820 --> 02:06:13,679
that then generates up spam and block

2037
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:16,770
the server and if you look on the

2038
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:18,960
Internet there are many web pages that

2039
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:21,750
tell you how you need to clean it and

2040
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:25,590
the idea with this tool is to have this

2041
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:32,730
if it works well that is able to look

2042
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:35,520
out for malicious content injected

2043
02:06:32,730 --> 02:06:37,980
script to disick that to clean that and

2044
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:40,530
so then the website could continue

2045
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:43,669
operating

2046
02:06:40,530 --> 02:06:43,670
[Music]

2047
02:06:45,179 --> 02:06:50,050
many times when you have a wordpress

2048
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:52,300
everything is in the database and you

2049
02:06:50,050 --> 02:06:55,300
can decide well instead of pinning to

2050
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:57,730
reinstall well the idea is to not have

2051
02:06:55,300 --> 02:06:59,110
to do this not have to reinstall to

2052
02:06:57,730 --> 02:07:01,780
eliminate this script

2053
02:06:59,110 --> 02:07:05,259
the initial idea is to do this as a

2054
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:07,659
command line so you tell the time you

2055
02:07:05,260 --> 02:07:11,619
tell that through the type of weather

2056
02:07:07,659 --> 02:07:16,019
you have and for the tool to clean this

2057
02:07:11,619 --> 02:07:16,019
without having to do any of the steps

2058
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:21,670
using a mask well some time ago I

2059
02:07:20,199 --> 02:07:29,559
thought about this because I was

2060
02:07:21,670 --> 02:07:34,780
manually cleaning WordPress segments of

2061
02:07:29,560 --> 02:07:37,330
text who I was very homemade and even

2062
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:39,790
systems administrators that have

2063
02:07:37,330 --> 02:07:43,239
websites of the server that can be

2064
02:07:39,790 --> 02:07:46,330
vulnerable and the idea is to be able to

2065
02:07:43,239 --> 02:07:49,629
clean that way because the fact that we

2066
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:53,530
have the web infected can saturate our

2067
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:58,260
email server and the idea is to recover

2068
02:07:53,530 --> 02:07:58,259
the command of the entire system I

2069
02:07:58,679 --> 02:08:06,040
explained to you how this idea came to

2070
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:14,469
my mind in the past I tried out some

2071
02:08:06,040 --> 02:08:16,750
tools I don't know whether it was me

2072
02:08:14,469 --> 02:08:20,830
because I wasn't able to use it well or

2073
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:22,810
maybe because the tools weren't able to

2074
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:25,540
detect everything I don't know the

2075
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:29,260
reason but they didn't prove useful for

2076
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:34,210
me so the idea is to develop a tomb a to

2077
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:37,270
focus on cleaning viruses and also the

2078
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:39,099
type of website in order to detect

2079
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:40,989
generate the files that shouldn't be

2080
02:08:39,099 --> 02:08:44,650
there and to compare this with the

2081
02:08:40,989 --> 02:08:46,509
original files and a Content Manager can

2082
02:08:44,650 --> 02:08:48,909
have I think there are some tools out

2083
02:08:46,510 --> 02:08:51,639
there code where that does something

2084
02:08:48,909 --> 02:08:56,790
similar does backups of your web page

2085
02:08:51,639 --> 02:09:02,199
regularly and if they detect changes

2086
02:08:56,790 --> 02:09:06,880
they report you on those changes there's

2087
02:09:02,199 --> 02:09:08,949
another tool out there that monitors and

2088
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:12,550
here you can see a detailed description

2089
02:09:08,949 --> 02:09:15,280
I would like to monitor websites to be

2090
02:09:12,550 --> 02:09:16,889
able to report on new files in order to

2091
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:19,809
take action if needed

2092
02:09:16,889 --> 02:09:21,909
as for the state of play I'm not

2093
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:25,360
starting from scratch I was starting

2094
02:09:21,909 --> 02:09:29,098
from one not from zero because the day

2095
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:32,019
before yesterday I began working on this

2096
02:09:29,099 --> 02:09:36,580
the program is done in peyten

2097
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:40,210
why use Python because this is object

2098
02:09:36,580 --> 02:09:42,489
oriented and I'm an object-oriented

2099
02:09:40,210 --> 02:09:43,929
development this is the field in which I

2100
02:09:42,489 --> 02:09:46,269
feel comfortable this is a language that

2101
02:09:43,929 --> 02:09:50,460
is after user security and it gave me

2102
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:55,630
the option to use a weapon to use

2103
02:09:50,460 --> 02:09:58,469
young I also wanted to be able to own

2104
02:09:55,630 --> 02:10:02,520
this two words the web interface and

2105
02:09:58,469 --> 02:10:08,880
right now it's a command it has some

2106
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:08,880
functionalities if I scanned some sides

2107
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:18,280
directories content and within files but

2108
02:10:14,889 --> 02:10:23,070
still isn't able to do anything the only

2109
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:27,880
thing that does is to skin test

2110
02:10:23,070 --> 02:10:30,880
WordPress it also scans dictionaries

2111
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:33,820
let's say templates of files that

2112
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:35,210
shouldn't be there and yesterday night I

2113
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:38,269
tried

2114
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:42,230
to have this compared with a clean let's

2115
02:10:38,270 --> 02:10:46,340
say setup to see what file shouldn't be

2116
02:10:42,230 --> 02:10:48,910
there I will have perhaps have to do

2117
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:57,560
backups of my own personalized besides

2118
02:10:48,910 --> 02:11:01,690
there's much to be done any case and I

2119
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:07,880
can add dropper Julie Magento and other

2120
02:11:01,690 --> 02:11:10,580
content managers and to have a web

2121
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:12,740
interface to interact more easily in

2122
02:11:10,580 --> 02:11:14,660
those files that have content let's

2123
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:17,420
imagine that we inject code we need to

2124
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:20,860
eliminate a remove fragment of code

2125
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:23,360
it'll be easy to manage from the web the

2126
02:11:20,860 --> 02:11:25,219
architecture needs to be scalable and

2127
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:28,400
extendable the idea that people can

2128
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:30,200
collaborate and if people believe that

2129
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:32,059
it can be used for other content

2130
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:35,120
administrators the ideas that we can

2131
02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:37,850
have plugins to scale it up to continue

2132
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:40,990
developing it without its problems and

2133
02:11:37,850 --> 02:11:42,770
other things that I believe it can do

2134
02:11:40,990 --> 02:11:47,230
Julie cut it out

2135
02:11:42,770 --> 02:11:52,010
to use the signatures from wasp on

2136
02:11:47,230 --> 02:11:55,759
malware scanning that has database with

2137
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:58,330
signatures of viruses and exploits that

2138
02:11:55,760 --> 02:12:01,520
are well-known in order to be able to

2139
02:11:58,330 --> 02:12:05,230
conduct our search and the website into

2140
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:05,230
associated to what I'm doing

2141
02:12:08,849 --> 02:12:15,429
and other areas that I thought to

2142
02:12:12,579 --> 02:12:18,009
broaden the dictionary of signatures and

2143
02:12:15,429 --> 02:12:19,840
even upload this and the class so that

2144
02:12:18,010 --> 02:12:23,889
it can be collaborative and it can grow

2145
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:26,760
to do remote scanning to improve the

2146
02:12:23,889 --> 02:12:29,559
interface and then the monitoring option

2147
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:32,199
that it would be would be interesting to

2148
02:12:29,559 --> 02:12:34,959
monitor the web so that when changes

2149
02:12:32,199 --> 02:12:38,348
minimal changes even are detected we can

2150
02:12:34,959 --> 02:12:40,479
act fast and respond swiftly and that's

2151
02:12:38,349 --> 02:12:51,489
it is for the presentation you have any

2152
02:12:40,479 --> 02:12:58,510
questions I'll be happy to answer make

2153
02:12:51,489 --> 02:13:02,339
it easy please it's a question sorry

2154
02:12:58,510 --> 02:13:02,340
it's hard to hear it's hard to hear

2155
02:13:03,030 --> 02:13:06,410
[Music]

2156
02:13:08,250 --> 02:13:20,330
I have a doubt you want to have this

2157
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:27,030
locally together with WordPress servers

2158
02:13:20,330 --> 02:13:30,269
my main ideas that I observed the system

2159
02:13:27,030 --> 02:13:34,230
administrator I see the infected web and

2160
02:13:30,270 --> 02:13:38,510
I execute the command and I pass on the

2161
02:13:34,230 --> 02:13:42,089
type of root it is it scares the place

2162
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:45,740
looks for injected code files that

2163
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:45,740
shouldn't be there because they have

2164
02:13:46,010 --> 02:13:54,740
opinions as automated as possible maybe

2165
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:58,200
you should have an external device

2166
02:13:54,740 --> 02:14:00,780
because most WordPress are in shared

2167
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:07,139
sites that don't give you freedom when

2168
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:09,210
executing anything yep that's what I

2169
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:12,570
mentioned when I said remote scanning

2170
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:14,760
that's a very good idea because lots of

2171
02:14:12,570 --> 02:14:18,240
people have it in shared hosting they

2172
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:21,840
don't have console based on posting that

2173
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:23,910
was one of my ideas had 1000 I didn't

2174
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:26,790
know whether they were good or bad but

2175
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:28,530
if do you agree well that's good it's a

2176
02:14:26,790 --> 02:14:36,600
way of backing on my idea thank you very

2177
02:14:28,530 --> 02:14:38,340
much like a little companion well I have

2178
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:42,110
the same question as the colleague who

2179
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:42,110
took the four minute ago

2180
02:14:43,790 --> 02:14:51,210
I'll get closer I promise

2181
02:14:46,889 --> 02:14:54,829
I had a first question on shared hosting

2182
02:14:51,210 --> 02:14:58,139
and second question you probably use

2183
02:14:54,829 --> 02:15:00,150
reacts to detect the currency of whether

2184
02:14:58,139 --> 02:15:02,790
it's malicious or not and you probably

2185
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:07,530
considered different types of languages

2186
02:15:02,790 --> 02:15:10,679
depending on the CMS and whether it's

2187
02:15:07,530 --> 02:15:13,619
office cater or not what I've done I'm

2188
02:15:10,679 --> 02:15:15,900
another now my focus is on WordPress as

2189
02:15:13,619 --> 02:15:19,290
I was saying which is what I know best

2190
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:23,900
I mean I'm I don't have up in WordPress

2191
02:15:19,290 --> 02:15:26,219
but I've cleaned WordPress sites

2192
02:15:23,900 --> 02:15:28,769
regarding other languages I haven't

2193
02:15:26,219 --> 02:15:32,790
thought about anything because all those

2194
02:15:28,770 --> 02:15:37,159
that I mentioned our PHP s-- and as for

2195
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:40,889
office gated code I've seen that it was

2196
02:15:37,159 --> 02:15:45,329
complicated it's messy but I haven't

2197
02:15:40,889 --> 02:15:47,489
decided anything sometimes I see great

2198
02:15:45,329 --> 02:15:53,299
amount of code that is impossible to

2199
02:15:47,489 --> 02:15:56,579
read and sometimes I see that there is

2200
02:15:53,300 --> 02:16:02,690
legitimately injected coat but manually

2201
02:15:56,579 --> 02:16:05,670
I've detected ugly files but that we're

2202
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:09,449
legitimate files that's a good idea in

2203
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:11,579
any case thanks for your suggestion last

2204
02:16:09,449 --> 02:16:16,348
question because we're going to be

2205
02:16:11,579 --> 02:16:19,320
kicked out hello

2206
02:16:16,349 --> 02:16:21,119
the idea is very interesting thinking

2207
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:24,599
about the project do you think it's

2208
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:29,969
feasible for example to do this in a

2209
02:16:24,599 --> 02:16:40,740
cloud version in a car version for

2210
02:16:29,969 --> 02:16:43,830
example I trust you I give you because

2211
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:48,689
trusting trust trusting in the cloud as

2212
02:16:43,830 --> 02:16:51,299
dangers but without because many

2213
02:16:48,689 --> 02:16:54,450
places scan your web remotely from the

2214
02:16:51,299 --> 02:16:56,340
outside it's wonderful when they see

2215
02:16:54,450 --> 02:17:00,750
something that's so wrong they don't

2216
02:16:56,340 --> 02:17:03,689
know how it's wrong so that option is

2217
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:05,250
wonderful yes maybe you can have a web

2218
02:17:03,689 --> 02:17:19,139
interface yeah I hadn't thought about

2219
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:22,410
that but that's a good idea for you you

2220
02:17:19,138 --> 02:17:25,740
do a plugin I can give you encrypted

2221
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:29,058
spyware you then access my website and

2222
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:31,500
you scan it subdirectory by subdirectory

2223
02:17:29,058 --> 02:17:34,410
yeah it seems like a very interesting

2224
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:38,549
idea thank you very much indeed for that

2225
02:17:34,410 --> 02:17:40,920
thank you thank you everybody we wrap up

2226
02:17:38,549 --> 02:17:43,858
the initial round of presentations

2227
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:47,040
that's now move over to the hackathon

2228
02:17:43,859 --> 02:17:49,939
area and let's start working on the

2229
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:49,939
project see you there

2230
02:17:56,558 --> 02:17:58,618
you
