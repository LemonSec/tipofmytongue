1
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:27,740
what it is good morning we're going to

2
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,750
begin this presentation on data

3
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:36,190
protection I hope you find this of

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:39,559
interest and before I begin I like to

5
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:42,440
explain what a data protection is about

6
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,589
some background information I also talk

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,370
about legislation enforce boolean we'll

8
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:52,280
talk about computers and I'll talk to

9
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,890
you about the data protection in general

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:59,300
data protection is a right that we all

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:03,199
have as individuals to decide on our own

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,840
personal data I'm not only referring to

13
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,289
the data that directly identify me like

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,450
my name picture surname ID number I'm

15
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:14,539
referring to all personal info

16
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,610
everything that can identify me as an

17
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:19,130
individual and this is a fundamental

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:23,660
right that is linked to my the right to

19
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:26,060
self-determination 50 years ago was easy

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:29,390
to decide on personal data because it

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,000
was written on a paper and it was you to

22
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:35,090
decide but now it's difficult because we

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,920
all leave traces digital traces on the

24
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,470
internet we all have credit cards we all

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,810
have mobile phones and we all have a

26
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:47,390
clinical record and the hospitals

27
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:50,599
provide treatment so it's impossible not

28
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,759
to leave a digital footprint of our

29
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:55,789
information have you ever stopped to

30
00:01:52,759 --> 00:02:00,289
think why some apps installed a year

31
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:02,780
mobile recommend you or ask you for a

32
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:06,110
station to be able to access your

33
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,789
battery profile or manage your use of

34
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,250
the battery have you ever thought about

35
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:14,239
that small details that's a way of

36
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:17,120
identifying someone AV you in the OS of

37
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,550
a mobile that it access your battery

38
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,099
you're allowing it to know whatever

39
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:26,260
you've got installed and the mobile and

40
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,260
which are the ones that consume

41
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:33,660
batteries and therefore which are the

42
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:36,150
wants to use most and that's a result it

43
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,570
will be able to do advertising or offer

44
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,670
that info to a third party on the apps

45
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:46,380
you have installed a for example you

46
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,660
have a sports app and you practice a

47
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,540
specific sport when you enter the social

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,130
media you will receive them advertising

49
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,019
because that everything you have in the

50
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,359
mobile has sold your data to a third

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,810
party in that third party is showing you

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,510
ads and that third party is making money

53
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,410
and as you access those websites you are

54
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,989
generating money and here is when the

55
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,900
Data Protection Act comes into place

56
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:15,420
where we need an act a regulation that

57
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,880
sets limits in order to ensure that

58
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,459
people can exercise fully their rights

59
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,150
and freedoms we currently have a

60
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:26,460
directive in an organic act for data

61
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,160
protection next year we will have a

62
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,640
European data protection regulation the

63
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:41,630
regulation basically will come into

64
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:44,459
force on May 25 2008 een we can have

65
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,100
additional regulation as Member States

66
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,650
of the EU according to the regulation we

67
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,799
can have a national regulation in order

68
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:57,240
to adapt the community regulation to our

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:04:00,570
Spanish legal framework for example the

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:04,740
Spanish legal framework needs to adapt

71
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,989
the community legislation because for

72
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,110
example here in Spain we have the

73
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:12,840
autonomous regions and we have some

74
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,520
specificities and this is the

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,858
fundamental right that needs to be

76
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,280
enshrined in our legislation as well we

77
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:24,270
need to regulate this ourselves not only

78
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:28,388
in EU regulation scope well it applies

79
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:32,258
to all goods and services

80
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:34,749
and anything that entails the control or

81
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:37,770
the analysis of people versatile people

82
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:42,460
I'm not refrain that people that are

83
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:46,210
citizens or officially I'm referring to

84
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,659
anyone on you community grounds the

85
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:53,378
principles of the previous directive are

86
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:56,229
implicit in this new regulation there

87
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:59,770
are almost no changes the only change at

88
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:02,949
a national level is that in terms of

89
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:07,270
principles we used to have what we call

90
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:09,610
chassid or implicit consent and this is

91
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:14,349
going to disappear we're going to move

92
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:17,139
towards a scheme or a system of explicit

93
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:20,199
consent what's the main novelty what's

94
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,819
new with this regulation it's not just a

95
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,830
matter of principles it's a matter of

96
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:27,339
compliance what's new has to do with

97
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:30,068
compliance the active responsibility or

98
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:35,139
accountability the principle of

99
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:37,960
accountability is news regarding this

100
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,729
regulation in the past you had to comply

101
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,789
but now you need to prove that you're

102
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:46,710
complying with this regulation so there

103
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:50,949
is an accountability side to it that's

104
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,779
new with this new regulation and you

105
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,669
need to demonstrate that you're doing

106
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,310
this proactively that you're reviewing

107
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,560
the measures you've put into place what

108
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,259
kind of measures well for example first

109
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,169
thing you need to do before the 25th of

110
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:09,610
May is to have a register if you're

111
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:11,500
designing apps or info or systems or

112
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,740
digital systems you need to consider

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,710
that they are data protective principles

114
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,870
that you need to apply from the design

115
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,029
stage what does this mean well that

116
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,169
before you design your system you need

117
00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:25,629
to think about how you're going to

118
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:28,240
process information if you haven't

119
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:29,040
considered that in that voll translate

120
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,190
and

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,900
you cost in the future so more than an

122
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,200
expense you should view this as an

123
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:42,870
investment we by the Spanish Agency have

124
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,789
been contacted with queries and for

125
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,410
example companies that sent date abroad

126
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,650
and we asked them have you thought about

127
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,210
where you're sending that info have you

128
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:53,370
considered and the fact that you're

129
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,750
internationally transferring data and

130
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,380
they say no we hadn't thought about that

131
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:01,620
but now they do with this new regulation

132
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,490
you need to be able to secure that

133
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:08,640
transfer and data protection by default

134
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,370
is very much related to the concept of

135
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,280
opt in or opt out it is the user who has

136
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:16,350
to decide whether he or she wants to be

137
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,989
part of a list that receives data it is

138
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:21,330
the user that also has the right to

139
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,570
decide whether he wants to opt out and

140
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,840
there's another novelty something else

141
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:30,450
that's new which has to do with impact

142
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,710
assessments so you're going to treat and

143
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:38,310
process data a you're going to process

144
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:41,789
personal data and perhaps we're talking

145
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,310
about a high or low risk data we are

146
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,530
unaware of that if they entail high risk

147
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,440
you will have to conduct necessarily an

148
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,369
in-person assessment ie an analysis

149
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,440
before processing this involves of

150
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,510
planning all these aspects are very much

151
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,840
related to what we call the risk

152
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:03,840
approach of the new community data

153
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,549
protection regulation if you haven't

154
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,640
done an impact assessment and you're

155
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,130
still telling on whether you should can

156
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,610
or cannot process data you will have to

157
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:17,400
contact a Data Protection Authority and

158
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,340
that authority will tell you if you can

159
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,900
do so or not and well specify the

160
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,419
measures you need to implement in order

161
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,489
to process data new acts of

162
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:30,870
responsibility or accountability up

163
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:34,500
until now in Spain security breaches had

164
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,750
to be notified by the telecom providers

165
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,610
according to the national telecom

166
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:42,179
provider Act

167
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:45,390
but now everybody it has this

168
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,260
responsibility of reporting and security

169
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:52,500
breaches to the Spanish Data Protection

170
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:54,150
Agency how can we prove this active

171
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,800
responsibility or accountability well

172
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,079
there are several mechanisms the Code of

173
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,630
Conduct

174
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,000
certification schemes these are also

175
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:07,370
mechanisms that helped us certify this

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,370
if I subscriber certification with ISO

177
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:21,300
17100 in terms of data protection 282 in

178
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:24,540
terms of security measures well what was

179
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,120
said previously by article 9 of the L

180
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,480
OPD you need to implement technical and

181
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,770
organizational measures as appropriate

182
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,990
face of this state of art and when well

183
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,120
this of course is a risk approach and

184
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,950
when the regulation talks about risk

185
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,360
approach it does so from two points of

186
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,950
view and the one hand we do have the

187
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,250
security measures and secondly you have

188
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:49,230
a risk in terms of the rights and duties

189
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,900
of individuals how should we interpret

190
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,660
this risk piece of either rights and

191
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,220
duties of individuals provides an

192
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,800
obligation let me give you an example

193
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:05,040
imagine that haven't analyzed my risk

194
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:08,969
appropriately I managed a health center

195
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:15,120
that processes a citizen's data and I

196
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:17,640
have reached security and I as a result

197
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,980
all the data from my patients are

198
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,960
accessible this would be an important

199
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,720
security breach because this would

200
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:28,770
affect these people not only directly

201
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,440
but also indirectly I said it would also

202
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,930
affect their health probably these

203
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,560
people would have greater difficulties

204
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:42,380
when hiring our

205
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,880
health insurance policy because the

206
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,090
insurance companies who won't view them

207
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,730
as practicable and will probably not one

208
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:53,100
to engage in a relationship with them

209
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,290
what could be the impact on these

210
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,080
people's lives would it be the same for

211
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:01,530
everybody won't probably none let's

212
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:05,460
imagine that if someone has AIDS for

213
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:09,750
example and is a 90 year old that person

214
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:13,170
probably doesn't mind about having that

215
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:17,940
info disseminated because he is no

216
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:21,839
longer working and but what happens if

217
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:25,770
we're talking about a child if that info

218
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,790
is disclosed perhaps he's discriminated

219
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:32,579
at school at university it could also

220
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:33,719
have negative impact in terms of his

221
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,170
employability

222
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,080
maybe he's unseen as profitable employee

223
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:43,020
because he requires a medical assistance

224
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,790
and this is what the regulation is

225
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,850
talking about when it talks about the

226
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:50,400
risk becoming the rights and duties of

227
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,440
individuals as for these security

228
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,990
measures and the activity registered

229
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,850
well first a description whenever it's

230
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,430
possible where possible but it's almost

231
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,890
always possible how am i compliant with

232
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,870
security measures if I'm a public

233
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,300
administration I will have to comply

234
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,780
with a national system if I'm a private

235
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,660
company maybe I have a company that I've

236
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:24,329
hired that is managing this according to

237
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:26,339
ISO 17025 a security document are you

238
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,230
all aware of the security document and

239
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:32,250
how it works there was an internal

240
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:35,990
document organization in-house document

241
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:39,950
that described the rights and duties of

242
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,480
employees profiles also a list of

243
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,220
profiles that had to be very much

244
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
detailed and you can have a link where

245
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,329
all this information

246
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,279
you don't have to explicit all the info

247
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:53,128
unit I need to make it public but you

248
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:55,350
can have a link and that grants you

249
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:57,389
access to this info and then I here

250
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,459
ensue the code of conduct or a

251
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:01,499
certification make it said this can be

252
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:05,699
part of your security measures and you

253
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:08,399
can adhere to a sectoral code of contact

254
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:10,290
and aside from demonstrating of my

255
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,360
productivity in the way of process data

256
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,748
it's a way of basically demonstrating

257
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,449
that I'm complying and that I have set

258
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:20,819
of security measures Julie in place

259
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:23,969
something that changes as well with this

260
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:26,939
new regulation and and that renders

261
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,869
managers more responsible and actively

262
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:33,988
responsible is the relationship between

263
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:38,100
the users and the managers and the due

264
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:40,139
diligence element was implicit in the

265
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,999
past now it's no longer the case not a

266
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,389
matter of hiring whoever you need to

267
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:48,449
regulate a series of things as you can

268
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:51,269
see on slide on the one hand we have a

269
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:56,998
known disclosure duty or confidentiality

270
00:13:51,269 --> 00:14:00,739
duty and article 12 of FL opt is also

271
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:06,600
enshrined here and now we have more

272
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:11,369
powers given to the person responsible

273
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:16,230
for example inspection you can go and

274
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:19,709
see what the person in charge is doing

275
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:24,709
as the person responsible I can do it

276
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:28,649
and I can do it with a service contract

277
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:33,299
in relation to this just to say that we

278
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:38,699
have published a manual or a guide with

279
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:42,749
the recommendations to guide contractual

280
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:48,868
clauses in this direction what are the

281
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:51,690
tasks for somebody that is responsible

282
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:55,080
to the compliance

283
00:14:51,690 --> 00:15:00,120
the regulation speaks about the model

284
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:04,350
contracts we don't have such a thing so

285
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:08,780
far we just have this manual or handbook

286
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:13,460
so we see the glosses we can add in this

287
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:15,829
service provision contract about

288
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:20,370
international transfers here their

289
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:23,790
regulation is more flexible than before

290
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:26,540
here in international transfers there is

291
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:30,839
more flexibility there are more new

292
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:33,300
mechanism so that you can carry out an

293
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:38,210
international transfer that can be

294
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:42,050
carried out by belt positions VCRs

295
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:45,180
contractual standard contract or clauses

296
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:49,650
approved by the Commission the

297
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,839
contractual glosses approved by national

298
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:55,079
level but also by the Commission and

299
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,000
codes of conduct and certification

300
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,860
schemes and the results of the

301
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:08,600
possibility of legitimate interest about

302
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:11,970
rights it pays a special importance to

303
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,810
transparency especially for underaged

304
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:18,120
any right when it affects an enriched it

305
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:24,839
has a greater impact in their life than

306
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:27,180
to an adult regulation ism takes into

307
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:30,150
account the situation and stresses the

308
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,370
principle of transparency and the

309
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:36,930
information that the minors should get

310
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:40,760
in relation to handling his or her data

311
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:45,239
it includes the right to forget fullness

312
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:49,800
in a regulated manner we know that this

313
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:53,010
right is the same as we call in the past

314
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:58,650
the right to opposition applied to

315
00:16:53,010 --> 00:17:01,970
browsers and his regulation also relates

316
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,970
to civil

317
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,460
responsibilities the right to indemnity

318
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:12,969
and responsibility when the handling of

319
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:15,190
data has been missed used what does it

320
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:19,089
mean for control authorities this

321
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:22,180
regulation a new supervision model is an

322
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:23,980
added complexity we should all agree now

323
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,130
are a European level how was the

324
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:32,140
coordination before in Brussels we had

325
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:34,150
the group work by article 29 all Data

326
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,110
Protection Authority national data

327
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,490
protection entities work together now we

328
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,889
will have the European Committee for

329
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,720
data protection was at the European

330
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:48,070
supervise study of a data protection

331
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:50,920
that would be the European one now a

332
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:55,889
claim can be presented through a single

333
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:58,750
shop in any of the countries to any

334
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:03,220
control authority and then we should see

335
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:06,760
who can is entitled to carry out this

336
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:10,270
research there will be a complex system

337
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:15,610
to regulate sanctions with the

338
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:18,910
sanctioning criteria about sanctions we

339
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:23,740
keep the same principles they should be

340
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:28,300
effective proportionate and deterrent

341
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:31,420
and as I said they should give the

342
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:36,129
possibility for penal sanctions or

343
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:38,200
criminal sanctions in Europe we have the

344
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:40,630
concept of administrative function which

345
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,290
is not the case in some countries in

346
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:47,190
Europe that we are in Turbo the pathways

347
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:51,460
when we refer to the possibility of

348
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:57,840
criminal sanctions this is our way if

349
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,840
you are obtaining some profits thanks to

350
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:08,900
sanction they can ask you to pay them

351
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:11,780
back let us see how this will finally be

352
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,610
realized the fines are very high I was

353
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,030
criticized because we got six hundred

354
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:22,490
thousand euros Pines but now they are

355
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:25,310
quite high we speak about 4% of company

356
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,500
what do we want by this those are not

357
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:30,860
defines do somebody that has a coffee

358
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,470
shop we're not going to sanction them as

359
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:36,469
much because we it will be the closing

360
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:39,560
of companies we will be against the

361
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:42,230
objectives of the regulation itself here

362
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:45,409
we're speaking about large companies the

363
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:48,560
idea is to avoid the profitability of

364
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,260
the infraction and there are companies

365
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:55,210
that in the profit and a second it was

366
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:58,220
more profitable to pay the fine to the

367
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,530
protection agency than to comply with

368
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:05,890
the treatment in or handling of

369
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:09,379
information here we see large companies

370
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:14,540
large Internet companies what do we have

371
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:16,840
all information from a new regulation we

372
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,580
have a specific site for this all

373
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,040
information published is in our website

374
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:27,889
here to the left there is a small

375
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:31,310
section and in May next year this small

376
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:35,830
section will be our website and we will

377
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:39,710
speak about the new regulation and that

378
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,909
all I wanted to say I'm now going to

379
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,910
give the floor to Julio

380
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,230
a little bit

381
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:12,690
it's

382
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:59,659
hello following on with Andres

383
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:06,620
presentation about the regulatory

384
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:09,529
framework I would like to focus and what

385
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:14,658
the agency do to raise the awareness of

386
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:17,740
underage when handling their personal

387
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:22,269
information especially in internet I

388
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,980
will only speak about the digital world

389
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:29,389
those are the principles that we all

390
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:35,600
know the possibilities and the risks for

391
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:40,969
our private life and something that if

392
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:44,658
you're a youngster you overcome time and

393
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:48,500
space limitations and information you

394
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:50,360
upload will be there forever and we want

395
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,380
to raise the awareness about this fact

396
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:58,189
in information we give in internet

397
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:06,139
personal data as Andrea said everything

398
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:08,389
that can identify you is one is used by

399
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:10,820
many because we have personal

400
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:13,639
information to give of course we have

401
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:17,840
the regulation why we should protect the

402
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:22,060
children i we all know the principle of

403
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:25,240
the highest interest to the minors but

404
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:29,690
the last reform about the legislation

405
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:32,360
stresses that the highest interest is

406
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:36,410
going to be taken to account for minors

407
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,590
and he has a prevalence against the rest

408
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:44,450
of in the interest of those that

409
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:50,149
surround them and training they are

410
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:54,770
considered as a vulnerable collectivity

411
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:58,120
and the exposure of the information that

412
00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:03,080
we give about them but that they give

413
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:06,620
and sometimes we say they have they are

414
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:11,870
more capable but those skills are

415
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:14,719
mechanical the fact of being reasonable

416
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:17,899
to think in a logical manner they have

417
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,360
to acquire them as in any training

418
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:24,680
process the famous concept of digital

419
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:28,729
natives is going to be considered

420
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:31,340
current code what we can do is if we

421
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:34,090
adults we don't train them we don't

422
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:37,399
accompany them they could end up being

423
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:41,870
digital orphans instead of digital

424
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,940
natives this is a chart of the National

425
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,020
Employment Institute about the use of

426
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,280
Internet

427
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:53,720
this is includes the whole spectrum not

428
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:56,480
only minors and if you see global

429
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,270
internet views between ten and fifteen

430
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,300
years we they use ninety five percent

431
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:06,680
those figures are repeatedly if you get

432
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:10,030
data from 2016 is slightly below but

433
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:14,180
it's almost universal the use of

434
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:17,120
Internet technology is universal in

435
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:20,120
minors and this is something that is

436
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,320
important the sociological research

437
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,629
center in one of their surveys asked

438
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,689
about

439
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,790
- and Internet access and how it should

440
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:34,720
be done and you see the results

441
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:37,450
85% should have a limited internet

442
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,390
access they are those that think that

443
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:43,720
they should have some limitations does

444
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:49,780
that be totally limited just a little

445
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:55,960
limited but if you see in 85% the idea

446
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:58,440
is to limit it or to raise awareness or

447
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,010
maybe this is impossible

448
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:06,670
in what are we doing in our agency we

449
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:10,000
have a strategic plan for four years

450
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:14,200
been a special emphasis in prevention

451
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,820
prevention tool and here we have an

452
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:23,320
action plan where - and education are

453
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:29,500
consider a priority the strategic plan

454
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:33,970
of course is uploaded in our website so

455
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:36,610
the idea is to give all to meet those

456
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:39,220
objectives to promote knowledge to the

457
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:44,020
right data protection and value of

458
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:47,320
privacy to educate in a responsible use

459
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,720
of information not only personal

460
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,260
information but also information from

461
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,750
third parties will very happily provide

462
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,870
our own information but sometimes we

463
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:02,170
give a third parties information whether

464
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:07,290
in pictures or in some other format

465
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,290
without asking for content

466
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:15,960
certain behaviors and we will see our

467
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:23,639
own offense our criminal

468
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:25,980
below 14th miners can not be subject to

469
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:29,240
a court case but the responsibilities go

470
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:35,070
for their parents and between 14 and 18

471
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:38,090
they've got the minor criminal law some

472
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:42,389
measures for those actions that are

473
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:47,570
crime as harassment or grooming are

474
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:52,080
crimes and they can give rise to some

475
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:57,059
criminal or civil responsibilities at

476
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:59,399
the end of the day we try to decrease as

477
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,830
much as possible and from the viewpoint

478
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:04,649
of personal information but it's

479
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,960
something that permeates in the rest of

480
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:11,508
the areas we try to reduce risk

481
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:15,409
situations so that they have a secure

482
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:19,080
use of internet and join its advantages

483
00:28:15,409 --> 00:28:22,350
in this strategic plan we have all those

484
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:29,720
actions and some more and I'm going to

485
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:33,689
stop mainly in the last two of the rest

486
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:38,279
in our agency to education authorities

487
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:41,669
we have proposed a Content planning to

488
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:46,429
develop in the curriculum all regional

489
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:50,129
governments have a curriculum where

490
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:53,850
information and ICTs are included in

491
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:56,100
Madrid they have a scene subject that is

492
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:58,350
robotics but they are not developed in

493
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,139
all regional governments this will be

494
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:04,110
part of a module that in this subject

495
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:05,998
might help to get to know about the

496
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:09,508
regulation and the awareness about the

497
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:12,539
subject and the agency has proposed this

498
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:16,799
so the idea is

499
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:20,529
that they should work in this direction

500
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:24,639
and now let us see the new teaching

501
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:26,229
materials the action of the agents in

502
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:30,070
addition to collaboration with other

503
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:32,799
administrations in creating teaching

504
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:36,939

506
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,479
we have redesigned a new website and I

507
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:45,579
invite you to visit it those that are

508
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:49,539

512
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:09,639
screens when people are at risk and

513
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:15,509
teaching materials guides where we teach

514
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:18,639
about the good use of Internet we have a

515
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:24,729
version for children and other for

516
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:28,059
parents and educators in this teach had

517
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:30,749
to read in Internet we speak about what

518
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:34,089
behaviors can be harassment or crime

519
00:30:30,749 --> 00:30:35,829
what are the consequences and the guide

520
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:39,450
that will teach them how to be legally

521
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:42,579
Internet we teach parents and educators

522
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:46,570
the regulations and what is the

523
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:54,820
consequence from a more serious

524
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:58,329
viewpoint all those are found in PDF

525
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:04,529
files so the idea is that they are known

526
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:06,908
and useful to all this is a publication

527
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:09,489
quite recent publication it was

528
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:12,219

529
00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:15,450

530
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:19,090

somebody else said this was not possible

538
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:49,020
but this is not the case but in some

539
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:53,500
school centers they ended up suspending

540
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:56,889

00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,328
they are heavier than the ones entitled

583
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,879
you control in Internet the target

584
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:45,929
audience is the families in this case

585
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:50,159
but they are also available and we also

586
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:52,849
have some awards that we call every year

587
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,099

00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:08,900
institutions that

592
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:17,629

about good internet practice in January

594
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:26,490
we will communicate the winners and in

595
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:30,870
2016 we had 17 education centers that

596
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:36,629
presented projects the winner was a

597
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:41,730
school from Salamanca and we had some

598
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:44,310
candidates to the individual that helped

599
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:48,300
the promotion and dissemination of good

600
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:52,920
practices because I don't have much time

601
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:57,740
I wanted to go back and speak about

602
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:02,640
something that is interesting the agency

603
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:07,379
started in September 2015 a

604
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:14,250
communication challenge channel that is

605
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:16,410
open for the handling of data by minors

606
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:20,630
or for minors because were not the

607
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:24,120
police were not well known especially

608
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:26,730
among the minors but parents and school

609
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:31,400
centers and health care centers and City

610
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:35,280
Council's and social services they asked

611
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:41,970
questions about the good or bad handling

612
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:45,720
of data for example at school I after

613
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:51,109
request content by all students but it's

614
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:55,290
just for an internet but if I say no

615
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:57,900
they say that I cannot take pictures so

616
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:59,640
what do we do in those situations those

617
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:04,200
are the type of queries or questions we

618
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:08,890
get and since its implementation we've

619
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:15,009
got around 13,000 queries and

620
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:19,129
and those are our channels to respond

621
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:21,530
the email address is the more advisable

622
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:30,980
but you also have a telephone line or

623
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:34,730
walk what shop and before giving you the

624
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:38,900
showing you the videos to say something

625
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:43,700
or just comment about the legislative

626
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:48,860
framework for minors the handling for

627
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:51,500
everyone we implement all the regulation

628
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,830
but it has some specificities for

629
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:59,240
example that give consent

630
00:37:53,830 --> 00:38:02,900
you should be above 14 below it has to

631
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:07,629
be your the parents or tutors in any

632
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:11,870
application any information society

633
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:14,540
service devoted to minors below 14

634
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:17,089
parents should give content and those

635
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:20,509
are asked for consent they should

636
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,700
correspond the burden of the proof of

637
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,700
that age and I know you're gonna say

638
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:29,689
that is complex and difficult the social

639
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:32,990
media juices have contests you introduce

640
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:35,420
your age and if you are above 14 they

641
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:38,540
just open it up but the residue

642
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:41,990
diligence duty in establishing mechanism

643
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:47,690
to check the H you should take into

644
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:52,600
account that minors we cannot get

645
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:55,760
information from miners families context

646
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:58,910
from economic situation or job of

647
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:03,620
difference you can ask data about your

648
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:07,930
parents so that the company may address

649
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,930
the parents pickles

650
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:16,490
I can ask permission to treat this

651
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,370
information because I am a tourist

652
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:23,930
producer or I offers services devoted to

653
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:26,509
minors information when is addressed to

654
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:29,419
minors the information about the

655
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:32,600
handling of information should be in an

656
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:35,090
accessible language appropriate to the

657
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:40,640
age range which is not always the case

658
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:44,890
it corresponds to the leaders to certify

659
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:48,740
those procedures that verify the age or

660
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:53,270
the parents consent and not the minor

661
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:55,279
pretendin is one of keys of her parents

662
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:59,509
and in relation to the European

663
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:04,850
Parliament consent should be given from

664
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:10,280
16 onwards but it also sets pay so that

665
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:13,940
member states can lower the range from

666
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,850
13 to 16 because this is an open process

667
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:20,420
under is a draft bill for data

668
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:22,700
protection this new bill is still in

669
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:30,530
progress but it has said that concerns

670
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:35,540
age for minors is 13 and this is equal

671
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:40,490
to the European scene and also us the

672
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:44,210
large social media Facebook the age

673
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:47,089
range in United States is 13 when they

674
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:53,060
arrived to Spain they had to adapt their

675
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:58,020
counters she made it up to 14 so now we

676
00:40:53,060 --> 00:41:03,240
are equal to Europe and do

677
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:12,560
u.s. social media and here I just wanted

678

to show you don't look tan

679
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:31,080
listen one of the four videos it lasts

680
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:32,069

what you see here is not a bicycle it's

684
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,038
a fit to run three one of the best BMX

685
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,960
bicycles in the market this is right his

686
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,710
owner he's 14 years old and his BMX

Rygel's riding everywhere in the morning

689
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:04,770
to go to secondary school after school

690
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:08,730

00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:12,240
weekend he writes to record videos for

692
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:15,930
his YouTube channel explaining his

693
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,750
tricks he rather goes on a bank than

694
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:21,839
doing anything else very often he just

695
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,000
interrupts any conversation to go riding

696
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,910
at night

697
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,240
he always takes his bike with him home

698
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:33,538
he's always with his bike for long he

699
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,700
hasn't been sitting in his chair but to

700
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:38,130
do his homework to have dinner a so we

701
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,589
think his bike when he showers he also

702
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:43,230
washes his bicycle and of course when he

703
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:47,460
goes to bed at night the bicycle goes to

704
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:50,940
bed with him yes I know what you're

705
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:53,549
thinking maybe Rai is exaggerating you

706
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,410
my enjoyed your bicycle but something

707
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:58,890
quite different it's not to be able to

708
00:42:55,410 --> 00:43:01,020
separate from it let us make an

709
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:04,379
experiment well if we change Ray's

710
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:06,538
bicycle by Internet do you think is an

711
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,809
exaggeration have you ever taken your

712
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:11,130
smartphone to bed haven't you ever watch

713
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:12,510
your tablet while you are doing your

714
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,910
homework or having dinner

715
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:17,720
you've never interrupted a conversation

716
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:21,210
or any other thing because you've got a

717
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:23,279
whatsapp message how long can you be

718
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:27,119
doing an activity without interrupting

719
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:30,299
it for whatsapp message or any other

720
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,609
thing Internet is not bad it's got many

721
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:36,000
good things is good to communicate with

722
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:39,058
friends family find new games watch

723
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,880
films read books find sites and

724
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:45,240
information and to sort out all sorts of

725
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:47,550
problems to buy to sell to teach and to

726
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:53,609
learn do you have internet

727
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:56,040
is really grand as having a Duke x3 bike

728
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:58,410
but if you spend your life in Internet

729
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,200
you will be missing many other things as

730
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:03,060
if you were always on your bike there's

731
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,669
something else the Internet is similar

732
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,770
to a bike if you misuse it you can have

733
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:10,800
disastrous consequences no matter how

734
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:13,500
good you are riding if you are on the

735
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,700
opposite lane without brakes you might

736
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:20,610
end up crashing to a car okay there are

737
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,560
not cars in Internet but have you ever

738
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:24,450
thought about your digital footprint

739
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,870
whenever you publish something in your

740
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:31,169
media you are live in footprint whether

741
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:35,730
a tweet Facebook post or picture in

742
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:38,640
Instagram this digital footprint is the

743
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:42,030
memory of what your activity in Internet

744
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,100
and I will go along all your life for

745
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:46,080
good and for bad imagine that tomorrow

746
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:49,259
you want to work in a company the first

747
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,330
thing they will do to decide whether

748
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,250
they will hire you or not is to look for

749
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:56,340
your name and in turn they will google

750
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:58,320
you they will look at your blog your

751
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,750
facebook comments your profiles

752
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:04,410
everything just previously published and

753
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:08,490
they will have a better or worst view

754
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:10,009
depending on your digital footprint so

755
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:14,040
she'll me they are not dangerous

756
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:16,470
bicycles are not dangerous if you drive

757
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,500
carefully that's why be fortune in

758
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:21,299
something in the media is good to think

759
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,080
about the impact it will have in the

760
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,550
digital footprint first league much

761
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:28,770
dismissed a player because they found

762
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:32,010
that they had insulted the team in

763
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:36,450
twitter he just uses it many years

764
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:39,060
before but they left trace so remember

765
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:41,580
when you publish in Internet stays and

766
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:44,000
your digital footprint will be with you

767
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:46,950
for long and it might have good or bad

768
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,990
consequences that depends on you keeper

769
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,720
reflexive attitude when you publish in

770
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:54,810
the media in the social media internet

771
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:57,600
and social media are great but there are

772
00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:00,450
more other great things in life

773
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,130
and you can enjoy them when you're not

774
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:10,020

handling of personal information and our

806
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:49,200

[Applause]

818
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:39,130
to see we have a question I think you

819
00:49:36,919 --> 00:49:43,279
for the information I work at a public

820
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:46,640
administration and I admit that I didn't

821
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:50,209
know much about this at work as a public

822
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:53,419
servant I found out a few days ago that

823
00:49:50,209 --> 00:49:56,899
there isn't any sanction against me for

824
00:49:53,419 --> 00:49:59,839
misuse of personal data

825
00:49:56,899 --> 00:50:04,279
I've been used working as if it was the

826
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:08,869
case just due to my ethics but does the

827
00:50:04,279 --> 00:50:10,939
new regulation include sanctions that is

828
00:50:08,869 --> 00:50:13,399
not just an evaluation that states

829
00:50:10,939 --> 00:50:15,469
you're bad employee if you work in the

830
00:50:13,399 --> 00:50:18,399
public administration you have the same

831
00:50:15,469 --> 00:50:22,309
problem the agency can sanction you as

832
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:26,828
civil servant by an infringement is not

833
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:30,049
always economical but is an infringement

834
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:35,059
whether to you or to the entity you work

835
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:38,959
for but as you can be fined either

836
00:50:35,059 --> 00:50:44,899
economically or disciplinary or you can

837
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:48,709
have a criminal sanction sorry we didn't

838
00:50:44,899 --> 00:50:50,888
get the comment she's not using the

839
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:54,399
microphone so we cannot translate this

840
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:54,399
lady's comments

841
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:14,900
okay no I myself you're economical and

842
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:18,618
paralyzing there's no economic fine for

843
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:23,630
public administrations but I saw it as

844
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:26,750
an admonishment well it goes beyond that

845
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:31,930
it can be an admonishment or they can

846
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:37,220
open let's say a complaint against you

847
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:41,140
well this bill is still a bill but when

848
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:46,490
the bridge is perpetrated by a public

849
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:49,009
administration there's a possibility of

850
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:51,919
initiating disciplinary proceedings

851
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:56,059
against that person this is something

852
00:51:51,920 --> 00:52:01,309
new and the new bill is still being

853
00:51:56,059 --> 00:52:07,450
discussed so ever proof is not only

854
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:07,450
making that let's a punishment public

855
00:52:09,339 --> 00:52:16,990
not only then there's also the

856
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:20,450
possibility of having the administration

857
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:23,450
start disciplinary proceedings against

858
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:26,839
the perpetrator but this is part of a

859
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:33,379
bill I just found out three days ago

860
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:37,609
that there was there was no economic

861
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:41,359
fine I can of course adhere to

862
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:43,940
professional secrecy but I was working

863
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:48,500
with the idea that the data with which I

864
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:51,859
handle and I work with women that are

865
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:54,019
victim of domestic abuse and I always

866
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:57,109
insisted don't leave any documents on

867
00:52:54,019 --> 00:53:01,038
the table you do very well you do very

868
00:52:57,109 --> 00:53:04,160
well because one of the sanctions are

869
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:07,029
punishments that we had to issue against

870
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:11,430
the civil servant but precisely because

871
00:53:07,029 --> 00:53:15,180
this lack of professional secrecy so we

872
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:17,970
I should a penalty to the administration

873
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:21,720
and to the per worker disciplinary

874
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:32,180
proceedings or sorta against the

875
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:33,439
employee I have a couple of questions

876
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:36,569
[Music]

877
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:40,289
the implementation of the general

878
00:53:36,569 --> 00:53:44,599
European regulation will it replace the

879
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:49,799
Spanish law the LPD or will both coexist

880
00:53:44,599 --> 00:53:53,099
well it will depend now it's at a bail

881
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:57,990
stage on the 25th of May we will be

882
00:53:53,099 --> 00:54:01,470
talking about an act and there will be

883
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:05,490
perhaps a full or partial tear or Gatien

884
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:11,788
so on the 25th of May our current ello

885
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:13,828
PD will disappear but the regulation is

886
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:18,750
community regulation has already been

887
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:23,190
approved why are we losing time and

888
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:27,240
doing a new L OPD if it's going to

889
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:34,579
extinguish or terminate on May the 25th

890
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:38,970
well the current framework is applicable

891
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:42,510
and basically what happens now is that

892
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:45,000
our ll PD cannot have any terms or

893
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:47,750
articles that contravene the community

894
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,750
regulations

895
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:53,980
European regulations can be directly

896
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,640
implemented they don't need to be

897
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:00,040
incorporated in the internal framework

898
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,920
but this one is a bit special because it

899
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:06,670
led some leeway to states for example

900
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:10,620
the ages of minors between 13 and 16

901
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:14,380
years of age so you can decide the age

902
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:18,609
group and with a new act what we want to

903
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:21,250
do is complete or cover those aspects

904
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:24,720
that are not governed by the regulation

905
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:27,670
because the act can never regulate or

906
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:30,930
against the European regulation

907
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:33,580
I know if you check the text or the bill

908
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:36,879
for the first time we're talking about

909
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:41,009
the possibility of accessing to data of

910
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:44,800
people that have passed away and

911
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:51,070
normally the loped didn't apply to the

912
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:53,140
disease but inheritors can now access to

913
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:58,200
the suppression of data regarding to

914
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:58,200
teach people this is something new for

915
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:06,280
example the new loped covers video

916
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:11,140
surveillance this is uncovered by

917
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,140
Europeana regulation also

918
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:19,520
representatives of companies but what

919
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,400
the new actors has to cover those

920
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:25,940
aspects that are not covered by the

921
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,940
community regulation and as I was saying

922
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:32,210
you do have some leeway as happens with

923
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:36,080
directives and there's the typical

924
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:38,720
example of minors the bill has talked

925
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:41,830
about thirteen year olds but states will

926
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,830
have the final say

927
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,100
you
