1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:24,840
empathize those good afternoon ladies

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:30,660
and gentlemen my name is but don't open

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:38,820
it and I'm here to make a presentation

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:44,040
on computing and forensics

5
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:48,930
the idea is to motivate youngsters and

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:53,250
I'm going to address for a sec computing

7
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:57,360
with very basic basic concepts so that

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:01,489
people understand what this is about I'm

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,289
not going to talk about applications and

10
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:07,490
when we finish them I'll be available

11
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:14,729
for whatever questions you may have so

12
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:19,530
let's compare between okto see done by

13
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:21,840
an anatomic forensic and an autopsy done

14
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:29,070
by a computer so that you understand

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:31,439
what forensic computer technicians do my

16
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,928
name is her know Paris I come from

17
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:40,609
figure days and the province of G don't

18
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:44,850
know to the east you probably know Navi

19
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:48,119
click of mine from my same area daddy

20
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,899
the painter comes from my town in this

21
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:55,740
image that you can see well of course

22
00:01:51,899 --> 00:02:02,399
this is the tomb of two very famous

23
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:06,208
people from figitus daddy and they've

24
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,380
been tutor who invented this have

25
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:12,530
another traditional Catalan tense

26
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:20,150
we also have the inventor of the

27
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:24,080
submarine bird here and one day one

28
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:29,060
night sorry the cemetery split with

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:33,970
hundreds of candles and there is a

30
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:39,490
guided visit around this cemetery and

31
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:44,930
it's quite interesting I myself like to

32
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:47,330
participate in this ritual I'm going to

33
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,270
talk about computing forensics and I

34
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,330
love to light up things with candles and

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,390
you then I'll explain to you why I like

36
00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:01,760
to lit things with candles for example

37
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:03,649
the cathedral in Britta pose with except

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,859
wait fifteen thousand candles do you

39
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:10,040
live huh candles at home yes no is there

40
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,200
something that you like fifteen thousand

41
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,470
candles don't you have questions with it

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,760
when talking about fifty thousand

43
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,760
candles how do you lit them

44
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:31,210
I don't only lit monuments I also make

45
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:34,480
Bruins and the ground huge large scale

46
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:38,710
drawings 40 meter drawings here you have

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,829
some examples I have received the

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,590
Guinness record for living of candles I

49
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,960
received it in December after hanging

50
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,330
with 80 to a thousand candles and do you

51
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,720
know how these candles are placed well

52
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:55,900
one by one do you know how we put them

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,020
one by one as well and how we turn a

54
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:02,380
month we blow them off one by one and

55
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:06,280
how do we collect them well with

56
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:11,049
terrible back pain as you can imagine

57
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:14,950
what by one why am I talking about

58
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:19,959
candles well because it's very important

59
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:22,719
to talk about a muddy candle in the

60
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,910
middle of a town serves no purpose

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,070
doesn't like much but when you've got

62
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,730
clear ideas and you know what do you

63
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:35,680
have to do the group of candles can help

64
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:37,720
you and do amazing amazing creations

65
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,270
when you're going to do a forensic

66
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,040
autopsy of a set of files

67
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,460
how many Falls are you going to work

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,200
with or client 200 thousand 1 million 2

69
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,659
million do you know how you're going to

70
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:54,010
analyze them one by one

71
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:56,250
yes no no where I teach technicians we

72
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,700
have the tools we need

73
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,710
not to do so and that's the difference

74
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:05,460
but it's very important that we

75
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:09,770
understand that files even the smallest

76
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,900
miles can provide us with the most

77
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:16,590
important evidence

78
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:19,919
that's why well this is one of my

79
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:24,119
hobbies and it's a good metaphor to

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:28,050
explain that your goal will not be read

81
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,000
um overnight but little by little what

82
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,490
matters is that you focus little by

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,380
little sometimes you find yourself

84
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:41,280
working with cases that are very complex

85
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,700
and think about Kendall's about this

86
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,010
idea of adding one by one and now doubly

87
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,060
so four characters one is very important

88
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:53,940
which is the forensic conductor and we

89
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,560
run around the cemetery and I'll share

90
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,990
with you an anecdote if we have time

91
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:04,980
this person this man explains the

92
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,350
medical aspect ie how people have died

93
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,860
during busy night tour

94
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:14,910
his name is Narcisse motherland he was

95
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,130
the director of the forensic Institute

96
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,729
in Spain he is well known

97
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:24,870
internationally I don't know you

98
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,940
remember the terrible tsunami and Asia

99
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,850
he was the coordinator of the

100
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:34,050
international team so he's arena and

101
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:35,070
professional and he's a close friend he

102
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:40,110
comes from the state

103
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:44,430
town as me he also loved as candlelit as

104
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,680
hobby and drink this night tour someone

105
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,800
said that we had to forensics during the

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,220
autopsy room and people know what

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:57,290
medical forensic doctors are but nobody

108
00:06:53,220 --> 00:07:00,480
is familiar with computer forensics and

109
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:04,800
my friend was even surprised by what I

110
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:07,080
was doing and I asked him a favor

111
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,510
he was that forensic doctor what do you

112
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,640
do an opto see him please to a computer

113
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:19,320
and my colleague said I am have very

114
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:22,200
basic knowledge on technology we is the

115
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,000
turn on bottom and rather turn up and I

116
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,300
told him no don't worry we're going to

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,840
use the protocol of on autopsy of

118
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,630
medical autopsy this presentation is a

119
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,630
presentation that I make in schools and

120
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:42,150
schoolers are often very much surprised

121
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,980
by what I say because it's true that

122
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,429
many of them are familiar with the idea

123
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:52,010
of I'm friends 6 thanks to TV shows like

124
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:56,550
CSI 20 years ago this was different

125
00:07:52,010 --> 00:08:00,870
and because these TV shows that it

126
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:04,050
existed but now thanks to she is high

127
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:09,420
for example well kids are familiar with

128
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:12,000
these terms with these concepts and then

129
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:17,370
we tell you what we did my friend and I

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,580
we met one day with a group of students

131
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,650
and I gave my colleague a computer which

132
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,140
is the one you can see here and this

133
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:29,370
laptop otherwise I left him that I found

134
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:31,200
in in a container garbage container I

135
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,820
don't know if you have ever found

136
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:39,179
garbage containers if you want to

137
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,580
exercise your computer forensics skills

138
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,098
you can go to garbage container and

139
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,440
start tinkering with it and you'll

140
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,750
probably be amazed by the amount of data

141
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:54,089
you can extract people are very unaware

142
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:57,600
about the need to protect age we talk

143
00:08:54,089 --> 00:09:02,250
about data protection but if you go to

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,190
whatever market or secondhand market you

145
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,089
will be able to purchase some equipment

146
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:15,080
with personal datum that's a computer

147
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:17,910
forensic I see the quickl in the forum

148
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,649
employees that are made republic to

149
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:27,870
contact you I mean an expert like myself

150
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:31,860
to be able to recover data from a laptop

151
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:36,029
or from a smartphone sometimes companies

152
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:39,120
contact computer forensics experts for

153
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:41,520
data recovery because perhaps the

154
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,430
employee has taken with him a smartphone

155
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:50,810
and when you recover data you're

156
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:56,160
recovering also backups from iCloud also

157
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:58,199
pictures personal pictures and people

158
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,660
need to understand that when they leave

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,000
their workplace if they're fired or

160
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:07,230
whatever they need to request a

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,750
certificate for data destruction anti

162
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,660
Forensic Services we have forensic

163
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:16,920
services but we also have anti Forensic

164
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:19,469
Services and so when you return your

165
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,930
mobile device where you're left up to

166
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,600
the company with this certificate you

167
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:27,569
know you then they're not going to

168
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,420
retrieve your personal data and then

169
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,880
City Council's this

170
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,839
also an issue and there will soon be

171
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,050
political changes and it's amazing how

172
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:41,360
the new originally the new newly

173
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,780
appointed regional ministers received

174
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,470
from the IT technician Sin City castles

175
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:51,280
left selves and a smartphone with

176
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:57,530
personal data from the previous person

177
00:10:51,280 --> 00:11:02,030
and for the forensic computer forensic

178
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:04,390
computing expert is that well of course

179
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:09,020
he will have to detect whether there's a

180
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:11,120
date already contained so this is Sosua

181
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,030
saying a laptop that I found in a

182
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,760
garbage container and I told my medical

183
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:19,400
colleagues let's do an autopsy so I put

184
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,740
it on the table and I said let's begin

185
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,579
and he said I don't know where I should

186
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,890
start

187
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,740
and I told him well I marches and this

188
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:29,930
is a corpse of dead body what would be

189
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,250
the first thing you do what's the first

190
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,819
thing you need to do with a course do

191
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:38,810
you know no first thing you need to do

192
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:42,530
and students are really fun well I take

193
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:46,189
a look at here and take a look at what's

194
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:49,449
inside know what you had to do this

195
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:52,250
first protect yourself protect yourself

196
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,680
why because by protecting yourself

197
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,540
you're protecting the evidence and he

198
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,189
told me the first thing I need to do is

199
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,300
to protect myself to put on my gloves

200
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:06,580
also my lab coat

201
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:09,280
my head my mask and I said just like my

202
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:12,760
salary she was startled he was surprised

203
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,829
I always used to glow so when I need to

204
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,110
manipulate keyboards that are not my

205
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,810
keyboard I always wear gloves for a

206
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,710
reason you know that keyboards have more

207
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:27,189
bacteria than a toilet seat and if you

208
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:29,290
turn one round and shake it yeah you

209
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:33,900
probably see that there's a bunch of

210
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:39,099
dirt there and the masks you know that

211
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:42,900
nap stops have ventilators and there's

212
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:46,810
much dust and dirt accumulated and

213
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,050
nothing goes inside my lab without going

214
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,969
through the compressor I myself don't

215
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,290
breathe that air I wear a mask and you

216
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,720
always need to wear gloves because

217
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:59,680
sometimes you need to extract a hard

218
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:03,730
drive or cloners right and the node tree

219
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,719
is there with you in order to certify

220
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,830
the process because you need to make

221
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,720
sure that the evidence is protected and

222
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:16,240
the no.3 is controlling that everything

223
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:19,150
is done as required and then the left

224
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,750
cow what toy were on that code for two

225
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,819
reasons first to access to my glasses

226
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,310
and second because it's almost like a

227
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:31,060
click a commutation to know that I'm in

228
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:33,819
working mode throughout of my career as

229
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,880
a computer forensics I've made big

230
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,529
mistakes big mistakes

231
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,720
in times I've even destroyed evidence

232
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,970
because I was in a hurry os under much

233
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,899
pressure for whatever reason I've made

234
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,490
mistakes and of course I'll help me you

235
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,750
know understand that I'm we're in

236
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,949
working mode and help me be more and

237
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:01,110
concentrated on what I do you can

238
00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:05,740
destroy a piece of evidence that is

239
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:11,050
essential vital and that can lead to

240
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:13,690
perhaps not arresting the perpetrator so

241
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,660
we need to be protected and as I was

242
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,930
saying earlier there are many

243
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:23,500
similarities between medical forensics

244
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:25,060
and computing forensics you may be

245
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,339
surprised by this and I should my

246
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:33,910
colleague this picture this is a guy

247
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:38,649
that has manufactured his own vacuum

248
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:40,509
hood and he's assembling a harddrive he

249
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:43,540
uses gloves as you can see I also

250
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:46,120
explain my colleague there there are

251
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:50,110
many many many similarities take a look

252
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,230
at this it's light and on this line we

253
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:58,630
can see how the incubator is very

254
00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:03,399
similar to the clean working station or

255
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:08,189
the headers of distres are disassembled

256
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:12,850
in the world of medicine there's a great

257
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:14,529
number of similarities on the one hand

258
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,779
we have the GPS the General

259
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:20,860
Practitioners that help you with general

260
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:24,029
minor health issues and then they refer

261
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,029
you to

262
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,269
specialist and then we have people in an

263
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,240
upper level the researchers that are

264
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:39,560
doing research to produce new drugs that

265
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:44,170
will perhaps save our lives and they're

266
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:47,869
the same level as hackers and we need to

267
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:52,160
of course respect them pay due respect

268
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:54,910
to hackers because sometimes they give

269
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,339
us a pill and they tell us this will

270
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,250
help you heal but how many clinical

271
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:04,730
trials have had to be done to approve

272
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,540
that drug that medicine and the world of

273
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:10,070
cybersecurity

274
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,800
this has to be explained as well you

275
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:16,730
need to explain the entire process

276
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:19,609
computer forensic professionals need to

277
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,860
be very very organized not everybody can

278
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,050
be an expert in computer for areas it's

279
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,079
not just about having basic knowledge

280
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:30,410
there it's also about attitude about the

281
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:32,510
mindset who can and who can't if you

282
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,969
take a look at the communications rack

283
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,890
you can tell sometimes you have people

284
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,690
that comes from the Systems

285
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:42,230
Administrator and if you see that his

286
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,570
system has all the assets of distant

287
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,300
listening he knows somewhat of the IP

288
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:50,410
sir everything is well documented the

289
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:55,069
cables are well laid out so that

290
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:58,930
everyone can know how the system is said

291
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:02,420
well this people this person can be a

292
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:05,299
computer forensic but this other profile

293
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:09,079
person that uses postage that is a bit

294
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:10,549
lost can't when you touch a piece of

295
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,520
evidence and then you need to go to

296
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:16,180
court you need to demonstrate or prove

297
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,490
that the steps you take

298
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:23,410
should another person do exactly the

299
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:26,079
same the same result should be obtained

300
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,970
exactly the same that's why it's very

301
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,280
important that we talk about attitude

302
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,160
computer forensics and rail organised

303
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,889
very much so and they need to be very

304
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,990
very patient always this is one of the

305
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:45,250
most distinctive features um once we are

306
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:48,420
protected we have our autopsy what's the

307
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,830
next step the next step would be

308
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,380
documenting as much as possible the

309
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:59,639
evidence collected with pictures with

310
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:03,190
videos etc and this is something that

311
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,580
forensic doctors and forensic computer

312
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,830
technicians share so it's a matter of

313
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,500
collecting as much as you can in our

314
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,030
smartphones we have a wonderful cameras

315
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,300
you need to picture absolutely

316
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,100
everything serial numbers whatever

317
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,860
everything I was one of the first who

318
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,610
had to set up a forensic computing lab

319
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:28,149
in order not to break the chain of

320
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:30,429
custody when you receive a phone it's

321
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,620
recognized by the notary and how can I

322
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:36,640
demonstrate that I'm not manipulating

323
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:40,449
this Mart phone well in the lab I said

324
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:44,920
about an equipment made up of 12 video

325
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:48,880
cameras there's no dead angle everything

326
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:51,460
is recorded around the clock 24/7 since

327
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,520
that time I bring the precinct till the

328
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:57,990
moment I place that seal once again

329
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,540
everything's really recorded and

330
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:03,640
sometimes it's 2 hours or three hours

331
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,860
everything is duly recorded delete

332
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,100
document

333
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,299
what else can I say recording

334
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,760
documentation let me give you a piece of

335
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:14,070
advice you need to work on a real-time

336
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,379
basis not a matter of saying today I'm

337
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,049
going to extract and then too much time

338
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,020
I'll check it out and I'll draft the

339
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:24,090
report now it doesn't work like that

340
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:27,270
memory fails and the older you are the

341
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,850
more it will fail so this is a good

342
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,950
piece of advice to you as I was saying

343
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:35,250
we need to document everything we

344
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:38,160
perhaps I've done 5,000 pictures the

345
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:42,450
next step of the autopsy will be to

346
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:47,549
examine the body from the outside and

347
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:50,580
and students say yes we're going to look

348
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:53,340
for bruises for scratches these are the

349
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:56,580
signals that you need to look for asides

350
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,209
from bruises and scratches well tattoos

351
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:04,379
for example and you know if this person

352
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:08,280
used to be a military biker or whatever

353
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:10,620
in an autopsy in an IT autopsy what are

354
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,418
you looking for most likely the same

355
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:18,559
you're looking for Mark's you were

356
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:21,690
looking for code barkos email numbers

357
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,360
serial numbers and this doctor that I

358
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:30,120
showed in the picture isn't a weary

359
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:35,699
person that bended had in the lower part

360
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:39,000
the Wi-Fi code the keep or the password

361
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:42,890
and the name of the Wi-Fi but you know

362
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:48,570
that with this information we're able to

363
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:52,620
well get a bit closer to accessing that

364
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:54,620
data once this examination has been

365
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,540
conducted and everything is totally

366
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:02,550
documented and we've registered all of

367
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:04,379
these marks and coats we need to take

368
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:07,320
care with it we need to open up the

369
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,180
carcass and he was telling me that the

370
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,750
first thing you need to do is to prepare

371
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:17,160
your tools your instruments and that's

372
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:22,410
what we do as well and as for the tools

373
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:25,260
that I recommend you I recommend you to

374
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:28,590
have the typical tools you would use to

375
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:32,460
disassemble Falls because some laptops

376
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:34,860
have are becoming more and more

377
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:37,350
sophisticated let me explain to you how

378
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,959
we work on a daily basis in a forensic

379
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:43,050
lab if for example you need to extract a

380
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,020
disk drive to corn it in front of a nut

381
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:50,909
tree but you will never ever do is go

382
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:53,730
there with a laptop and try to open it

383
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:56,820
drink for hours and then extract the

384
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:58,410
drive in the clone it no that's not how

385
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,189
it's done what are the best practices

386
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:04,950
well basically you get this depth told

387
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:08,070
you and I said well you observe it and

388
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:11,280
you do your tests at home in your office

389
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:17,159
so that when you have to go do this in

390
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:19,980
front of an uh tree you can be effective

391
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,170
and agile manner

392
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,260
we as computer forensics how do we

393
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,270
collect evidence we're not law

394
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,250
enforcement agencies those of us that

395
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:32,100
are independent forensic computer

396
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:36,180
technicians don't see is the evidence

397
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,820
the evidence is giving to us it's giving

398
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,520
to us by the customer by the interested

399
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,879
party steps that you need to follow

400
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,430
seven number one whenever you speak with

401
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,010
the customer hi how are you before he

402
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,160
explains anything you need to ask him

403
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,070
for the name

404
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,730
your name address and the first thing

405
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:59,409
you do is fill up comfort is healthy or

406
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,880
non-disclosure agreement so that

407
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,950
everything that this person thinks may

408
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,700
see you is duly protected and covered

409
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:10,030
this gives great

410
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,560
well inspires trust in the customer and

411
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,810
then little by little you need to

412
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,419
prepare your budget considering of the

413
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:21,010
background my customer is explaining to

414
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:23,410
me this or that what did I advise him or

415
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,870
her to do it this is worth X money you

416
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:29,440
prepare your coach your budget and if

417
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:35,429
the customer accepts the quote well he

418
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:38,710
will have to pay 50% in advance so 50%

419
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:42,730
money upfront before I started working

420
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:45,220
in that person then accepts the

421
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,790
observation what's most important is

422
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:51,960
that you need to have the consent

423
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:56,590
documents or authorization documents

424
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:00,520
because this person is demonstrating

425
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:04,959
that it is his his document a or his

426
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:08,230
equipment and is giving you the power to

427
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,450
access his social media his piece of

428
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:12,670
equipment if you don't have his or her

429
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,360
consent if you don't have his or her

430
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:18,670
authorization you won't be able to touch

431
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:22,570
absolutely anything otherwise you can be

432
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:26,920
in deep trouble I remember that I was

433
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:30,010
working once in a case with dead people

434
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:33,280
and that was a number of years ago and

435
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:36,580
people will pass away and Facebook

436
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,550
profiles were like they're up in the air

437
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,500
looming on the horizon

438
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:45,790
and what we see is that there are car

439
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,730
accidents every day and maybe the person

440
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:51,340
that passed away in a car accident has

441
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,740
an info that is very important for a

442
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,620
company that happened to me once I

443
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,010
remember this Widow

444
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:02,100
who asked me please to meet one day she

445
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:04,350
was going to bring me her husband's late

446
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:10,770
husband's computer so that I would

447
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:12,840
extract data so we met and she gave me a

448
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:16,430
laptop I had to extract all the

449
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,889
documents and they left I belonged to

450
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:22,500
her husband when our very renowned

451
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:27,090
lawyer in Barcelona and this lady

452
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:29,670
suspected that he was unloyal to her but

453
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,790
imagine that I extract everything I give

454
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:38,900
it to her I probably wouldn't be here

455
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:40,200
today I would have had great trouble so

456
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:43,830
true

457
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,460
sometimes we work you know and I'm in a

458
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:51,659
very difficult position and we in

459
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:53,190
Catalonia are used to living near the

460
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,080
border so don't you have the feeling

461
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,480
that you have one foot in from friends

462
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,550
another one in Spain and that's computer

463
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,070
forensics sometimes you have the feeling

464
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,678
that you're like on the boundary but

465
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,928
there is a limit and my advice to you is

466
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:11,190
to make sure that you don't exceed that

467
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:13,410
limit and because when you go to a

468
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,950
hearing a court hearing and when you

469
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:19,320
have to defend your report and this

470
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,640
could mess you up it's very important

471
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,290
that you know where the limits are

472
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:29,640
another piece of advice even good so

473
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:32,940
we're going to open the laptop the smart

474
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,200
phone you need to do this first in your

475
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:39,990
office or at home we have the tools I

476
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:43,350
need to double click and you get the top

477
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,150
and I you see this man wasn't listening

478
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:47,879
and I said what do you see and say let

479
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:51,390
us think you this is the corpse and I

480
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,950
made a important mistake there I thought

481
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,500
I was too smart that's why it's

482
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:59,070
important to be humble if you're going

483
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,850
to work in new technologies in computer

484
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,280
science

485
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:09,060
there are not expert things change so

486
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:12,000
fast and experts no longer exist them so

487
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:15,800
you always have to be humble and just

488
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,510
some advice you have to learn to forget

489
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,750
because today you're working with some

490
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:25,110
tools that make you feel comfortable but

491
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:29,090
after an update everything changed so

492
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:34,020
what you did before is no longer useful

493
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:38,179
so you have to adapt yourself you don't

494
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:42,540
have to link on the past and as I said I

495
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:47,040
was a smartass and I said dr. Narcisse I

496
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:51,030
know that for forensic when you open up

497
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:55,010
a corpse the said technique they draw a

498
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:58,110
Y letter in your body so you can extract

499
00:27:55,010 --> 00:28:02,190
the different body organs and the same

500
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:05,100
about the head when they open up and he

501
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,740
said no that's helpful and I use a

502
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:12,750
strudels technique and he explained to

503
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:19,500
me that he cuts from the hip up and arm

504
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:21,840
then opens you up so in order to extract

505
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,080
the body organs and that's when you

506
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,260
remember your mother telling you or

507
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:31,110
telling me to shut up and I was Adam I

508
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:35,430
realized I was not going to say anything

509
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:38,370
so we have our computer on dr. Luke's

510
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:41,100
and I asked him what you see and he said

511
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:44,189
I don't know and think that they are

512
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:52,439
body parts the most important is the

513
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:54,930
heart desk here we have all the parts

514
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:57,630
that we're going to examine and I

515
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,920
explained to him that the first thing to

516
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:04,020
be done is to balloon

517
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:06,460
the evidence he said how do you cloned

518
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:10,990
just have to imagine that they have a

519
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:15,929
corpse and with a printer a 3d printer I

520
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:19,570
do Michael Kors and you work on the copy

521
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:22,980
but the original judges keep it in the

522
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:26,980
freezer and this is cloning

523
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:35,380
so there we spoke about the difference

524
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:38,770
of with a living patel

525
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:42,700
or not and he said of course not he's

526
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:51,580
always with dead horses but we've have

527
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:55,110
to do this examination with real or

528
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:58,360
living computers but you have to think

529
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:03,729
that maybe we have to carry out an

530
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:07,719
autopsy or data extraction of a CPT when

531
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:13,090
you get into a CP Dean how do you do it

532
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:15,669
how do you manage well is as you get

533
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:19,030
into a whale and you start extracting

534
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:23,140
things we have this clone hard disk

535
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:27,000
drive and you are going to extract

536
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:29,530
things and I give him the following

537
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,330
similarities of the body parts were

538
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:36,330
going to get we can examine the hearin

539
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:50,129
here you can get much information over

540
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:54,470
the years the years in this case can be

541
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:58,950
and as you know we have some commands

542
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:02,600
that are the connected Wi-Fi through

543
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:08,460
public or semi-public networks you can

544
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:13,740
geo localized those Wi-Fi network 30

545
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:17,760
evidence is geo localized in a person of

546
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:24,500
this I will not speak of a real case it

547
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:28,260
was a disabled person with hearing

548
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:33,450
impairment and he couldn't communicate

549
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:37,500
with his daughter the father was and in

550
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,960
emails and whatsapp's via Skype they

551
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:44,039
spoke with sign language and he

552
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,590
presented this evidence to prove that in

553
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,220
fact he had a free communication with

554
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,899
her daughter sometimes we speak about

555
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:55,679
technological crimes and there seemed to

556
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:59,908
be just a few those that are in the law

557
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:04,380
but forensic might participate whenever

558
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:07,710
there is a device number what here were

559
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:10,760
speaking about custody obviously we

560
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:12,960
could read that all those emails were

561
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:17,279
the case and that there was

562
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:21,210
communication and it was good something

563
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:25,049
I was related to forensic is that they

564
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:30,029
have to ratify your report in front of

565
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:32,519
the judge here we have to be really

566
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:35,259
technical the

567
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:37,960
specificity of Efrain circus that they

568
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:40,539
have to know a lot about many different

569
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,909
subjects good forensics are those that

570
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:47,889
have a long experience are the things in

571
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:50,169
life that require experience they should

572
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:54,389
come from the world of programming so

573
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:57,309
that they have really high knowledge of

574
00:32:54,389 --> 00:33:00,490
always at least they should know how

575
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:04,119
file system worked you know that in our

576
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:07,389
profession we see that many there are

577
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:11,439
many intruders and you should have at

578
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:15,729
least you should have formal education

579
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,799
at least you have to be an IT expert

580
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:21,220
some people do not even know what a

581
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:25,299
metadata is or a file extension and this

582
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:28,720
happens in our code when discussing with

583
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:32,168
the other party in addition to always I

584
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,629
believe it's important to come out have

585
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:38,830
knowledge about the world of systems to

586
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:41,230
have knowledge about virtualization but

587
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:44,019
not only to have heard about it but

588
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:46,899
really to be knowledgeable and I come

589
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:50,559
back to the example of the candles they

590
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:53,229
I told you about the process you end up

591
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,110
with back pain and this is not an easy

592
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:59,139
profession it's just as technology

593
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,029
technology is not easy technology has to

594
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:03,840
be studied you have to learn it you have

595
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:09,569
to devote hours nobody gives anything

596
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:14,109
for granted and with the candles we can

597
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:16,329
speak about other similar there is not

598
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:19,808
such a thing as a red bottom that you

599
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:22,839
can press only the candles don't you

600
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:25,839
think that without tops it just gives

601
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:30,299
you a report and the report you give it

602
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,299
to the judge but if you cannot

603
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:38,750
defend it it would not be worth it you

604
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:42,790
have to work yourself on many things and

605
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:47,418
this is the attitude of a good forensic

606
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:51,589
at court is important to be able to

607
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:53,719
defend your report here is with

608
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:59,839
everything at stake you can have a

609
00:34:53,719 --> 00:35:05,959
terrific report with five emails he

610
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:10,069
usually needs 50 to 60 pages long this

611
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,660
is an expert report of only five emails

612
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:14,779
the judge is not going to read

613
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:20,868
everything but the conclusions and is

614
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:26,619
you in the courtroom where you can have

615
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:29,839
an impact on the judge ruling so start

616
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:32,030
learning to speak in public you should

617
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:37,910
be able to communicate otherwise you

618
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:41,440
will have a problem about the body while

619
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:44,868
we continue with this metaphor

620
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,309
especially for the young of the things

621
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:53,210
that we can do in computing autopsies

622
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:57,319
they have a relation of all the USBs

623
00:35:53,210 --> 00:36:00,589
that were plugged into this device if we

624
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:04,819
speak about the dead person the scraping

625
00:36:00,589 --> 00:36:12,290
when CSI look at the nails to see

626
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:15,349
whether they have sand and the used USB

627
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:17,990
and it's important I remember about a

628
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:20,359
case this is a partner of a company that

629
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,180
it gets really gross wants to live and

630
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:24,828
ask the IT experts about the server

631
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,919
function in X

632
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:31,279
in him that he has hard-disk

633
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,650
a second hard disk in mirroring in a

634
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:36,650
constant image but also has all the

635
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:40,069
information on the back up and this

636
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:42,680
person remembers this day said okay

637
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:44,930
there are two hardest error the equal is

638
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:50,200
very clear to me so what did he do

639
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:56,839
one day at night he entered the office

640
00:36:50,200 --> 00:37:00,739
that had 24 security cameras he gets in

641
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:06,160
he introduced his code the cameras were

642
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:06,160
recording he got close to the server

643
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:18,709
it just gets get hold of the hard disk

644
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:21,229
but unluckily the IT expert days before

645
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:26,868
adjusting so little hard disk with a few

646
00:37:21,229 --> 00:37:30,828
things but he went into the wrong hard

647
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:38,199
disk but so that they didn't realize he

648
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:38,199
cursed computer gets the hard disk out

649
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:47,390
fix it in the bay and give it back to

650
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:52,118
the server so then you have to do an

651
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:56,719
expert report when you have to prove in

652
00:37:52,119 --> 00:38:01,809
timeline how this person entered into

653
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:05,029
the office how the video camera are

654
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:08,319
recording how they witches are real are

655
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:12,140
not manipulated and then the always

656
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:16,670
shows that it has been moved it has an

657
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:20,828
incident and it's been black another

658
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:25,939
device has been blocked in so

659
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:29,569
from here we can get a great deal of

660
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:32,479
information something else that is

661
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:34,819
important when we carry out our not of

662
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:36,888
saying if we see the body the most

663
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:40,159
important one of the most important part

664
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:43,309
is the stomach well the dead person has

665
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:47,089
eaten and we have some commands the

666
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:52,399
hosta activity that speaks about the

667
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:56,509
latest executions execute or files etc

668
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:59,689
and when you open up a stomach you see

669
00:38:56,509 --> 00:39:03,469
some disgusting things when you are a

670
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:06,469
forensic ICD expert

671
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:12,909
you will also see some disgusting things

672
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:17,299
and you should be ready I whenever I

673
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:19,969
finish the presentation or speech that I

674
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:22,729
always have somebody that says I want to

675
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:26,419
get into somebody's PC because my

676
00:39:22,729 --> 00:39:29,299
girlfriend this or that to get into a

677
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:33,408
third person private life can be

678
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:37,429
dangerous I think you should think that

679
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:42,669
we are humans and sometimes we see

680
00:39:37,429 --> 00:39:51,309
things that are difficult to digest

681
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:54,828
honest humans we my phone so another

682
00:39:51,309 --> 00:39:57,409
similar with fifteen thousand candles I

683
00:39:54,829 --> 00:40:00,409
didn't put them all of them but the

684
00:39:57,409 --> 00:40:02,749
weather with a team I was living this

685
00:40:00,409 --> 00:40:05,389
theme if you're going to be in the world

686
00:40:02,749 --> 00:40:09,019
of forensics you should have good

687
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:14,180
colleagues and friends even more you

688
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:16,970
know that you are under disclosure

689
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,040
but sometimes you should explain what

690
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:22,959
you're touching without giving data but

691
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:26,060
you need it you should also think that

692
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,250
some years ago the world of cyber

693
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:31,070
security in forensics we only had one

694
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:35,120
textbook a year now we have so much

695
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:39,200
information and we cannot manage all and

696
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:44,170
you need groups and teams and peers so

697
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:46,759
they filter part of the information so I

698
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:49,220
want you to know that sometimes you have

699
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,620
to deal with things and you should be

700
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,740
ready and you should use your own

701
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:58,520
resources to get out of those dark

702
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:01,339
things I use candles as you say of the

703
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:06,590
good or positive things we can see as to

704
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:12,200
know where a person had seen I find this

705
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:16,400
in labor relations cases the majority of

706
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:19,609
autopsies although you may not end up in

707
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,580
court they end up just being a report

708
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:25,130
maybe the manager of the company

709
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:29,680
contacts you and say I want to know what

710
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:34,360
the same policeman and be aware of this

711
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:39,080
you need consent whether you can or not

712
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:43,190
look into somebody's computer and then

713
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:47,690
you can do a report explaining what time

714
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:51,400
this person looks in whether is working

715
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:55,180
whether is checking on the work or just

716
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:58,370
surfing the net looking for different

717
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:01,430
subjects so we have those tools that

718
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:03,680
allow us to see what they see about what

719
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:06,529
they see this is just a demonstration

720
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,859
even though is in Catalan

721
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:14,270
sometimes what you see is not what it

722
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:19,520
seems I'm here I'd like to speak about

723
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:24,080
false evidence forensic there are duties

724
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:26,240
to find the truth on many occasions we

725
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,860
see false evidence evidence can be

726
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:33,859
manipulated you can modify what's up

727
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:37,190
conversations first how can you know

728
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:40,580
that this conversation is false just at

729
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:45,530
the first sight you know is false

730
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:48,520
because it's 1921 and it has 72% of

731
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:52,280
battery and this doesn't happen at home

732
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:56,990
this is one of the demos when you speak

733
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:59,510
with charters of lawyers or judges you

734
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:01,370
say that tell them that evidence can be

735
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,620
manipulated and that there are some

736
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:06,350
applications that allow you to make the

737
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:09,049
perfect simulation of a whatsapp

738
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:12,529
conversation this person might tell you

739
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:14,240
that the conversation he eliminated the

740
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:17,360
conversation but he has just a

741
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,479
screenshot and this is what here see my

742
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:25,880
present so you have to prove whether

743
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:29,450
this is true or not because a person can

744
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:33,520
have a problem a very serious problem so

745
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:36,520
we aware of a false evidence as this

746
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,520
month

747
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:43,569
you know you can also simulate the

748
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:46,880
Facebook conversation I totally faked

749
00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:49,670
Facebook profile yeah you know that

750
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:54,789
Pokemon would people learned what not to

751
00:43:49,670 --> 00:44:00,339
look for those but they learned to

752
00:43:54,789 --> 00:44:02,680
modify the GPS position now the oldest

753
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:06,558
generation of pokemons

754
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:09,799
that will from here on there will have a

755
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:16,700
mother although they will have a

756
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:18,709
girlfriend they may fake the location

757
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:23,209
during and here I come to the most

758
00:44:18,709 --> 00:44:25,669
interesting but they forensics like to

759
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:28,519
have a woman not because of that but

760
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:30,529
because women gives more information

761
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:32,959
that men do you can have whether they

762
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:37,339
had sexual relations or not where has

763
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:41,239
inside and provides more information now

764
00:44:37,339 --> 00:44:47,569
here I'm going to explain something

765
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:51,979
related to Facebook blackmail and I made

766
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:54,288
a protocol to be given to no enforcement

767
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:57,739
but they said that they could help

768
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:59,869
people and I will explain here that you

769
00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:04,579
don't have all you don't need technical

770
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:06,920
knowledge of my profession I can tell

771
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:09,979
you that what is really fulfilling is to

772
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:12,799
be able to help you find situation when

773
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:16,399
you see that people need help and about

774
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:20,180
this example is not technical but you

775
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,400
help the person this is the true cases

776
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:25,848
the day before yesterday just before

777
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,479
getting the plane this girl asked a for

778
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:31,730
a friendship do you think is normal

779
00:45:28,479 --> 00:45:37,210
yeah it's normal why

780
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:40,400
normally this type of woman of the

781
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:42,770
thousands of men in Facebook has chosen

782
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,150
me it shows that she is smart she has a

783
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:52,520
good taste and she shows many things but

784
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:55,309
it's not only that but her friend also

785
00:45:52,520 --> 00:46:00,440
sent me a friend request those are the

786
00:45:55,309 --> 00:46:04,970
profiles that are used and you know is

787
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:07,430
the typical Facebook blackmail a very

788
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:10,759
good looking straight in looking girl

789
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:13,069
since you friend requests these and you

790
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:17,559
have to be humble but people get into

791
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:21,500
the trick were nobody to judge when we

792
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:26,630
work along a victim people that were

793
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:30,970
dealing with all of them all of them are

794
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:36,200
victims are victims that are suffering

795
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:39,919
for either psychological harassment they

796
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:43,308
mean stolen they had a nurse and you

797
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:47,450
have to deal with them this is something

798
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:49,490
that you should get ready you might be

799
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:52,640
very good technician but if you don't

800
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:56,868
have empathy you should work on this

801
00:46:52,640 --> 00:47:00,520
that was this Facebook striking woman

802
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:00,520
sends you a friend request

803
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:06,200
send information about what she comes

804
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,180

00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:17,450
show me your neck show me your the body

826
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:20,690
little by little and some people just go

827
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:24,529
for it what happens when things are

828
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:27,470
really high she says I'm gonna show you

829
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:30,530
an erotic video and you say yes you see

830
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:33,470
the video and you are the main character

831
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:38,000
in this video you've been recorded and

832
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:40,569
there is one used move from fantastic

833
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:47,270
situation into having a real problem

834
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:51,050
they have my penis somewhere in the net

835
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:55,089
and then she says you I know he's your

836
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:59,210
girlfriend your colleagues and your

837
00:48:55,089 --> 00:49:01,730
family I'm going to owe you pay me or

838
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:03,740
you will have a problem and many people

839
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,340
really get blocked because they are

840
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,410
under a shock

841
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:11,130
you know the problem with this black

842
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:13,470
male was that many people just kept

843
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:16,260
silent and just paid and you have a

844
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:19,080
problem if you pay the first day you

845
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:22,890
will pay the second and the third and

846
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:26,009
the second day this woman will not get

847
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:29,430
in touch with you but my but her

848
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:32,310
cornholed sister and then you will have

849
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:37,770
to go on paying people that did refused

850
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:40,529
to pay they went to law enforcement but

851
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:47,190
the saying I have a problem you present

852
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:50,910
a claim and then well this the case is

853
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:53,280
quite difficult to explain and what

854
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:58,220
happened that you went to her house with

855
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:02,910
this note and with a great problem they

856
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:10,230
when once you got home the criminal went

857
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:15,830
on I found cases where people where

858
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:19,250
really bound to do any crazy thing

859
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:22,620
because of the stress and there is a

860
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:25,440
trend that they are recording you and

861
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:28,830
when they go down and there's a camera

862
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,930
movement with some shading and they

863
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:35,779
continue with a body that does not

864
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:39,359
belong to you it's another one but also

865
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:43,010
nine year old girl and the title of the

866
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:45,570
video is mr. X a pedophile is

867
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:49,530
masturbating in front of a nine year old

868
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:52,610
girl and if this is in your social media

869
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:56,460
you will really be in trouble so I

870
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:58,770
created a protocol about how to act in

871
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:02,150
this situation the only thing you have

872
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:06,790
to do is keep calm cut the communication

873
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:09,910
with a criminal with a person

874
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:13,420
so that she can no longer contact you

875
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:16,029
they are just mafias they don't care

876
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:18,040
they don't give a damn about you they

877
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:21,700
just want to reach a next number of

878
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:24,910
people I found situations when I was

879
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:29,830
speaking to the criminals in Spanish and

880
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:34,750
they will take it in Italian or so there

881
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:38,040
was also translator so let's see that

882
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:44,230
you only interrupt in the communication

883
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:47,310
that's a good solution and we expect we

884
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:53,530
should help our society and people

885
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:56,920
because this is just a serious problem I

886
00:51:53,530 --> 00:52:01,300
just have five more minutes I spoke

887
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:03,460
about the web browser and one of the

888
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:07,090
things that we can do in a lot of things

889
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:10,800
to get the passwords there are hosted in

890
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:14,800
the browsers this is very useful when

891
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,810
you're dealing with dead people this is

892
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:21,580
something that is going to be very much

893
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:25,930
discussed Digital inheritance I went a

894
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:30,609
course a case about a woman 40-something

895
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:33,640
year old she died in a car accident it

896
00:52:30,609 --> 00:52:36,759
was a dramatic for her family her

897
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:39,220
husband picks up the phone and the

898
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:42,609
social media and gets into the social

899
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:45,819
media and he finds out about the life of

900
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:51,009
this person this person gets really

901
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:56,170
gross and using the profile of the woman

902
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:57,440
that could burst away starts trying to

903
00:52:56,170 --> 00:53:00,950
blackmail

904
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:05,780
be in the past there was not a registry

905
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:07,660
of what we did but now it is the case

906
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:10,250
and I can give you many other examples

907
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:12,560
the same can be said about the mail

908
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:15,109
password so you can get all our

909
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:18,619
passwords and you know that once you get

910
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:26,060
some password from the browser and the

911
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:29,540
email you know that almost everybody

912
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:31,609
uses the same password for everything do

913
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:36,880
you think that person forensics use

914
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:41,810
those four simple tools well no in fact

915
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:44,210
who use tools who use the right type of

916
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:49,040
tools it's important for people to know

917
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:52,160
that not only the bad guys can do and

918
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,700
get under way but there are people like

919
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:59,270
us that are looking for this evidence

920
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:01,220
and that they are not in pain people

921
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:03,980
might think that they're limiting and

922
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:06,078
impunity go hand by hand there is not

923
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:09,140
such a thing as a known enemy to your

924
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:13,430
impunity in the net that's why we are

925
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:16,490
here I could speak about many other

926
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:19,879
things about profiles but I rather give

927
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:23,209
you five minutes that you can ask me

928
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:24,550
questions any questions please use the

929
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:30,349
microphone

930
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:34,220
Daniel Murphy no no escucha most nada I

931
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:39,700
have a question in the court code level

932
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:44,480
to be a computer expert do you need any

933
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:48,049
certification how can you prove you can

934
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:51,710
say that you are an IT expert

935
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:53,480
and you have to make a report and the

936
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:55,820
judge might take it into account

937
00:54:53,480 --> 00:55:02,480
just like these do you have any type of

938
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:05,930
certification in the slide about

939
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:10,600
profiles my advice is when you go and

940
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:13,669
train on cybersecurity be aware of where

941
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:17,569
you are trained there are many different

942
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:21,020
courses and seminars and associations of

943
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:27,010
experts that have a rather bombastic

944
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:32,350
name but in fact they they are nothing

945
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:38,680
formal education and about the experts

946
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:38,680
we will try to have an official

947
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:48,590
Association because now the Greece are

948
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:52,370
very easily given so you find out God's

949
00:55:48,590 --> 00:56:00,470
people without the necessary level you

950
00:55:52,370 --> 00:56:06,200
can be and act as an expert from for the

951
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:10,939
court or by third party because you are

952
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:14,390
in a list and you are called but

953
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:18,920
unluckily today you only have to prove

954
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:24,049
that you have an expertise more and more

955
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:26,680
judges are starting to request or is the

956
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:31,060
real education you have formal education

957
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:32,450
if you like the world of forensics and

958
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:36,380
research

959
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:39,350
don't be always freelance the law

960
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:44,060
enforcement agencies and this is a very

961
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:49,890
good possibility if I was younger in

962
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:52,500
fact I would go on this direction

963
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:55,200
thank you for your presentation very

964
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:59,870
interesting presentation but I'd like to

965
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:03,779
make a comment I am from the school of

966
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:09,569
computer engineers in Cantabria we pass

967
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:15,780
a list to the court either to be public

968
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:19,590
once anybody can ask for an expert we

969
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:25,190
pass the list around and you need to be

970
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:28,980
a member of the Association Jews have an

971
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:36,200
engineering degree and at least have

972
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:39,690
attended courses on computing expert

973
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:42,569
report and to conclude I like to stay

974
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:44,730
after everything that happened with his

975
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:50,090
autopsy and it was a very interesting

976
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:52,800
session it was really fun and turn ashes

977
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:58,020
Bartlett said something that stayed with

978
00:57:52,800 --> 00:58:02,340
me you can be more damaging with a

979
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:04,320
computer an IT device than with a gun we

980
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:10,170
thickened you can threaten or you can

981
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:15,470
kill but how much damage can you get

982
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:20,670
with a computer is variable the victims

983
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:22,919
they might also need people to support

984
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:25,770
them and you can imagine about all those

985
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:28,110
new professions that are being now

986
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:33,090
created thanks to cybersecurity and

987
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:35,690
that's all I wanted to say I'm available

988
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:37,260
do you hear you have my email address a
