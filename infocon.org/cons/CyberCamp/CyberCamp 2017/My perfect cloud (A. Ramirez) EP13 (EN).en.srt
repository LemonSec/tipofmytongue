1
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,900
we are about to start I would like to

2
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:30,860
thank you all for being here today

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:36,710
the idea is to create a perfect cloud I

4
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:38,600
will now explain what do we mean by

5
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,230
perfect

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:47,820
well I'm going to introduce who we are I

7
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,940
don't know if you know sick admin is a

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:56,420
cybersecurity conference held in Seville

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:01:04,500
in the south of Spain and we are known

10
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:10,770
because the finalists of the city F that

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:17,729
is now our competition thanks to cyber

12
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:22,050
camp and what do we do I will just

13
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:31,259
introduce ourselves this is our Twitter

14
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:34,020
sec admin the wife followed by a 1 what

15
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:41,149
I said this is the winner

16
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:44,640
and this is the kitane worries about the

17
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:49,289
weapon has a parallelism with the world

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:54,179
of Hawkins ninjas and Samurai and it

19
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:59,399
symbolizes the effort philosophy and

20
00:01:54,179 --> 00:02:06,599
ethics morale and is the most important

21
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:09,380
award for the CTF this is this time it

22
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,380
was quite

23
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,670
difficulty he could open two locks in 58

24
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,349
seconds

25
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:23,760
it requires abilities not only in using

26
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:27,579
reverse in cryptography but also

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,929
physical he had very strong hands and

28
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:38,739
could open it and he the winner is with

29
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:44,549
us today and room to our left you can

30
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:46,720
follow us this is our Twitter as I said

31
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:55,750
this is what we do

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:59,440
some of us my know us this is one of the

33
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,810
creators of SQL map that you can see now

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,980
in the screen we also organized the

35
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:09,390
context who is the sexiest meters lab

36
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:12,640
was the winner is also with us and

37
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:16,149
LinkedIn profiles are very rigid so I

38
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:22,200
wanted to give some humor we have fun we

39
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:27,880
enjoy and above all we share knowledge

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:33,010
this is the main objective this is a

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:36,639
video of the katana or sword this is the

42
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:40,090
bomb that we had to deactivate he had

43
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:44,019
three locks once you do a reversing you

44
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:52,109
got the number of a numeric look and

45
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:57,730
once you opened it you could unlock the

46
00:03:52,109 --> 00:04:00,549
following two locks to deactivate the

47
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:08,700
bomb so as I said we come from Seville

48
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:13,900
her name is SEC admin and this is me I

49
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:19,298
am a forensic computer expert I work a

50
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:21,640
cyber security director at Dahlberg for

51
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:23,049
more than two years I love technology I

52
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,120
love social

53
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,490
Engineering have been working in this

54
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,690
field for years and I always define

55
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,449
social engineering as the glue that can

56
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:38,050
link many different techniques you can

57
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:42,400
be good in different techniques but if

58
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:46,180
you do not glue them with social

59
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,090
engineering when making an intrusion

60
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,639
there's nothing we can do so I love

61
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,330
social engineering I like observing

62
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,520
people learning from people I

63
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,620
responsible for said I mean and I am

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,990
from all the way and we are nice in that

65
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,539
country

66
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:08,650
Chadwicks on and I carry out the cyber

67
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:10,780
security audits I'm a consultant in

68
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,870
cyber security let us move now to the

69
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:18,580
topic of my presentation which is a

70
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:21,849
perfect cloud there's a website the name

71
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:26,190
is Hall 2 for I don't know if you know

72
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:29,770
it it has some tutorials for Linux and

73
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:33,819
you see all the distributions they teach

74
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:37,359
us how to do certain things they have a

75
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:39,639
section that is entitled the perfect

76
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,389
setup or the perfect server they give us

77
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:48,159
information or tips to create a perfect

78
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:51,779
server that's why I selected the title

79
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:55,990
of this talk as the perfect cloud I will

80
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:58,449
show you some steps to make a round

81
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:02,009
knock louder today we are in the world

82
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:06,279
of sharing in a world where technology

83
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:11,080
is in the cloud so we can all share the

84
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:14,169
information and let us see how can we do

85
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,909
it so basically I will speak about the

86
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:21,940
existing services market shares options

87
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:24,819
to create our own cloud deployment and

88
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:28,300
implementation of this cloud we will do

89
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:30,909
it live so I will be changing the

90
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,050
screens quite often I will speak about

91
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:38,438
my cloud order the settings were

92
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:41,930
possibilities given by around cloud

93
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:46,879
versus what exist in the market I would

94
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:49,849
ask you to work with this cloud to share

95
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:52,969
photographs load videos change

96
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:55,430
information we will see how we can keep

97
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:59,270
the information in the cloud how can we

98
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:02,840
monitor the performance of we develop

99
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,998
security how can we strengthen the cloud

100
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,448
in relation to security we'll going to

101
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:11,840
have the data there those informations

102
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:14,629
have to be secured whether in the cloud

103
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,878
or in the existing infrastructure we are

104
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,430
going to speak about hardening measures

105
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,909
and then some conclusions and I would

106
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:32,719
also like to interact with you and have

107
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:35,180
your feedback about the cloud okay we

108
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:40,009
never would speak about the cloud what

109
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:43,490
are we talking about basically visual

110
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:47,029
hard disk that have a great large

111
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:50,870
capacity we will access always via

112
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:55,430
internet in the past thing was crazy but

113
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:59,089
today with fiber we have a huge speed

114
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:05,719
and it's very possible to download a 20

115
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:08,149
30 gigabytes file great speed remember

116
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:10,219
when we were connected to a modem we

117
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:12,169
could see sequence by sequence and

118
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:14,330
sometimes there were mistakes and

119
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:18,139
everything was in gray this is no longer

120
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:21,378
the case we can see photographs in real

121
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:24,919
time we can see all contents of the

122
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:30,080
website we can download films or we can

123
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:32,630
view films online as in Netflix HBO and

124
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,669
in similar platforms and we can listen

125
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:43,460
to music everything online what is the

126
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:49,819
purpose of the cloud basically is

127
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:53,820
place in an interconnected world to keep

128
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:58,950
photographs videos music and all sort of

129
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:01,070
files that we might need to access or

130
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:05,850
that give us the possibility to access

131
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:10,410
anytime many of you have been working at

132
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:13,110
home go to work and looks in the USB for

133
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:18,689
something that you had saved and is not

134
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:21,840
there is a Europe homes desktop if we

135
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,570
had a place with a synchronization to

136
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,740
the cloud and I can access the cloud and

137
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:31,590
download it I forget about USB because I

138
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:36,120
always carry the information with me

139
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:40,140
mobility is the main advantage we can

140
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:43,470
free memory of our devices we will see

141
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,580
that this is relative but we can upload

142
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,040
the photographs put them in a different

143
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:53,700
folder that is not synchronized and you

144
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,449
can do it without using our tablet or

145
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,330
cell phones memory capacity and what we

146
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,920
always looked with the network

147
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:06,120
centralized the information I know that

148
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,400
all my information is in this cloud and

149
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,790
I don't have to be looking for

150
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:16,610
information in different places this is

151
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:20,430
the aim when having our own cloud

152
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:23,960
obviously the market has realized these

153
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:26,819
needs and offers different possibilities

154
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:31,680
if you don't know the icons we have

155
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:37,279
Dropbox Google Drive one cloud iCloud

156
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:40,758
box mega and Amazon

157
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:46,999
cloud driver this is just a sample of

158
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:49,069
all possibilities for storing they you

159
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:56,600
have to pay for them because it's

160
00:10:49,069 --> 00:11:01,819
something new what we do what they do is

161
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:06,019
they let us try the system Google Drive

162
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:10,248
give us 15 gigabytes we see the

163
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:13,399
advantages but with time after several

164
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:18,680
months or years if we upload four or

165
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:21,649
five always imaging or if we keep large

166
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:26,899
documents then the space is filled and

167
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:29,600
we have become used to this so what do

168
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:33,319
we do we end up buying Hostin which is

169
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,980
the business of all of this all of them

170
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:41,029
do it

171
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:45,170
I turned for iers you have five gigabyte

172
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:48,559
and when they are full it offers a

173
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:54,079
backup in the cloud when everything is

174
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:56,930
full we rather pay is not very much

175
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,469
money what you pay on a monthly basis

176
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:03,829
and enlarge your capacity now we're

177
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:06,730
great generators of multimedia contents

178
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:09,859
videos photographs when we go on a trip

179
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:15,980
you don't do just 24 photographs you

180
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:20,540
might do 200 or 300 so it's normal to

181
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:24,679
start using great volumes of information

182
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:29,120
in photographs music so it's not enough

183
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:30,949
to have in an MPT the song we like we

184
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,230
want to have all the records of our

185
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:36,949
favorite singer those are the solutions

186
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:40,160
offered by the market the problems for

187
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:42,769
the middle user they are good theorem

188
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,579
they are not very expensive but there

189
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:51,050
are some risks

190
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:55,649
and those rays can be classified as some

191
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:59,430
do you remember Mira upload there are

192
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:03,300
many links in Internet that ping-pong to

193
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:08,099
mega upload pages he was close by the

194
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:17,040
FBI considering that he had a great part

195
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:23,370
of unlicensed programs films illegally

196
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:25,920
information but what the FBI forgets is

197
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,649
that nigga upload had business

198
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:33,540
information fully little information

199
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:38,790
that when they seized them nigga upload

200
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:41,069
servers the company owners could no

201
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,699
longer access the information that was

202
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:47,520
distorted and this is a risk if tomorrow

203
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,579
if we keep her information in a cloud

204
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,870
that we think is never going to be

205
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:58,729
closed who thinks that Google might

206
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:02,160
disappear one day or Amazon or iTunes

207
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:07,500
but we never know what may happen

208
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,270
we'll never know what the future can

209
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,170
bring about on one day but we thought it

210
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:16,350
was security might no longer be the case

211
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:19,439
so the idea is if I can have my own

212
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,810
infrastructure I will try to create it

213
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,290
myself

214
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:31,439
this is one of the reasons not so long

215
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:35,819
ago it were a Snowden came into the

216
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:40,890
public domain and he made public some

217
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:45,589
actions that and as a the US government

218
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,589
was doing in relation to

219
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:52,810
agreements with companies I don't want

220
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:58,540
to say the names but important companies

221
00:14:52,810 --> 00:15:01,989
that offer hosting services but

222
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:06,010
accessing their information for research

223
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:09,790
purposes for tourism but it's true

224
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:13,149
that he opened up our eyes to the fact

225
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:16,990
that privacy is important and on many

226
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:21,490
occasions depending on when where we

227
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:26,850
store our information our privacy might

228
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,850
be in danger this is one of the reasons

229
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,680
set in our own cloud and we can

230
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,170
guarantee her in fresher that's why I

231
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,370
speak about a perfect cloud and we can

232
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:43,000
access to it without we can access all

233
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:46,060
this data without problems what are we

234
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,279
looking for let us make a small summary

235
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:53,109
of what we're looking for looking for

236
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:59,350
privacy some phenols if you're using

237
00:15:53,110 --> 00:16:02,290
Google Drive or other systems to protect

238
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:07,000
the users they automatically analyze our

239
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:10,449
files and if those files have malware or

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,020
a suspicious file sometimes we cannot

241
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:17,800
download them or upload them and this is

242
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:20,800
a problem if we are analyzing malware

243
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,890
and we need samples of these viruses or

244
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:28,300
were working with certain files related

245
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:31,510
to security or it's in pen testing those

246
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:34,599
antivirus just classify them as medicine

247
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:36,760
we cannot upload them so at least in my

248
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,899
personal experience when I want to

249
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,970
download some of the files in the cloud

250
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:46,089
the message is that it has a virus he

251
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:49,390
cannot be downloaded and it just erase

252
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,950
it to avoid this we might have our own

253
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:56,060
cloud with our own rules

254
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:59,510
now we save money on a long-term we are

255
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:03,680
paying for the cloud service between

256
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:06,740
nine ten euros a month we will see the

257
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,639
different choices but we can pay just a

258
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:12,709
little bit more or the same but you are

259
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,100
going to have an infrastructure that you

260
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:19,819
can control yourselves which is quite an

261
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:22,428
advantage compared to what Sun in the

262
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:25,428
market you might have total control of

263
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,890
your data you will know what's happening

264
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:30,950
who are accessing those data viewer the

265
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:36,049
admin of your own server you will know

266
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:40,429
who is accessing your data if there are

267
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:43,580
in outers cloud you don't know who might

268
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:46,669
be accessing this information in case of

269
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:50,030
an event and this is as a forensic there

270
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:54,100
may be an event in a company where

271
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:59,690
employee X from home had downloaded

272
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:03,139
company's information or that they has

273
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:07,400
been outside that a key doesn't have to

274
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:10,250
be insider and we want to know they used

275
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,700
to attack when we're speaking about an

276
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:16,010
external server we need a court order to

277
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,100
be able to carry out this forensic

278
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:23,419
research if an incident happens with our

279
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:26,719
cloud we own on the server so we could

280
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:29,780
just analyze all the server logs to see

281
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,570
exactly who connected our time from

282
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:36,320
where whether this personal group is

283
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:39,760
still attacking the server with honey

284
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,659
files and we can control the situation

285
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:47,140
otherwise we just have a folder we pay

286
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:50,690
every month but we don't know the rest

287
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:55,650
so with a run cloud we can control our

288
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:59,330
own information then your clouds

289
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:03,270
storage capacity is limited to your disk

290
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:07,500
capacity when you hire a plan you can

291
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:10,650
contract 100 200 300 gigabytes one

292
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:14,250
terabyte but when you have your own

293
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:16,640
cloud you set the limited whether you

294
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:20,910
want to use it yourself or you want to

295
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,530
share it with different users maja the

296
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:27,960
bigger the infrastructure the greater

297
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:30,649
the capacity few days ago I was speaking

298
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:35,059
about the potential infrastructure of a

299
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:40,770
local council and they were given 50

300
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:43,320
Giga bytes per user I will give you some

301
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:46,770
other examples therefore we can define

302
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:52,100
an administer they tack up storage

303
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:55,190
capacity we can use this as a backup

304
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:58,980
when you are working as systems

305
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:03,179
administrators or at home it's

306
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:07,590
interesting always keep a backup and the

307
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:12,090
question is to do it in the cloud or in

308
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:15,149
a device but the USB charger connected

309
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:18,480
to the PC so you may have a malware

310
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:20,730
attacks here we have the possibility to

311
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,120
carry out the backups

312
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,690
in the cloud we can synchronize it to do

313
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:33,709
it at night and it doesn't use too much

314
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:38,160
bandwidth we can also recover previous

315
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:40,380
versions of a document up until 30 if I

316
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,730
modified or erase something from a

317
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,080
document I can go to the previous

318
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:50,990
version and see the previous document

319
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:53,399
before the changes and my data are

320
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:56,910
accessible

321
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,930
from everywhere whether in Santander or

322
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:07,590
in Sevilla in China in any country just

323
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:19,170
with internet access I can see my data

324
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:24,209
in the cloud is what are the potential

325
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:26,750
solutions at the level of principle we

326
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,770
have unclouded net cloud

327
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:34,580
according to southern southern has

328
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:39,870
limited information but help us to see

329
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:45,120
what's going on in Jerusalem search this

330
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:55,439
morning and found 3321 sites that are

331
00:21:45,120 --> 00:22:01,830
using unclouded 3321 in germany 718 in

332
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:06,200
France 561 in United States 461 in the

333
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:09,120
Netherlands 1717 in United Kingdom

334
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:13,140
several hundred dollar data from Sodom

335
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,110
there are many more there are hundreds

336
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,500
of thousands of organizations that are

337
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:26,250
using our cloud or net cloud and about

338
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:32,190
Spain and before this just a small

339
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:35,400
comment aside did you get to know it'll

340
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:38,820
ocean the small drop digital ocean is

341
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,100
the place where you can rent a server he

342
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,520
was five years in the past nine ten

343
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:48,990
years you can have a 30 gigabytes server

344
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:53,250
and you can set your cloud there with

345
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:55,570
fixed IP with internet connection good

346
00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:00,340
broadband

347
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:04,470
then you have Dutch Telecom orange OVH

348
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:10,600
is French and OVH telecom those are the

349
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:14,999
organizations that southern indicates

350
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:18,399
that we have cloud services let us now

351
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:24,399
see what with what southern finds in

352
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:30,428
Spain on cloud is previous version and

353
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:34,018
there are around 70 sites you can see

354
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:39,929
them by provinces Madrid Barcelona

355
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:44,259
Valencia therethis V only - not ours yet

356
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:47,200
with unplowed and with net cloud which

357
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:50,739
is the one I will be focusing on it

358
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,739
finds 24 rincon de la victoria Madrid

359
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:55,419
with a big Valencia and there's

360
00:23:53,739 --> 00:24:01,210
something else that I didn't highlight

361
00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:06,690
yet and let's see if we see it here have

362
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:13,470
you seen the protocols the using of the

363
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:18,369
3321 found a slightly over 50 are using

364
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:22,509
HTTP the rest are using clear text all

365
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:25,269
the women that they are using HTTP if I

366
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:28,370
have my cloud in HTTP and I connect to

367
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:31,190
the net and somebody is a little

368
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:34,850
listening to this traffic my connection

369
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:37,580
to the cloud is in clean text and any

370
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:41,080
attacker can get our ID and get into our

371
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:45,320
cloud so we should really be aware about

372
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:52,820
security we can speak about 40 something

373
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:56,530
percent of unsafe clouds when we speak

374
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:59,270
about the cloud connection here we are

375
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:02,420
examples of clouds there are many

376
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:05,840
organizations for example universities

377
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:11,380
are using the cloud this is the European

378
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:15,080
University Don Miguel de Cervantes here

379
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:22,940
you have the Polytechnic University of

380
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:26,270
valence telefónica I don't know if this

381
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:32,510
is a test or not or a real one and they

382
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:36,020
sound out as its cloud system and the

383
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:39,830
last example university of western

384
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:43,280
madura they give their users storage

385
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:47,059
capacity of 5 gigabytes the private

386
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,580
cloud is not anything that is only used

387
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:52,670
by a field but by companies and

388
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:55,520
universities is a very useful solution

389
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:59,900
to have your own cloud infrastructure

390
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:05,809
and this is the most interesting part of

391
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:08,750
this section in my presentation I spoke

392
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:13,600
about on cloud and next cloud what's the

393
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:17,030
difference on cloud is a project from a

394
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,120
Khaled a graphic Linux environment it

395
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:26,570
was started in 2010 on the 13th of

396
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:30,110
December 2011 it was created as I said I

397
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,100
knew about them since 2012 we tested to

398
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,959
see how it was

399
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:39,129
Dropbox was very famous at that time and

400
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:42,250
was as cloud computing alternative using

401
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:47,559
free server what are what happened with

402
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:53,950
a next cloud all with our own cloud that

403
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:55,649
brings some of the parts that you have

404
00:26:53,950 --> 00:27:03,240
to pay for them

405
00:26:55,649 --> 00:27:06,879
so it was like spin-off that is called

406
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:11,020
next cloud it has the same philosophy

407
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:15,000
with the same interface but they are

408
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:19,179
100% free that's why for this workshop

409
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,029
we are going to be using next cloud they

410
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:28,620
are basically the same but I would

411
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:33,850
choose free services let us choose the

412
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:38,139
material for our cloud we know about the

413
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:42,789
cloud we know about information storage

414
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:47,130
and what are the materials design or

415
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:52,149
build our cloud one of the possibilities

416
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:54,610
for the cloud is to use raspberry pi I

417
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:59,500
don't know if you know about it a device

418
00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:02,020
that has many different purposes and one

419
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,960
of them can be the following this is a

420
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:09,309
very basic and simple solution 32

421
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:13,870
gigabytes cards with a cluster where you

422
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:19,600
have four connections and I multiply 32

423
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:23,500
/ 4 or I can get memory cards of 64 Giga

424
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:26,320
but and I can have different use

425
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,899
different strategies to build the cloud

426
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:34,000
this is a solution how much does it cost

427
00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:37,389
the Raspberry Pi from 30 to 40 users

428
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,990
with a charger 50 euros

429
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:46,870
with a frame that'll be the cost and the

430
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:49,120
memory cards they cost very little this

431
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:52,899
is a way to set a cloud rather

432
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:57,340
economical one and his grand for a

433
00:28:52,900 --> 00:29:03,990
student that wants to try the cloud can

434
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:07,299
use their house internet connection

435
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:10,540
next cloud thought about it and they

436
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:14,590
sold the frame as you can see is the

437
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:20,049
Raspberry Pi but this frame has a space

438
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:23,490
to introduce a hard disk of 3.5 or you

439
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:27,639
can use some other storage capacities

440
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:32,290
about one terabyte two or three or as

441
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:35,230
many as you wish this is a solution that

442
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:39,190
is quite interesting the only problem I

443
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:42,880
see is that the frame cannot breathe

444
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:45,100
everything is locked mechanically so it

445
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,340
generates Heat and I don't know how the

446
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:53,040
raspberry P will work inside this frame

447
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:58,360
but we can open it up vamos ninos

448
00:29:53,040 --> 00:30:00,399
we can move to level two we're talking

449
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,969
about security issues and we may think

450
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,900
having my data stored in a hard drive is

451
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:09,040
a bit risky

452
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:12,910
I need another system so what you can do

453
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,980
is connect several hard drives or maybe

454
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:18,130
you need more space maybe you want a

455
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:22,809
cloud of six terabytes so this is what

456
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:25,630
you can do you can see how there are

457
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:27,520
different post data storage units

458
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,700
connected to the Raspberry Pi this is

459
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,770
one of the things you can do these are a

460
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:37,750
different set of different materials

461
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:42,418
that you can do to create this cloud if

462
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:44,860
you don't like hard drives because more

463
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:46,890
electrical current is required or

464
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:52,000
because there are no sirree well you can

465
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:55,690
use other storage to units that have 128

466
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,280
Jaeckel but you multiply this by 4 and

467
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:03,190
the storage capability is significantly

468
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,710
increased that's a solution and you

469
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:09,490
cannot go for it here you have the

470
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:12,610
package if you buy the next cloud box it

471
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,620
contains its own Raspberry Pi we're

472
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,459
already at version 3 that you can see

473
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:22,120
the connectors the memory cards as well

474
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:24,910
it's just a matter of assembling all the

475
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:27,250
elements there are other options this

476
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,630
cloud system is extremely interesting so

477
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,120
much so that you have these options

478
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:36,940
available here you can see the web

479
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:40,989
interface of an ass and a s and in this

480
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:44,800
case it offers you the option of setting

481
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:48,280
up next cloud within the na s and na s

482
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:50,830
offer us an interface in which we can

483
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,200
connect ourselves to the Internet by

484
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:56,760
opening a series of pores this is

485
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:01,030
automatically manage them by na yes and

486
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,950
they have y1 and we can manage them from

487
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:07,030
this effect from this is yet another

488
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:10,320
option we don't want to use a respirator

489
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:13,210
or maybe we don't believe it's so

490
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:18,040
trustworthy so to say so we can go for n

491
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:21,280
is what ingredients could we use in

492
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:24,460
order to create the perfect cloud well

493
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:30,070
as I said earlier

494
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:32,380
yes a raspberry a computer it can be a

495
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,720
computer as we did earlier and a server

496
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:38,160
ice tell there's a distinction between a

497
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:42,010
computer and server on computer normal

498
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:46,510
computer a clone computer or brand

499
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:51,190
computer can't work with a normal

500
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:56,560
processor with a Tutera a hard drive we

501
00:32:51,190 --> 00:33:01,900
can transform this computer typical PC

502
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:04,480
computer into next cloud or we can use a

503
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:08,290
server and if it's a company with

504
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,570
redundant sources with network cards

505
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:13,889
with write system we can do something

506
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:16,740
that is more robust and more interesting

507
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:18,910
when creating a secure hardware

508
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,740
infrastructure it depends on how much

509
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:23,950
you're willing to invest and it depends

510
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:26,920
how much info data you want to manage

511
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:29,710
and that's of course these storage units

512
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,050
or devices as for software what software

513
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:36,880
are we kind of going to use we're going

514
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:38,909
to use Linux distro if it's a Raspberry

515
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,220
Pi it would be a liner system that is

516
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:45,190
adapted to Raspberry Pi affairs Nasir

517
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:48,970
Naas you can't go for a next cloud or

518
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:52,950
you can install version in the Inox from

519
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:55,960
scratch and next now it is open source a

520
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:58,480
300% downloadable and of course you need

521
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,820
to do things with great care and

522
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,580
dedication and these are all the

523
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:07,179
ingredients you need in order to set up

524
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,650
the perfect crap now let's see how we

525
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:12,360
can do this step by step

526
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:12,360
any doubts haven't done now No

527
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:25,040
good so we have to set up a cloud and we

528
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:27,379
decided to build cloud that is not gonna

529
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,560
use know that neither a Raspberry Pi nor

530
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:32,690
a computer I'll show you or describe the

531
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,440
structure surely we wanted to create

532
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:40,550
something robust and stable I'll

533
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:43,159
describe this now we can use the next

534
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:47,060
cloud and install it in a computer with

535
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:50,330
Linux and I can also implement a

536
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:52,549
firewall and my next and protected since

537
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,399
her cloud is in the internet and it's

538
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:59,990
exposed we just started to potato with

539
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:04,089
PV sense which is a firewall with a

540
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:07,100
community license meaning that is

541
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:08,630
redistribution fire world for domestic

542
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,118
or household use and we've basically

543
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:14,230
gone for this generally we've chosen

544
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,810
dundun we could have chosen deviant or

545
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:21,800
whatever distributor asides from 1 to n

546
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:26,080
Debian suicune you can choose the one

547
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:30,010
you like most and we've chosen Open VPN

548
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:33,560
which is next cloud and for

549
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:37,510
infrastructure and we've decided to go

550
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:40,040
for a free NASA version you have the

551
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,230
possibility of installing next cloud

552
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,170
with infinite but we're going to use it

553
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:48,500
for storage purposes so on the ass I'll

554
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:50,210
explain okay this is my infrastructure

555
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,330
previously I have two computers her

556
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:57,170
firewall that can act as a router also

557
00:35:53,330 --> 00:36:00,140
behind next out and of course the

558
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:02,480
Internet and on the other hand I have

559
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,700
old sorts of devices to have a

560
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:10,030
smartphones laptop

561
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:12,609
you name it and I be able to access to

562
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,829
this infrastructure from wherever I want

563
00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:19,540
and there are two strategies that need

564
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:24,849
to be underlined here next out as we

565
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:29,829
will see yes exposed to the Internet

566
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:32,680
through an external IP however if we

567
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:36,460
want to provide it with an additional

568
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:39,700
security layer I can set up an Open VPN

569
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,810
into this and what I'm gonna do is to

570
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:47,770
connect myself through vpm to the cloud

571
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:50,619
to the PF sense and this is how going to

572
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:53,290
help me reach the next class - an

573
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:55,780
internal network so next cloud will have

574
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:57,430
an external IP and apparently no

575
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,010
connection to the Internet

576
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:03,609
I'll only be able to access through the

577
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:07,000
VPM accessing an intranet just autism

578
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:10,420
cells every cell next cloud cannot be

579
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,490
seen by Showtime cannot be exposed to

580
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:17,290
internet searches in case of

581
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:19,060
vulnerability for example boot searches

582
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,180
that are looking for an ammonia buddies

583
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:27,099
if I don't have the VPN key that next

584
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:30,460
cloud will be isolated and therefore

585
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:35,369
protected from potential attackers

586
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:35,369
that's the action ok before we begin

587
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:42,279
then we refer to some measures that you

588
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:45,269
can implement to physically protect the

589
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:47,890
machine so as we know computers when

590
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:50,019
started off they boot following a

591
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:54,788
specific order they can boot from a

592
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:56,950
pendrive cd-rom or hard drive how do we

593
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:59,650
physically hack the future well boot

594
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:03,129
seeing it through a pendrive or cd-rom

595
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:05,319
we access the OSS of the cd-rom or

596
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:09,700
pendrive these are techniques that are

597
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:16,239
used to restore windows passwords when

598
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:19,989
the user forgets them and to root more

599
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:21,579
when we access a partition for example

600
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:26,890
from a pendrive so the first thing we

601
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:29,980
need to do is tell the bias to start up

602
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:35,759
directly from the hard drive second we

603
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:40,989
need to protect the be iOS with password

604
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:43,269
so we are forcing that attacker to

605
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:47,200
disassemble the machine remove the

606
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:52,058
battery etc and something else that

607
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:55,390
needs to be done is to control I'll

608
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:58,690
suppress if someone has a physical

609
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:01,230
access to the keyboard someone with the

610
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:05,499
control aural suppress could restore the

611
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:08,259
system so we need to disable this I

612
00:39:05,499 --> 00:39:11,169
don't know if you heard about LVM which

613
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:13,650
is a virtual logical solution that

614
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,759
allows me to encrypt their hard drive

615
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:18,160
LVM has a pro and a con

616
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:20,739
what's the pro the fact that the hard

617
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,950
drive is encrypted so someone wants to

618
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:26,710
access my Linux which contains all the

619
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:29,020
info with the pendrive he will or she

620
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,300
will encounter our fully encrypted unit

621
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:34,300
what we did if someone's physically

622
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:36,160
still is the computer and tries to open

623
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:40,300
the disk that this is going to be

624
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:43,810
encrypted that's the advantage con well

625
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:46,090
when you start of the OS I'm going to be

626
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:49,840
asked for the password in order to

627
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:57,190
continue so we want to automate booting

628
00:39:49,840 --> 00:40:01,869
I mean attack so of course we will have

629
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:03,700
to introduce and the password let me try

630
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:05,940
to do a team of what I'm trying to

631
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,939
explain

632
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:52,880
good

633
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:59,509
here I have my devices my machines this

634
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:02,840
is the Ubuntu you know that window has

635
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,970
two variable server and desktop and I go

636
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:09,290
for server because it doesn't eat a

637
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:18,140
bream so there's the option I go to with

638
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:21,009
the software and what I'm going to use

639
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:24,920
is the one two server

640
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:27,050
well because being traveling all week I

641
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:34,250
didn't have the time to download the

642
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:38,330
image from the server how would this

643
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:43,670
part of the VPN be we can install this

644
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:49,090
in Spanish in English I created an AG

645
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:49,090
good disk no sorry two gigawatts

646
00:41:54,590 --> 00:42:02,390
[Music]

647
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:06,830
it's asking me for more tests no problem

648
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,830
we can add the hard-disk

649
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:20,570
so we're going to add a 10 Jigga white

650
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,570
disk or even 20

651
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:43,320
what's important here is that we need to

652
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:47,950
tell it that we need an LVM unit our

653
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:51,520
device is stolen for whatever reason we

654
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:54,700
need to make sure that that info is

655
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,720
encrypted so we're going to wait a bit

656
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:04,210
for a boon to to pool if we're going to

657
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:07,149
use TV and we follow a deviant given

658
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:13,450
instruction if we use Ubuntu we can use

659
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:18,220
booboo into a server so here we are

660
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:22,439
again we're going to say yes I'm going

661
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,439
to say yes that I want to install it

662
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:34,689
okay this is the key part you have the

663
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:38,319
possibility of having the entire hard

664
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:42,450
drive erased to partition it or we can

665
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:46,240
encrypt the bundle halation for greater

666
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:48,339
security or to install LVM I recommend

667
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,689
this second option there's an advantage

668
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:55,320
if in our partition or our extension we

669
00:43:52,690 --> 00:44:02,380
need to remember the next cloud is a web

670
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:05,800
insulation so it's we can have a unit

671
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:08,380
for example of one Tara devoted to this

672
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,300
if one tier is not enough we can connect

673
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,820
yet another hard drive and we can extend

674
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:16,270
their partition we can introduce another

675
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:18,520
two terabyte hard drive and I end up

676
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:21,520
having three terrorists so that's one of

677
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,530
the advantages of LVM we can use LVM

678
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,680
with encryption are without encryption

679
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:30,720
as you wish so once we have magical here

680
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,410
directly

681
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,950
to use the LVM of ubuntu salvation and

682
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:44,910
we tell it to install it we're not going

683
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:48,930
to do the installation because it would

684
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:51,750
take some time they wouldn't make my

685
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:53,720
sense you talk about isolation so I'm

686
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:57,690
going to leave it here once we install

687
00:44:53,720 --> 00:45:02,430
who won't do and that's what I wanted to

688
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:10,920
explain once we install it we're going

689
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:17,250
to go for the interesting part in this

690
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:21,230
case we have the window installed and

691
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:21,230
I'm going to restart it for you to see

692
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:38,620
when the operating system is about to

693
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:42,690
boot what we see is that it runs

694
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:46,509
normally it executes normally however

695
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:50,950
the disk is encrypted so if it I don't

696
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:52,870
introduce the password all data will be

697
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:57,100
protected and this is one of the

698
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:59,980
advantages interests of security the

699
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:06,880
longer the key the longer the pass for

700
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:10,510
the better and disk can then be

701
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,630
decrypted and decoded you can access a

702
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:15,730
hard drive

703
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,800
as you can see uploaded immediately now

704
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:23,860
I'm going to serve this and I'm going to

705
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:27,400
return to previous screen the virtual

706
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:30,700
machine doesn't allow me to operate

707
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:35,590
multiple screens let's move on with the

708
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:38,859
presentation within via OS once we

709
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:41,800
install the operating system the

710
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:44,740
operating system is a compilation we

711
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:54,180
downloaded and once we install that we

712
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:57,970
do on ap update apt updates we update

713
00:46:54,180 --> 00:47:03,100
all the modifications and of the pending

714
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:05,350
updates and then we install the LS CH

715
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:09,370
and we have a console to be able to

716
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:11,620
interact with that device if he your

717
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:13,630
hard drive face encrypted this isn't an

718
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,520
option if it's not encrypted it's not

719
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:18,640
going to ask for a password you can

720
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:21,910
introduce a test in chrome so that the

721
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,799
OS can be updated every X time to make

722
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,509
sure that it's still the updated let's

723
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:30,010
be very careful when deciding this

724
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:33,610
because there can be an update there's

725
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:35,620
not good of the food for our next cloud

726
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,900
version so let's be careful when going

727
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:42,520
for this option ok

728
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:49,330
let's move on the next cloud insulation

729
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:52,630
has some no difficulty you install a PC

730
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:56,470
I recommend a party you install a

731
00:47:52,630 --> 00:48:00,190
database Maria Divi we download the last

732
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:02,549
next cloud version and version 12

733
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:05,890
forgave me some promise so I downloaded

734
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:08,950
and installed version 11 for this

735
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:11,319
workshop it's stable you need to have an

736
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:15,460
updated version regardless of the number

737
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:21,940
then enable the HTTP in this web server

738
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:27,100
don't make the mistake made by so many

739
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:28,780
people you need to have your HTTP active

740
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:31,750
and the webserver and then you need to

741
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:33,670
create a certificate I had introduced a

742
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:35,350
mini Timo but I'm not going to run

743
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:39,160
through it I'm going to share this

744
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:50,520
document with you you can do this at

745
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:55,839
home and I've brought my next cloud and

746
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:59,380
how does it work I can connect myself I

747
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:02,650
sell like client bootie and I start

748
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:06,760
executing the commands so steps and with

749
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:09,730
these are 12 steps I can update the next

750
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:12,430
route you install a party you install

751
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:15,940
about two libraries to connect it with a

752
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:19,359
case speed in this case version seven we

753
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:23,140
install my crib imagine all these

754
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:25,990
requirements that the next cloud

755
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:30,180
libraries need in order to be able to

756
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:30,180
view a content than I install

757
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:44,120
the software I update it

758
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:49,810
I am so the database here it is and then

759
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:52,549
I use a mind secure security

760
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:55,279
installation that basically asks us the

761
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:59,240
set of questions so that we can harden

762
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:02,060
the database for example that the heart

763
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:09,350
and the database only accept connections

764
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:12,320
from X to Y for a specific range and we

765
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:17,560
don't need to listen everybody through

766
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:23,300
port 3 and 6 3 and be on the lookout for

767
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:25,820
good for us a taxi you can see that the

768
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:29,690
database Maria Devi is duly installed

769
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:32,770
and we can see secure installation and

770
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:37,730
we can enhance the security level of the

771
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:39,920
database I install next cloud version 11

772
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,360
there's version 12 available but we went

773
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:47,180
for version 11

774
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:50,930
then we D confess we unzip and then we

775
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:54,169
add a virtual host to the Apache and

776
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:57,710
with that we enter the IP ofor server or

777
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:59,360
the domain name / next cloud and

778
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:02,000
automatically we receive the

779
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:06,050
installation panel in this case we need

780
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:11,120
to enter our username updated - name of

781
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:13,640
the database and and step 8 as you can

782
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:18,880
see the database is created in this case

783
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:21,890
the database it's called next our DB the

784
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:24,860
user is next I'll slash you sure and you

785
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:27,830
can enter whatever password you wish so

786
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:31,150
with command 8-week EK the database when

787
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:34,670
you access you will provide those

788
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:38,110
details and you'll be able to use next

789
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:38,110
clad with no problem what

790
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:46,070
let's move on

791
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:48,620
this is the magic cheat sheet that I

792
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:54,470
mentioned and I'll shared with you in

793
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:56,569
some minutes okay we're going to create

794
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:58,129
the cloud we still haven't seen the

795
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,200
cloud right at the cloud I've been

796
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:01,580
talking about for an hour already let's

797
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:11,779
take a look at the cloud

798
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:15,590
here it is so you can use your tablets

799
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:18,260
to connect to the cloud you can access

800
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:20,500
it this is the cloud we prepared here

801
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:24,860
you can see the interface I'm going to

802
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:27,020
log through DC cat and admin that will

803
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,640
be my username on Parvati with a

804
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,150
username so that you can do this

805
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,150
yourself

806
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:45,790
so that's wait a second maybe was open

807
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:48,800
and the session has expired

808
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:51,590
okay here you can see the interface of

809
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,630
this class I like to explain to you what

810
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:57,020
you're going to find in this interface

811
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:58,730
first let's begin with the options

812
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:03,110
available to the user

813
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:05,090
here we go to personal here you'll have

814
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:09,050
the option of introducing your name

815
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:11,660
email address our email will send us

816
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:14,210
info we can ask the cloud to send us

817
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,250
info on the activity in our account if

818
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:19,130
someone accesses with our account the

819
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:21,920
cloud will send us a summary of the

820
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:25,460
activity of that account and we will

821
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,860
know what is happening with our data we

822
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:31,970
can set it with a profile we can even

823
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:34,460
upload a photo that come in sloka for

824
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:39,319
this year we can define groups in this

825
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:41,450
case the US and men the user has the

826
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,550
authorization to administer we can

827
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,439
change the password we can select the

828
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:46,940
language say for example in our company

829
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,560
we have people that feel more

830
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:52,820
comfortable speaking German and Italian

831
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:57,529
or whatever in English we can for those

832
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:59,690
specific users well so like a specific

833
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:02,270
language for the interface and what's

834
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:05,030
most interesting here are of course the

835
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:08,570
customers of case we have access to a

836
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:11,060
web interface and here we have clients

837
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:14,000
for Windows for Linux for Android and

838
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:16,220
for iOS that's the most interesting

839
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,060
thing from a mobile device I can

840
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:26,500
interact with the data I have in the

841
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:30,080
cloud as you can see I obtain info on

842
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:34,460
sessions I can enter passwords for apps

843
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:39,890
I can download one of the customers and

844
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:41,960
say you will only be able to access this

845
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:45,350
device with this password and if it's

846
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:49,400
another device well access cannot be

847
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:52,700
gained here you can see the backlog of

848
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:56,600
activities the user has created a new

849
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:58,970
folder we can tell the system to report

850
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:02,569
on activities to send us an email

851
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:04,700
whenever a folder has been shared and a

852
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:09,020
file has been shared from another server

853
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:12,020
we can specify what events we want to be

854
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:13,790
informed on via email and also the

855
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:16,820
frequency with which we want to receive

856
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:19,100
these emails for example send every hour

857
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:21,560
or on a weekly basis if we're doing the

858
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:24,290
Wonder cloud to become a spammer this is

859
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:26,240
bombards us with emails we can tell the

860
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:28,730
system to send us emails on a weekly

861
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,140
basis here we have a part of music where

862
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:38,710
we can define a folder for music

863
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:40,930
in order to enable the well music and

864
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:43,120
then we have this so-called federated

865
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:44,830
cloud this is also interested in because

866
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,930
everybody has its own cloud these days

867
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:49,930
so we can interact with other clouds

868
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:51,790
with other next class these sir and

869
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:55,270
trust-based relationships that allow us

870
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:58,540
to access other clouds this is what we

871
00:55:55,270 --> 00:56:04,420
understand by federated across and as a

872
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:07,060
hardening before so enabled two-factor

873
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:08,860
authentication option for this user it's

874
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,320
not enabled I have it for another one

875
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:15,190
that I'll show you soon and we can do a

876
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:17,830
two digit authentication and this

877
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:20,920
provides even greater security to our

878
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:25,600
cloud so here you have the options the

879
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:29,500
user could so that's what I wanted to

880
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:33,069
say regarding the users settings and now

881
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:35,230
going to move fund personal details

882
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:38,620
sessions have already covered base let's

883
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:42,580
move on to files okay here we will have

884
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:44,680
all the files all the fossil bed

885
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:48,970
particularly user in this case he has a

886
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:53,830
folder with pictures some sample

887
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:55,810
pictures and we will be able to view

888
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:58,180
these pictures in a real-time basis

889
00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:04,960
everything can be viewed in the form of

890
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:07,089
a gallery of images or it's a list and

891
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,340
that's what I want to say regarding that

892
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:15,930
photographs we can also have a work in

893
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:15,930
folders document folders videos as well

894
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:22,420
we can retest in PDF format without

895
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,640
having to download them we hit the PDF

896
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:28,359
and we're able to view the content of

897
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,900
the PDF I don't know if I'm using BPM or

898
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:32,740
not

899
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:34,960
yes apparently the transfer is by Avi

900
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:38,500
p.m. I'm connecting myself to Seville

901
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:40,990
and you know this is a form of secure

902
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:43,390
connection and here you can see a PDF

903
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:46,240
file in real time basis you can read it

904
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:49,269
on your own device or devices when the

905
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:53,649
user connects there's some handbook that

906
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:56,649
explains how next cloud is used what

907
00:57:53,650 --> 00:58:01,140
else can I say what else can I show you

908
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:05,200
this recording file now let's move on

909
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:07,000
well as files what's the most

910
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,089
interesting part of files here we have a

911
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,089
many different options so first let's

912
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:14,950
take a look at the pictures of the food

913
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:17,799
we can view the details there's some

914
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:19,868
interesting app for forensic computing

915
00:58:17,799 --> 00:58:23,440
purposes which is the ability to view

916
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:26,259
made of data I'm going to select or

917
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,019
click on metadata and I can view the

918
00:58:26,259 --> 00:58:31,990
metadata for that specific picture date

919
00:58:29,019 --> 00:58:35,439
of creation all the data pertaining to

920
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:40,808
this specific picture what are the owner

921
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:45,130
etc this document or this picture I can

922
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:49,779
share it I can label it speaking about

923
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:52,059
the date whether it's holidays and I can

924
00:58:49,779 --> 00:58:54,460
add comments and what is more

925
00:58:52,059 --> 00:58:59,819
interesting in addition to my own cloud

926
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:59,819
is the fact of being able to share it I

927
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:12,340
would share it here I can generate

928
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:17,710
I can share by users or groups or I can

929
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:21,430
create a link if I share this photograph

930
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:23,530
with link anyone that can see the link

931
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:26,980
can see the photograph but it can also

932
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:30,040
be protected with a password and this

933
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:40,690
adds a higher level of privacy and we

934
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:44,920
also include maturity date when we see

935
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:50,500
the files we can see our favorites those

936
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:53,080
that have been shared I can those files

937
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:56,560
that I have shared with other users and

938
00:59:53,080 --> 01:00:02,580
the possibility to share with other

939
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:11,380
users we can see our accounts activity

940
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:15,900
what we've done what did I do the other

941
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:21,400
where are my favorite files shared files

942
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:24,240
comments and in a single in an

943
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:29,470
institution as a university or a company

944
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:33,368
we can collaborate with our files this

945
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:36,209
is the gallery now contacts contacts is

946
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:40,450
empty here there are programs to

947
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:42,090
synchronize with iOS devices but there

948
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:45,930
are also external programs that allow

949
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:50,020
contacts synchronization with Outlook I

950
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:57,359
can import all my Outlook contacts to

951
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:57,359
the cloud or I can add them manually

952
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:08,210
here I can define we can play if I have

953
01:01:05,059 --> 01:01:11,750
an audio I can add notes that are in the

954
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:14,650
cloud or add more applications and here

955
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:17,690
there's a whole new world each user can

956
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:21,619
define the type of applications that

957
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:24,559
want to activate in their cloud look at

958
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:27,920
all the possibilities authentication and

959
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:31,819
authorization personalization game

960
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:36,109
integration monitoring office text it

961
01:01:31,819 --> 01:01:45,460
will be impossible to see them all you

962
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:51,049
connect now you can't see your preferred

963
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:55,730
choice for your clouds video player

964
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:59,480
online collaboration services to view

965
01:01:55,730 --> 01:02:01,339
meta data some are activated by default

966
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:05,200
although you can activate or deactivate

967
01:02:01,339 --> 01:02:05,200
them according to your interest

968
01:02:07,089 --> 01:02:15,828
there are also dual authentication there

969
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:17,950
are not many games in this case but this

970
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:24,410
is the most interesting part the

971
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:27,788
applications once we have our cloud as I

972
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:31,700
said before we need a certificate today

973
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:34,420
browsers sanction us and make compulsory

974
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:37,220
to have a certification in a website

975
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:41,180
whether personal corporate there are

976
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:43,819
certificates of all prices 300 350 euros

977
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:46,118
those that just have the name of the

978
01:02:43,819 --> 01:02:49,549
company's name in green and then the

979
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:54,619
domain name and there are also some more

980
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:59,000
economical from 30 to 40 here 30 to 40

981
01:02:54,619 --> 01:03:01,190
euros but let's encrypt is free we don't

982
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,859
have to pay for the certificate that's

983
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:06,670
the benefit that is for free but as a

984
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:09,589
drawback this certificate

985
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:12,319
terminates every three months but just

986
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:14,959
with a small script there is an update

987
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:17,089
every two months or every three months

988
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:21,379
and we forget about the security

989
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:25,209
certificate now in our cloud we're using

990
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:30,339
a letter script let's encrypt

991
01:03:25,209 --> 01:03:35,379
certificate this is just a small demo

992
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:38,808
I'm sorry if you cannot see it very well

993
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:41,779
this is information about how to create

994
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:46,219
security certificates now we're just

995
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:50,869
updating then winds to the server that

996
01:03:46,219 --> 01:03:53,959
will bring about the certificate we add

997
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:57,170
the sir would repository that will

998
01:03:53,959 --> 01:04:07,190
generate the certificate is gonna be on

999
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:10,640
our as a key so we see the update in the

1000
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:13,969
repository and then I installed Python

1001
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:18,949
sir good aparte those videos are in the

1002
01:04:13,969 --> 01:04:22,130
net in the cloud you will now see test

1003
01:04:18,949 --> 01:04:26,089
thousands of characters moving it

1004
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:33,559
installs all pythons libraries and once

1005
01:04:26,089 --> 01:04:36,279
I do this I clean the screen until the

1006
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:36,279
screen and

1007
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:48,080
I launched the let's encrypt certificate

1008
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:50,089
I use an away message to speak about the

1009
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:55,850
certificate maturity the type of

1010
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:58,340
certificate using HTTPS I will say that

1011
01:04:55,850 --> 01:05:03,980
I will install it with a part do you

1012
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:08,150
concede in the cloud yourselves and then

1013
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:13,160
the certificate will be generated our

1014
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:20,350
created here the domain is an authority

1015
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:23,210
s then I go on answering about the

1016
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:27,410
available sites and I give instructions

1017
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:29,260
about the route in the dirt world place

1018
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:34,009
that I've defined here you see the

1019
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:36,740
certificate and I see that the

1020
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:39,700
certificate of just unloaded will be in

1021
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:43,129
this route and I'll indicate there but

1022
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:51,140
to locate it in a specific place

1023
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:56,840
I just reboot to see if everything has

1024
01:05:51,140 --> 01:06:00,279
worked so it's quite easy to create h TT

1025
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:03,320
PS certificate only takes three minutes

1026
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:06,290
to create a certificate and we can avoid

1027
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:10,010
many problems if you are at a hotel or

1028
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:15,860
restaurant with a public with Wi-Fi and

1029
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:19,280
if you do not use HTTPS you will be

1030
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:25,700
sharing your passwords with all those

1031
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:28,730
that are that time aspyn your website so

1032
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:31,910
here we are adding to Chrome the

1033
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:35,930
updating period every 2 or 3 months for

1034
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:37,940
an automatic renewal of certificates and

1035
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:41,470
as I said that I will share this with

1036
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:45,020
you so that you can

1037
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:50,270
take it later and I've got the checklist

1038
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:53,059
with all the necessary steps we already

1039
01:06:50,270 --> 01:07:02,509
have the certificate what is the quality

1040
01:06:53,059 --> 01:07:09,710
of this HTTPS D certificate this

1041
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:11,240
certificate is a a+ level that means is

1042
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:13,880
good quality a very good quality

1043
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:17,899
certificate all browsers will

1044
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:22,250
acknowledge it is not going we're not

1045
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:25,250
going to have the HTT P as with a Red

1046
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:29,329
Cross and as I say you can check the

1047
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:33,020
quality of your certificate certificates

1048
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:35,089
of 25 euros are really basic if we want

1049
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:39,529
a more professional one we might have to

1050
01:07:35,089 --> 01:07:43,549
pay more every year in this way you can

1051
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:46,369
have a very good quality certificate

1052
01:07:43,549 --> 01:07:49,240
that is automatically renew every two or

1053
01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:57,289
three months we have our cloud with

1054
01:07:49,240 --> 01:08:00,680
HTTPS and it's now the time to use it if

1055
01:07:57,289 --> 01:08:06,760
you have cell phones smart phones we can

1056
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:11,750
get in in CV soluciones and cloud dot

1057
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:16,609
yes and here you have the user and the

1058
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:22,330
password and because you're several here

1059
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:28,130
in the room after it user 1 user 2 and

1060
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:32,000
each of you can access to those users

1061
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:35,750
you can change the password and just use

1062
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,969
it if I go to user management you will

1063
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:40,729
see how easy it is here there's a list

1064
01:08:37,969 --> 01:08:44,420
of all the users

1065
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:48,410
created user 1 user 2 password for user

1066
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:54,190
1 is user that one user number 2 is user

1067
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:59,029
dot tail used 2.3 and so on and so forth

1068
01:08:54,189 --> 01:09:01,450
I've created an in civic group also so

1069
01:08:59,029 --> 01:09:05,479
that we can play with a group

1070
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:12,439
possibilities I define the group in

1071
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:19,879
theory in this case with user 7 the

1072
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:25,069
password also area that 7 it takes just

1073
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:34,819
a little second so the person that looks

1074
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:39,740
in with user 7 just type in in CVS

1075
01:09:34,819 --> 01:09:46,359
soluciones and cloud dot yes they can

1076
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:46,359
just login user 7 in this case

1077
01:09:50,180 --> 01:10:03,050
and you didn't tell me that there was a

1078
01:09:56,489 --> 01:10:03,049
missing a here and then we can log-in

1079
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:10,350
we login and we can automatically access

1080
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:14,520
to our cloud when we access for the

1081
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:20,489
first time there will be a helper that

1082
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:22,980
offers to install the client this was

1083
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:26,519
not the case this time but this is the

1084
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:31,739
folder by default what is the storage

1085
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:35,580
capacity for user 1 of a user 7 is given

1086
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:38,400
by the admin by default and mean create

1087
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:41,070
unlimited ones but it might want to

1088
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:51,150
limit it I will give my users 15

1089
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:56,159
gigabytes 15 15 GB this is what you have

1090
01:10:51,150 --> 01:11:01,620
to type and I can administer the space

1091
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:04,980
you can create organizational units this

1092
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:09,140
is language windows certain energy we

1093
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:12,769
can create group works by projects by

1094
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:15,870
topics and all documents can be shared

1095
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:18,090
among the group work instead of sharing

1096
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:22,080
with a specific person you can share

1097
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:29,019
with the whole group let us do just a

1098
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:34,459
small practical example I am

1099
01:11:29,019 --> 01:11:40,639
ii mean users I'm going to my files

1100
01:11:34,459 --> 01:11:47,139
directory in files i will go to

1101
01:11:40,639 --> 01:11:57,349
documents and then I will upload certain

1102
01:11:47,139 --> 01:12:01,329
files I go to my desktop and I have the

1103
01:11:57,349 --> 01:12:04,159
checklist of the script and I

1104
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:08,209
automatically upload them to the cloud

1105
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:17,539
and now I'm going to share them so I say

1106
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:27,709
I want to share I want to share with a

1107
01:12:17,539 --> 01:12:29,869
group ok i sir within thievius group but

1108
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:34,039
if i want to share it through a link i

1109
01:12:29,869 --> 01:12:37,039
can generate the link otherwise i share

1110
01:12:34,039 --> 01:12:39,679
it with an internal group if this person

1111
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:44,268
or group is in the cloud the only thing

1112
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:46,940
i have to do is to type the name of the

1113
01:12:44,269 --> 01:12:49,940
person if it's outside the cloud i send

1114
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:56,268
a link with or without a password so i

1115
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:59,768
can share all of this information these

1116
01:12:56,269 --> 01:12:59,769
about documents

1117
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:12,500
let us try now have you are you in have

1118
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:18,290

some compartir do well so we seem to

1124
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:49,519
have a problem here let us do it again

1125
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,620
what I said you know that yellow-eyed

1126

and now I know whether I can edit it or

1133
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:30,749

1136
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:37,650
gonna be up and running for the whole

1137
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:41,630
weekend be aware of what do you upload

1138
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:44,089
to the cloud but you're very welcome to

1139
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:49,499
use it

1140
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:51,989
why no I got CCO now this is just a

1141
01:14:49,499 --> 01:14:55,110
small exercise if you are now logged

1142
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:59,280
into the cloud just take a picture or

1143
01:14:55,110 --> 01:15:02,280
look from your gallery and just upload

1144
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:05,369
to the cloud and you share it so we see

1145
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:08,699
the response at times how long does it

1146
01:15:05,369 --> 01:15:12,089
take to upload a file and how easy it is

1147
01:15:08,699 --> 01:15:15,388
to share it with this system there are

1148
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:18,030
two ways to share it through the website

1149
01:15:15,389 --> 01:15:20,159
or you can download the client there's a

1150
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:22,679
client for Android that can be

1151
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:26,909
downloaded from Google Play if you have

1152
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:30,829
an iOS you can install it in the highest

1153
01:15:26,909 --> 01:15:34,110
repositories and you can check it

1154
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:37,938
yourselves also when we post I will let

1155
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:37,938
you know a few seconds to do so

1156
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:02,050
see come okay that also we roll our or

1157
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:15,580
what is the error when logging in okay I

1158
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:19,660
will check it with you bian que pasa

1159
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:24,190
what happens how does the client work in

1160
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:25,059
Windows let us have a look that was

1161
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:30,309
sweet

1162
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:33,190
while you are blowed photograph I'm

1163
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:42,720
gonna change into another session to see

1164
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:42,719
the client let us go to this device now

1165
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:57,080
let us install the client for Windows to

1166
01:16:52,219 --> 01:17:02,000
see all functionalities here we have the

1167
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:16,070
execute once we connect to the net we

1168
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:18,830
executed was a yes the next one the

1169
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:25,750
install the direct access through a

1170
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:35,000
circuit it starts the installing process

1171
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:39,320
installing process and executed as I

1172
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:45,460
said before we see the link the execute

1173
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:45,460
is taking some more time this

1174
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:55,809
just I'm going to close the previous

1175
01:17:49,969 --> 01:18:01,790
session I will login again the first

1176
01:17:55,809 --> 01:18:06,099
information requested is to introduce

1177
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:11,989
the URL if it's the first things time

1178
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:17,710
you should add HTTPS in fever dot yes

1179
01:18:11,989 --> 01:18:27,799
and then it would request user and ID

1180
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:30,460
user ID and password the problem would

1181
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,460
be here

1182
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:45,700
here we have let us see the settings

1183
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:48,850
important things the we will go through

1184
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:51,639
proxy or through an open network usually

1185
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:54,880
we're gonna do it without proxy and

1186
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:59,260
something important the bandwidth we can

1187
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:02,920
say how much it's going to use for the

1188
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:06,220
uploads and for the download for the

1189
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:08,320
turn loud we don't want to limit it but

1190
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:10,120
for the upload if is not with a

1191
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:15,549
symmetric network we can say for

1192
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:19,599
uploading limit it to a megabyte for

1193
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:25,090
example per seconds or we can leave it

1194
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:28,510
open it depends on your network what

1195
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:32,650
about the settings general settings you

1196
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:36,100
can execute the client when you log into

1197
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:40,990
the system for synchronizing you can

1198
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:45,990
decide on what files to be ignore for

1199
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:51,519
example Linux OS or some photographic

1200
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:56,769
files or theorems and maybe those large

1201
01:19:51,520 --> 01:20:01,900
files I want them to be ignored not to

1202
01:19:56,770 --> 01:20:04,690
use so much bandwidth when you install

1203
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:07,210
the client they will ask about the

1204
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:11,559
folder you want to synchronize this is

1205
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:15,850
key if a folder that is documents inside

1206
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:18,970
the user this folder has a data do you

1207
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:22,630
want me to erase it or to synchronize it

1208
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:24,790
and you can choose to synchronize them

1209
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:28,320
so everything is uploaded and I know as

1210
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:31,260
in Dropbox that I will have a folder

1211
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:33,549
where there will be an ongoing

1212
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:34,960
synchronization of everything I add in

1213
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:37,360
to this folder and this is

1214
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:42,700
the interesting but if you're gonna use

1215
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:47,679
it for light text documents this is

1216
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:50,920
almost the instant for bandwidth reasons

1217
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:58,120
I had stopped it it was in pause but I

1218
01:20:50,920 --> 01:21:00,850
can press Continue the translation is

1219
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:05,730
not very good is to continuous

1220
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:12,480
synchronization and it will start the

1221
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:17,559
synchronizing period with my computer

1222
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:21,190
remember that those files in my net

1223
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:25,870
cloud I can see the previous version of

1224
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:30,839
all my files here is a historic of what

1225
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:35,130
I had been doing during the last 11

1226
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:41,020
hours here we have the activity log of

1227
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:43,600
my user and here we have the folder

1228
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:46,060
after later in the folder another folder

1229
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,580
the name is the cloud that is

1230
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:51,690
synchronizing everything I have in my

1231
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:51,690
user folder

1232
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:11,390
I cannot find it now we will do it now

1233
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:27,390
you need C users and in theory he had to

1234
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:33,929
be here in my documents but here as in

1235
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:36,540
Dropbox we have the sank icon and I see

1236
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:39,840
that all the documents are kept in the

1237
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:43,530
cloud are synchronized with my computer

1238
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:47,040
I know that this is useful as a backup

1239
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:50,400
and I can automatically uploaded to the

1240
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:52,640
cloud worrisome Green is between is in

1241
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:57,210
synchronization process and the rest

1242
01:22:52,640 --> 01:23:00,770
will be synchronized later the cloud is

1243
01:22:57,210 --> 01:23:05,190
now up and working it first security

1244
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:07,580
HTTP is quite an interesting cloud then

1245
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:11,160
it depends on the bandwidth my

1246
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:15,420
connection is using a UPN so is not only

1247
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:19,139
using this network the channel is

1248
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:22,290
encapsulated up to my office and then to

1249
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:25,440
the URL that's why the times are a

1250
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:28,670
little bit slower

1251
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,669
[Music]

1252
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:51,860
bueno pues estamos aqui here we are and

1253
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:57,019
now we are going to fill our cloud we

1254
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:59,420
can use a hard disk we can connect it

1255
01:23:57,020 --> 01:24:01,850
for those that have Google Drive through

1256
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:07,910
an API we can connect it to Google Drive

1257
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:14,590
and we can synchronize it and what is

1258
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:17,570
also very interesting is to activate in

1259
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:22,340
applications the external storage

1260
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:24,740
support it allows me to connect to other

1261
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:28,400
devices that I might have at home and

1262
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:32,559
here you see the different protocols you

1263
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:37,639
can fill your cloud connecting it to

1264
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:43,310
Dropbox to another net or unclouded to a

1265
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:45,410
web app to samba or sip so if I have a

1266
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:50,870
free nurse the raziel in your system

1267
01:24:45,410 --> 01:24:55,760
that allow us to reuse all devices well

1268
01:24:50,870 --> 01:25:01,340
we can use these computers and us with

1269
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:04,460
server I can share or access all those

1270
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:06,680
hard drives and storage capacity using

1271
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:09,200
those protocols obviously is going to be

1272
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:12,650
as low it's not the same a disconnected

1273
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:15,530
to this that when you go through FTP

1274
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:18,950
protocol or cable using different

1275
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:20,670
connections you can always improve it

1276
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:22,800
through a gigabytes

1277
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:27,180
network or through fiber external

1278
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:32,640
storage will allow to give more space to

1279
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:37,050
our cloud and we can also enlarge our

1280
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:44,820
cloud using another net cloud the cloud

1281
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:48,980
can be scalable in this a slider is big

1282
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:53,670
about adding external storage capacity

1283
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:59,910
if we go back to our cloud now and I

1284
01:25:53,670 --> 01:26:02,220
will teach you now the following let's

1285
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:07,800
see if you can help me we go to

1286
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:10,590
applications it's not active now you can

1287
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:13,670
see it here external storage support I

1288
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:13,670
activate it

1289
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:30,270
and now we activate it for all users

1290
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:33,080
once is activated if I go to a user to

1291
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:33,080
this user for example

1292
01:26:41,650 --> 01:26:54,580
and we now go to our personal folder

1293
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:07,800
let's see if I can see it now which is

1294
01:27:02,679 --> 01:27:07,800
not the case right now

1295
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:14,500
and so on

1296
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:35,140
mother Danny acne de la Luz Wario okay

1297
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:38,410
here we have the user it's in the

1298
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:42,940
personal area external storage I don't

1299
01:27:38,410 --> 01:27:49,900
know why it isn't working well

1300
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:54,210
apparently it is enabled otherwise like

1301
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:54,210
an exit and login again I say user

1302
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:23,560
don't look at DNA so I would see the

1303
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:28,719
external storage part here it is

1304
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:32,460
sorry my mistake I would have to set up

1305
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:44,650
the external storage so I should go to

1306
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:47,670
personal settings I can't find it not I

1307
01:28:44,650 --> 01:28:47,670
can't find it

1308
01:28:55,290 --> 01:29:06,280
I would have to do this before at the

1309
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:09,390
user area here we have a user

1310
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,389
[Music]

1311
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:22,799
[Music]

1312
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:33,410
let me see if I can find it otherwise I

1313
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:33,410
should exit and enter again so I could

1314
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:41,639
tell the program with what device they

1315
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:46,820
wish to connait FTTP

1316
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:46,820
a dry Amazon device

1317
01:29:51,700 --> 01:30:02,720
external storage I don't know why I

1318
01:29:57,610 --> 01:30:04,580
can't see how I can set this up and I

1319
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:07,690
want I don't want to take too much of

1320
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,690
your time with this

1321
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:18,260
external storage again well here it is

1322
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:27,049
under storage

1323
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:32,620
I can select choose the type of storage

1324
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:36,790
for example of TPP another next clouds

1325
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:39,980
the local level and once this is defined

1326
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:45,320
two users could view this sorry for that

1327
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:47,690
I couldn't find my way around an admin I

1328
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:53,240
can choose the type of storage in order

1329
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:55,519
to be able to expand bring fees rather

1330
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:59,570
the size of the cloud you can choose

1331
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:03,110
whatever system you wish for example FST

1332
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:05,679
P as yet another option among which you

1333
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:05,679
can choose

1334
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:15,969
open stand optics Amazon here are

1335
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:17,680
several options available another

1336
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:21,940
interesting thing that I like to

1337
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:24,300
highlight is that when you do the

1338
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:28,469
hardening of the cloud you have the

1339
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:32,350
possibility of doing a two digit

1340
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:40,260
authentication you wish to enable this

1341
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:47,080
you need to download an app totp and

1342
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:50,440
Android it's called VT OTP so this means

1343
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:57,970
that as administrators and this is very

1344
01:31:50,440 --> 01:32:02,200
easy to do as administrators you should

1345
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:03,880
access the applications area I can also

1346
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:05,889
well actually a user can also enable

1347
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:10,780
there's no one that I think about it

1348
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:13,740
then you go to security and this case is

1349
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:18,099
so already installed two digit

1350
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:21,760
authentication in this case we decided

1351
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:25,990
to choose the totp system so once we

1352
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:28,260
have it we go to the user this specific

1353
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:28,260
user

1354
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:32,590
[Music]

1355
01:32:30,870 --> 01:32:35,019
yes

1356
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:38,260
if you go to the personal area you

1357
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:43,239
scroll down and the lower part you will

1358
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:48,340
see the option enabled totp for two

1359
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:52,239
digit authentication so a QR code is

1360
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:54,280
automatically generator and with our

1361
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:57,330
mobile phones we would have to download

1362
01:32:54,280 --> 01:33:00,340
the application here it is

1363
01:32:57,330 --> 01:33:03,519
and once we install it and download it

1364
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:05,739
and our mobile phones we scan with our

1365
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:13,150
mobile phone the QR code generated by

1366
01:33:05,739 --> 01:33:17,290
the user here it is this QR code is um

1367
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:19,960
synchronized I'll show you why pull well

1368
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:22,060
I like to be the camera so that you see

1369
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:24,940
how this two-factor authentication works

1370
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:29,650
and it's always interesting to generate

1371
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:32,559
it back up coats in case for example

1372
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:33,879
there is this synchronization or in case

1373
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:36,550
we don't have the mobile there are some

1374
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:39,969
fixed codes that can of enable us to

1375
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:43,239
gain access to the platform these codes

1376
01:33:39,969 --> 01:33:46,510
need to be copied and stored just in

1377
01:33:43,239 --> 01:33:50,440
case how does this two factor

1378
01:33:46,510 --> 01:33:53,920
authentication work let's take a look at

1379
01:33:50,440 --> 01:34:01,440
an example I'm going to select another

1380
01:33:53,920 --> 01:34:01,440
user either yen I and true the password

1381
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:12,349
I start new session and now I'm asked to

1382
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:17,929
introduce an authentication code this

1383
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:24,320
code let me activate the camera uncover

1384
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:27,320
it rather no and I'm going to show you

1385
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:32,809
how this is done I hope nobody calls me

1386
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:39,980
nor messages me at this moment and here

1387
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:42,530
you can see this icon and this is going

1388
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:45,290
to automatically generate I know that

1389
01:34:42,530 --> 01:34:48,280
you're seeing this as a mirror but this

1390
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:51,769
will generate a code as soon as I click

1391
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:54,410
on the link and a code as you can see

1392
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:56,660
it's created can you see it now in this

1393
01:34:54,410 --> 01:35:02,599
code will last me a little so I have

1394
01:34:56,660 --> 01:35:07,730
this time to enter the code s and I can

1395
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:12,190
access directly so have someone steals

1396
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:12,190
my password

1397
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:20,480
well that person will need to introduce

1398
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:25,780
the second authentication in order to

1399
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:25,780
access my data what's interesting

1400
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:34,630
well I'm going to remind you how videos

1401
01:35:30,970 --> 01:35:39,250
are shared I trashed share select the

1402
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:42,490
group cyber group and I share the videos

1403
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:44,890
of this presentation I say whether I

1404
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:52,300
stop differ on whether the videos can be

1405
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:57,820
downloaded edited or only viewed etc and

1406
01:35:52,300 --> 01:36:03,850
here I also have music now with VPN I'll

1407
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:06,250
take a bit longer the files can be

1408
01:36:03,850 --> 01:36:08,560
viewed in a real-time on a real-time

1409
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:12,070
basis but for music you need to download

1410
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:17,140
it and once download it you can start

1411
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:19,690
reproducing it we're doing this through

1412
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:23,500
the BPM and that's why in the download

1413
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:25,679
ties are slower I know if it's playing

1414
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:25,680
or not

1415
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:47,369
apparently the volume is very low it

1416
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:52,650
takes very little time to reproduce

1417
01:36:47,369 --> 01:36:58,339
music okay probably music isn't being

1418
01:36:52,650 --> 01:37:02,610
played should be and take some seconds

1419
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:05,300
and this would allow you to listen to

1420
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:11,059
the music and your music repository

1421
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:15,810
let's move on here you have an example

1422
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:17,099
this be OTP is a dull or two-factor

1423
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:20,520
authentication for many applications

1424
01:37:17,099 --> 01:37:24,389
that only are cloud everywhere Evernote

1425
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:27,150
Google Facebook you can use it for other

1426
01:37:24,389 --> 01:37:29,150
things it's pretty easy to use they're

1427
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:32,579
pretty intuitive or user friendly

1428
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:38,629
remember to generate emergency keys that

1429
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:41,309
are fixed keys or passwords tips for you

1430
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:43,710
it's always important to place a

1431
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:47,909
firewall in fond of the clouds we

1432
01:37:43,710 --> 01:37:52,260
decided to go for a pee sensor in order

1433
01:37:47,909 --> 01:37:54,570
to protect the cloud infrastructure if

1434
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:57,270
we don't have a firewall you need to

1435
01:37:54,570 --> 01:38:03,230
remember that we're using Linux so you

1436
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:07,320
we can use the IP tablets and Linux

1437
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:12,178
we need to deny everything and only open

1438
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:15,929
the necessary ports another option ports

1439
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:20,099
for filtering when we install is a can

1440
01:38:15,929 --> 01:38:23,280
we connect we can either change the port

1441
01:38:20,099 --> 01:38:26,639
and aside from changing the port we can

1442
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:29,309
say I will only accept requests from

1443
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:34,889
this IP which is the only app you can

1444
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:37,590
use to interact with this server you

1445
01:38:34,889 --> 01:38:40,199
need to understand that by default it's

1446
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:45,870
in HTTP but I will have the possibility

1447
01:38:40,199 --> 01:38:47,820
of generating HTTPS by generating

1448
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:51,120
difficut we've seen an example of how we

1449
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:58,049
can generate a certificate that can be

1450
01:38:51,120 --> 01:39:03,450
seen in green and I need a 443 port open

1451
01:38:58,050 --> 01:39:06,540
for HTTP as the user can view at all

1452
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:10,800
times what is being done with his

1453
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:16,560
account latest events in his account

1454
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:18,030
data to stuff security has to be enabled

1455
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,380
and it's important to have a backup

1456
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:21,690
Picard

1457
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:25,770
and once we've implemented these

1458
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:29,820
measures this cloud could fly so to say

1459
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:33,380
but for it to fly in a safe and secure

1460
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:39,389
manner we would have to add yet another

1461
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:43,640
layer what I call a VPN varnish and that

1462
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:43,640
makes me to you how I do this

1463
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:59,880
in this case I have a more industrial

1464
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:59,880
virtualization system

1465
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:11,200
so

1466
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:43,650
this case I have a server that server

1467
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:45,900
with virtual machines six virtual

1468
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:50,429
machines for different uses or purposes

1469
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:53,339
and one next cloud

1470
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:56,250
this next crowd here is using an

1471
01:40:53,340 --> 01:41:01,320
external IP which is the one you enter

1472
01:40:56,250 --> 01:41:03,960
you de verdad soluciones and this key

1473
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:05,519
for VPN that I would setup would be as

1474
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:12,420
follows here you can see that a machine

1475
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:17,160
is a farvel it's a PF sense and and I

1476
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:20,229
have a Windows 7 to manage pfSense and

1477
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:20,229
[Music]

1478
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:30,330
this is a Linux machine with two network

1479
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:33,000
interfaces this feed OSD and what it

1480
01:41:30,330 --> 01:41:40,559
does with two network interfaces to have

1481
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:42,830
an external port opened and an external

1482
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:46,410
IP and all traffic generated is

1483
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:49,350
transformed into an IP internal IEP so

1484
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:55,110
Windows 7 that I have here has an

1485
01:41:49,350 --> 01:42:00,120
internal IP that you will see here to

1486
01:41:55,110 --> 01:42:03,059
network interfaces one internal IP which

1487
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:05,099
is where you connect to Windows seven

1488
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:08,880
how would I set up this infrastructure I

1489
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:11,550
will set up a firewall it with an

1490
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:14,490
external and an internal IP and the next

1491
01:42:11,550 --> 01:42:19,860
cloud would be assembled or said with an

1492
01:42:14,490 --> 01:42:24,210
interface connected to an internal IP to

1493
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:28,200
an intranet that is so by doing this I'm

1494
01:42:24,210 --> 01:42:31,650
the shrink that when I set up a VPN that

1495
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:32,970
vpm is secure and therefore that next

1496
01:42:31,650 --> 01:42:37,469
thought is not

1497
01:42:32,970 --> 01:42:41,760
supposed to deface man food forest

1498
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:44,480
attacks and for the sake of time I've

1499
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:51,480
brought you some videos that explain how

1500
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:54,959
we set the VPN to do this VPN I would

1501
01:42:51,480 --> 01:43:01,169
use Open VPN which is a free software

1502
01:42:54,960 --> 01:43:04,560
and it's being done on pfSense so you

1503
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:08,100
can install this also in Linux even in

1504
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:15,480
the same net next up what we do is

1505
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:19,560
create a VPN the certificate we specify

1506
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:24,209
our company indicate country province

1507
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:28,170
etc we enter all this info I'm going to

1508
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:33,770
enter some video here which is where it

1509
01:43:28,170 --> 01:43:33,770
comes from and I fill this with the data

1510
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:49,799
my company and email address of whatever

1511
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:54,360
company I specify the company and

1512
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:59,910
generate a certificate and once we have

1513
01:43:54,360 --> 01:44:03,990
a certificate I can add a user I wish

1514
01:43:59,910 --> 01:44:09,710
and that's hard to beat in a PF sense in

1515
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:09,710
this case BPM user the password

1516
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:22,980
I can create several users with a

1517
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:26,480
certificate and neech's recognizes our

1518
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:29,190
own certificate and with the VPN does

1519
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:30,209
for an external network is create a

1520
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:34,950
tunnel

1521
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:37,260
thus a funnel towards an Internet and to

1522
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:38,010
manage this as if we were in the

1523
01:44:37,260 --> 01:44:43,170
Internet

1524
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:46,580
once we grade that you sir what we can

1525
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:46,580
do directly

1526
01:44:56,710 --> 01:45:07,120
we go to an assistant a wizard whether

1527
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:11,420
we generate a certificate for that

1528
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:20,559
specific user there you have the

1529
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:26,510
description part we've made a

1530
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:29,960
certificate and once created the default

1531
01:45:26,510 --> 01:45:32,890
port is 1194 I can change it or leave it

1532
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,890
as it sent

1533
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:51,269
you will have the internal IEP and we

1534
01:45:48,970 --> 01:45:54,940
can decide whether we want all

1535
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:58,780
connection traffic goes through the

1536
01:45:54,940 --> 01:46:01,389
internet when we introduce the internal

1537
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:06,099
IP it could access our server but the

1538
01:46:01,390 --> 01:46:09,940
rest of the intrud would be using the

1539
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:12,840
internet were using once we gave this

1540
01:46:09,940 --> 01:46:16,120
certificate we need to create this

1541
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:20,220
cursor and this client or customer which

1542
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:20,220
is the video I like to show you and now

1543
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:28,990
and now we need to create a wizard we

1544
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:32,559
have created the rule in the firewall we

1545
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:41,040
are in 1194 we need to accept VPN

1546
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:41,040
connections and what we do now

1547
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:57,110
I think I skipped a video what we do is

1548
01:46:56,330 --> 01:47:03,380
the following

1549
01:46:57,110 --> 01:47:08,799
Oh intuitions

1550
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:17,180
so within pfSense a wizard to create

1551
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:18,980
client ie the VPN customer generator the

1552
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:20,960
idea is that the customer can have

1553
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:23,870
changed the certificate here it says

1554
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:27,140
selling customer export that gives me

1555
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:30,019
the password of the key the predefined

1556
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:32,360
key so that the user can log-in

1557
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:39,160
introduced the password created and the

1558
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:44,920
best access or connection save some time

1559
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:44,920
it's already being created I go to VPN

1560
01:47:45,190 --> 01:47:52,040
client export and I'll be able to export

1561
01:47:48,949 --> 01:47:58,400
to all these platforms for Android for

1562
01:47:52,040 --> 01:48:02,630
iOS for Windows and once we expert this

1563
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:04,790
customer and I'm not going to have time

1564
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:09,980
to show the video the customer will be

1565
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:12,710
able to access the customer will become

1566
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:15,589
resident you have the VPN open as you

1567
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:19,430
can see and it's very easy I can't

1568
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:21,949
decide whether I connect or not you can

1569
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:25,130
install this in Android devices as well

1570
01:48:21,949 --> 01:48:29,320
it's pretty useful so you're going to

1571
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:31,180
access your website you can use

1572
01:48:29,320 --> 01:48:34,809
your internet connection but all your

1573
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:37,920
traffic is encrypted and you're going to

1574
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:43,420
connect with an internal IP to that

1575
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:45,940
private net out at us well lower speed a

1576
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:49,740
bit slower than normal but very very

1577
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:56,830
safely and securely the necessary so you

1578
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:59,320
will have safe documents the next cloud

1579
01:48:56,830 --> 01:49:06,640
is inaccessible from the outside and

1580
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:08,440
this is why this cloud is secure and we

1581
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:11,200
can have all our data protected there

1582
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:13,929
who can access our data us and with

1583
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:16,510
measures we've implemented we're going

1584
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:21,550
to ensure that the information will be

1585
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:26,260
very very safe regardless of whether we

1586
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:29,520
have some backup copies are not I'm

1587
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:34,570
going to move on to the conclusions now

1588
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:44,470
as you have seen well there you have the

1589
01:49:34,570 --> 01:49:47,790
prices iPhone iCloud sorry prices 9 91

1590
01:49:44,470 --> 01:49:47,790
per month

1591
01:49:51,699 --> 01:50:00,199
for dress we have eight years mega has

1592
01:49:55,760 --> 01:50:02,949
those prices that you can see there two

1593
01:50:00,199 --> 01:50:06,559
terabytes twenty years per month this is

1594
01:50:02,949 --> 01:50:09,349
what we find in the market but we are

1595
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:12,469
paying for some space but in terms of

1596
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:17,510
security and privacy nobody can

1597
01:50:12,469 --> 01:50:22,070
guarantee that data are secure in the

1598
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:25,429
cloud that's why it is our ability to

1599
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:30,940
control all the information on a

1600
01:50:25,429 --> 01:50:36,469
real-time basis if I access my cloud I

1601
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:38,769
can see and view the server area not

1602
01:50:36,469 --> 01:50:38,770
this

1603
01:50:49,580 --> 01:51:06,150
if I go to admin yeah I have server info

1604
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:11,040
I can see the CPU load of the device the

1605
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:13,320
memory use at this moment in time is why

1606
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:17,640
Nixon if I accessed through a console I

1607
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:23,540
can access all the lock area number of

1608
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:23,540
active users number of shared resources

1609
01:51:24,710 --> 01:51:37,260
storage PHP version database size of the

1610
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:44,190
database at this time I can even connect

1611
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:47,940
this to external monitoring tools what

1612
01:51:44,190 --> 01:51:52,610
else this is what I mentioned earlier

1613
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:58,519
regarding an encryption to enable HTTPS

1614
01:51:52,610 --> 01:52:02,969
and the encryption of files I can

1615
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:09,170
generate a report on the use of the

1616
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:12,810
cloud and of course each user will have

1617
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:21,570
the report that can be sent on a weekly

1618
01:52:12,810 --> 01:52:23,340
basis a monthly basis and that this is

1619
01:52:21,570 --> 01:52:27,450
the perfect cloud I don't know who you

1620
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:31,230
have any questions microphone please

1621
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:33,660
otherwise I'm afraid we can't interpret

1622
01:52:31,230 --> 01:52:36,629
you can install this we've created a

1623
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:39,769
more robust platform and independent

1624
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:43,260
platform because we have other machines

1625
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:45,420
but openvpn can be installed you can

1626
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:47,220
integrate everything in that next kind

1627
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:52,470
of machine you can integrate the

1628
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:54,420
firewall and next out and OpenVPN more

1629
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:58,250
exactly the same and everything can be

1630
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:58,250
done under the umbrella of one machine

1631
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:12,090
recording apps what kind of applications

1632
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:16,080
can you find for example you can connect

1633
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:20,010
this to feet o face just an implemented

1634
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:23,840
here you need to have free office in the

1635
01:53:20,010 --> 01:53:27,930
service to be able to open a Word file

1636
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:31,080
or Google Docs same with LibreOffice

1637
01:53:27,930 --> 01:53:41,670
with free office as for apps let me take

1638
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:44,870
a look yeah apps are classified into

1639
01:53:41,670 --> 01:53:44,870
different categories

1640
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:52,019
depends on what you want you can have

1641
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:54,889
monitoring apps if you're interested in

1642
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:54,890
security

1643
01:53:55,760 --> 01:54:01,219
activities conducted by system

1644
01:53:58,049 --> 01:54:04,949
administrator office related issues

1645
01:54:01,219 --> 01:54:08,099
calendar options for example online

1646
01:54:04,949 --> 01:54:11,249
collaboration context here have been

1647
01:54:08,099 --> 01:54:14,149
enabled email function to create

1648
01:54:11,249 --> 01:54:19,349
templates possibility of editing

1650
01:54:19,349 --> 01:54:24,769
with dates if you go to further

1651
01:54:22,049 --> 01:54:27,510
description more description you can see

1652
01:54:24,769 --> 01:54:30,499
all the options available this is

1653
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:35,699
wonderful for collaborative projects and

1654
01:54:30,499 --> 01:54:39,989
you can add tasks as required these are

1655
01:54:35,699 --> 01:54:43,978
some interesting apps for the office not

1656
01:54:39,989 --> 01:54:46,919
only office is the application that

1657
01:54:43,979 --> 01:54:49,679
allows you to edit a file of free office

1658
01:54:46,919 --> 01:54:51,989
file online maybe buddy you don't have

1659
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:55,729
to download it you can do this online

1660
01:54:51,989 --> 01:54:59,848
and it also allows you to read e-books

1661
01:54:55,729 --> 01:55:02,939
you have you have want to have them

1662
01:54:59,849 --> 01:55:07,879
online you can connect yourself and read

1663
01:55:02,939 --> 01:55:10,049
them there's also a task function at an

1664
01:55:07,879 --> 01:55:15,539
organization or company level though

1665
01:55:10,049 --> 01:55:18,629
some contacts bookmarks what else there

1666
01:55:15,539 --> 01:55:24,529
is a tool for drawing another one for

1667
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:29,399
note-taking taking there are developers

1668
01:55:24,529 --> 01:55:32,369
developers because this is a very big

1669
01:55:29,399 --> 01:55:35,189
community after all and some developers

1670
01:55:32,369 --> 01:55:39,119
do this and this can be integrated for

1671
01:55:35,189 --> 01:55:43,159
example cebra allows me to connect my

1672
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:43,159
machine to other applications

1673
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:49,719
we have security aspects two-factor

1674
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:51,910
authentication socially she's in

1675
01:55:49,719 --> 01:55:57,730
communication another interesting thing

1676
01:55:51,910 --> 01:56:00,309
that you don't have an own cloud which

1677
01:55:57,730 --> 01:56:03,480
is the fact that you can do a video call

1678
01:56:00,310 --> 01:56:09,600
to another user with next cloud

1679
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:16,780
you also have GPX pop for geolocation

1680
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:20,550
purposes everything you can fathom and

1681
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:26,650
if you scratch under the surface

1682
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:30,820
you'll see the there's community it's an

1683
01:56:26,650 --> 01:56:34,440
open forum help dot next cloud.com

1684
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:37,750
where developers publish all the tools

1685
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:41,259
for next step special acknowledgements

1686
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:45,250
to host sick I mean whom I represent

1687
01:56:41,260 --> 01:56:48,550
don't want people for time issues that

1688
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:51,070
haven't been able to show their videos

1689
01:56:48,550 --> 01:56:53,560
and thank you to Antigua for the invite

1690
01:56:51,070 --> 01:56:57,910
any further questions or queries yes

1691
01:56:53,560 --> 01:57:06,100
apparently one using the mic please so

1692
01:56:57,910 --> 01:57:09,700
that we can interpret for example let me

1693
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:12,100
tell you something about this if you go

1694
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:18,000
to showed up for example there's this

1695
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:18,000
part called exploit maybe you showed um

1696
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:35,119
if I introduce in own cloud the

1697
01:57:33,329 --> 01:57:37,648
vulnerabilities I can see the

1698
01:57:35,119 --> 01:57:40,589
vulnerabilities of the latest version

1699
01:57:37,649 --> 01:57:45,570
you can look for this directly in

1700
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:49,800
preferences what do we recommend in

1701
01:57:45,570 --> 01:57:52,409
these cases well first to be subscribed

1702
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:56,399
to a forum because when there are new

1703
01:57:52,409 --> 01:57:59,759
vulnerabilities published the forum will

1704
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:01,860
distribute that info amongst users in

1705
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:04,409
the field of security in a company or in

1706
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:07,619
a personal basis whenever we install an

1707
01:58:04,409 --> 01:58:09,329
open-source software - we need to be

1708
01:58:07,619 --> 01:58:12,148
subscribed to there - it's the only way

1709
01:58:09,329 --> 01:58:14,759
of finding out we can be on the lookout

1710
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:16,769
for that info we can't pretend to be

1711
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:18,539
reading the blogs and the far enough so

1712
01:58:16,769 --> 01:58:20,939
the best way is to be subscribed and

1713
01:58:18,539 --> 01:58:23,518
whenever for example you use Moodle

1714
01:58:20,939 --> 01:58:25,860
Moodle alerts are often received by an

1715
01:58:23,519 --> 01:58:28,999
email of your subscribe so make sure you

1716
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:31,739
register to the forum so whenever a new

1717
01:58:28,999 --> 01:58:35,309
vulnerability is detected we are duly

1718
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:37,348
not to fight otherwise it would be bit

1719
01:58:35,309 --> 01:58:46,229
difficult because you would have to be

1720
01:58:37,349 --> 01:58:51,239
surfing for security of news and a thief

1721
01:58:46,229 --> 01:58:54,629
is wonderful you can receive info if you

1722
01:58:51,239 --> 01:58:56,699
register too in thievish newsletter or a

1723
01:58:54,629 --> 01:59:00,929
news bulletin and you will be notified

1724
01:58:56,699 --> 01:59:04,228
on these vulnerabilities in companies

1725
01:59:00,929 --> 01:59:08,070
there should be someone that centralizes

1726
01:59:04,229 --> 01:59:12,899
all these communications so that person

1727
01:59:08,070 --> 01:59:16,558
is informed in on vulnerabilities linux

1728
01:59:12,899 --> 01:59:19,679
for security updates be interesting to

1729
01:59:16,559 --> 01:59:22,649
do an update the machine once a month as

1730
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:25,559
for apps I recommend that you register

1731
01:59:22,649 --> 01:59:28,709
subscribe to the fs the way best way of

1732
01:59:25,559 --> 01:59:30,269
learning about new vulnerabilities there

1733
01:59:28,709 --> 01:59:33,409
are no further questions like to thank

1734
01:59:30,269 --> 01:59:35,889
you thank you very much

1735
01:59:33,409 --> 01:59:35,888
attention

1736
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,820
you
