1
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:25,448
so we have two hours with you and I'm

2
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:28,119
looking forward to it I always say and I

3
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:29,649
said it in Twitter yesterday and when

4
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,980
they asked me where are you from I'm

5
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:36,970
from Bilbao I'm a fan of athletic that

6
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,720
bilbao's from from it but I was born

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,610
here in Santander my family are from

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,140
Quetta

9
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,110
we're from kappa my yard

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,019
we are from Santander so for me being

11
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,089
here it's like being home maybe if you

12
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:54,549
don't know me this is something that you

13
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:57,010
always repeat way everywhere you go but

14
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:59,049
I'm very happy and excited to be in

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:04,298
Santander because it's the first time I

16
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:08,860
can give a talk about a subject that I

17
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:11,650
just love blockchain and it is not just

18
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:15,789
looking for your applause but it's a

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:18,820
pride so we have two hours so yes two

20
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:23,500
hours of excitement today we'll speak

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:26,139
about blood chain and Bitcoin it's nine

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,980
four hundred yesterday was eleven fifty

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,570
five hundred it just in couple of hours

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,100
business changes so much I don't know

25
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:38,440
how many of you have bitcoins doesn't

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,059
matter no problem we can't see you in

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,479
the in the cameras you can't we can't

28
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,630
see you than in the room at least two

29
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:49,690
people yes six people for the one

30
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:53,259
dynamics and two other to steal money so

31
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:56,920
you'll be participating so we're trying

32
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:00,010
to explain several concepts about how

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:03,159
the blockchain technology works we see

34
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:06,460
some applications that are interesting

35
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,319
for us and the cyber security unit in

36
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,810
telefónica that we are we feel that

37
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,798
these are apps are attractive for

38
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,420
developing malware and of evil but these

39
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:20,830
technology offers other functionalities

40
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,238
that are good we need to know them so we

41
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,520
have to have them in mind especially

42
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,950
when we need to make analysis serve

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,349
blockchain and sweating Gers cat

44
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,268
this is a metaphor why we'll see that

45
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:37,420
yes we'd like to explain what is

46
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:40,150
blockchain why these systems that are

47
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:44,829
decentralized did appear with this

48
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:50,610
mental exercise in 1935 was created by

49
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,610
Erwin Schroedinger in this exercise

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:59,410
there was a cat inside a bunker with

51
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:01,239
powder so for an external agent and

52
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,940
looking at the bunker from outside

53
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:07,720
there's the same probability that this

54
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,480
powder blasts and kills the cat and in

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:17,170
the same probability that the cat can

56
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:19,268
survive but until you enter into the

57
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,970
bunker and you see what happens to the

58
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:26,099
cat that you realize what happens so the

59
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:32,260
cat is dead or or it has survived

60
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:35,108
because you introduced powder so it is

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,840
it's about curiosity that people have

62
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:40,780
what's happening inside here it's inside

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,930
a bunker but we deal with security and

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,989
we have all the tools to enter the

65
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:55,329
bunkers technology and blockchain in

66
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:59,470
particular was born because of society

67
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:01,180
thousands of years ago we delegated

68
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,510
responsibilities on governments

69
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:10,859
corporations accompanies or we'd evolved

70
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:12,100
our responsibility and in a way we have

71
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,989
decentralized

72
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:20,139
about responsibility because we don't

73
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:22,870
trust them fully so we have a free

74
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:24,970
software coming out from that what we

75
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,750
wanted to underline is that these

76
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:31,479
technologies and free software we we are

77
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,530
believers in free software this tries to

78
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:37,570
answer this opacity this big companies

79
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,400
we don't really know how they're they

80
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:44,280
operate with our data and our

81
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,280
information every software uses code

82
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,700
Charles Stallman and all the people

83
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,830
working in free software you know that

84
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:56,740
for freedoms to read Code Red Code study

85
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:59,409
the code modify the code editing it and

86
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,920
distributing the code and what are the

87
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:07,180
four freedoms I just can't remember now

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:11,890
so four freedoms are in software and

89
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:14,710
applications were what happens when this

90
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,289
is included in a connected system the

91
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,969
beginning of the 90s if you had internet

92
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,180
connection you were lucky but today

93
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:25,530
almost all of us are connected so the

94
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,370
solution to avoid this type of

95
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:32,409
decentralization problems or

96
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:34,330
opacification as' of a big companies is

97
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,880
something that we can solve with

98
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:42,240
blockchain let's see how blockchain

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:46,120
works imagine that Alice wants to send a

100
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,180
bit constable she'll make a transaction

101
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,550
and she'll sign it with her private key

102
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:55,810
she only knows her key sometimes she

103
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,940
doesn't know that a key so sometimes we

104
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,740
have to be careful with keys so the

105
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,229
information of this transaction signed

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,169
by her is notified to the rest of

107
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,810
network hubs and after the validation

108
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:09,700
one of their hubs will be at the block

109
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,490
to the new the new block to the

110
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,770
blockchain and blocks are not added in

111
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,370
[Music]

112
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:21,789
in a specific way

113
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:24,550
blocks are added ones one one after the

114
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:31,000
other it was it was started with

115
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:35,229
bitcoins nine nine nine of January then

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,450
the 8th of January 2009 that's when it

117
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:42,780
started

118
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:45,039
this big coin proposal started in 2008

119
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,380
it's a figure but we don't know if it's

120
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,280
a figure or a group of people or a

121
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:53,860
collective I don't know it's a group so

122
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,440
this started to be implemented in 2009

123
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,770
and chained in the blocks all the blocks

124
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,190
are

125
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:03,849
change that's why it's it's called

126
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:06,940
blockchain so if you change a Bitcoin

127
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:10,719
the sequence is changed and persistency

128
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,580
is will disappear so information is

129
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,139
replicated you know the hops of the

130
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,539
network and Bob can use the because that

131
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:23,020
he received and which were transferred

132
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:25,810
by Alice what does this imply all the

133
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,900
hops to come the full hops in the

134
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,750
Bitcoin network at the copy of the

135
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,318
accounting log of with all the

136
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,199
transactions that are being generated

137
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,720
throughout the history of this

138
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,449
blockchain this implies that in fact

139
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,219
what we can say it's an efficient

140
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:54,490
because all of them have the exact copy

141
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:56,740
could be 150 jjigae if we want to buy go

142
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:01,930
to put this and equipment it will have

143
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,460
to put one SSD with 150 Jigga it's too

144
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,430
much it's too much it's getting more and

145
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:11,409
more expensive if we only want bitcoins

146
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:14,349
if we want beacon ghost cache etc our

147
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:20,710
SSD will need to be terrors and terrors

148
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:23,380
of our capacity so we add a blog in the

149
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:29,979
blockchain and for this we need to do

150
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:31,740
proof of proof of work POWs this means

151
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:35,409
that you have to solve a mathematical

152
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,599
test if you are faster than others you

153
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:40,149
have more probabilities to add your blog

154
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,810
in the blockchain this mathematical

155
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:45,550
problem

156
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:48,010
in fact if we were all part of the

157
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,339
Bitcoin chain we don't really know who's

158
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:55,060
the next network hub who's the next who

159
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:58,870
is going to add a new block so there's

160
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,399
nobody that can say that I'm not going

161
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,120
to add this block you don't know who's

162
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,430
gonna do it after you it's random with

163
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,170
an algorithm and random algorithm that

164
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,540
we will introduce and maybe the next

165
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:16,180
block is not entering but the next after

166
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:18,760
next maybe it's someone who doesn't know

167
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,219
that his problems are going to be added

168
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,100
it's not about this accident you give it

169
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,470
away because there are incentives the

170
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,840
goal is to represent what this

171
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,140
blockchain is all about let's do an

172
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:35,050
exercise let's play a game we need

173
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:38,380
volunteers six volunteers for this

174
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:43,000
exercise and then there's an award as a

175
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:48,660
prize you're going to have to win a

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,660
prize please volunteers come up here

177
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:59,980
these six people have to play together

178
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:02,020
and pool in two groups with this for

179
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:07,600
this computational capacity the idea is

180
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:09,730
to mine so pool to foodtube is made of

181
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,840
three people pool one two people and

182
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:16,990
there is an isolated hub

183
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:20,530
fifteen euros from up here there's a

184
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:27,910
prize there's an award anybody we need

185
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:36,339
more people come up here we need six

186
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:38,199
people okay so we're going to team in

187
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,590
the following way a group of three

188
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,650
people

189
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:46,540
that's pool two so we'll look for a

190
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,430
solution if you know other other people

191
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,939
in the team another group of two people

192
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:55,270
another person will who will be alone

193
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,360
the isolated hub let's imagine that we

194
00:10:55,270 --> 00:11:00,990
all have a computational capacity that

195
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,980
is standard it's more or less the same

196
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,980
so we are all clever

197
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,550
the team with more possibilities to add

198
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,620
the next block is the one who is

199
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:19,569
composed of three people because you're

200
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:21,220
three we are all you have the same

201
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:22,810
conversational capacity but we you are

202
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,480
three you have more possibilities to

203
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:31,540
find a solution to this mathematical

204
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:36,940
problem sometimes we played this game

205
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:39,519
and people didn't understand so pool two

206
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,970
is three people collaborating two others

207
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:48,759
will be the pool one Daniel and

208
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:52,180
Christian second pool the mining pool

209
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:56,649
not one and you are the isolated hub you

210
00:11:52,180 --> 00:12:00,569
are alone you have less probabilities to

211
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:04,990
women sometimes the isolated hot winds

212
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:07,719
well maybe you can win also even though

213
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:11,560
you're only two or just one we have six

214
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,800
hops in our networks and you have to

215
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:20,500
show that we are half money we'll have

216
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:24,189
money so we're now looking at the money

217
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:28,569
but this address starting with 1 X 7 all

218
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:33,459
the Bitcoin addresses it starts with the

219
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:36,639
same letters it starts with 1 or 3 the

220
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:42,310
Bitcoin addresses in the main it and

221
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:45,339
test net starts with M or n so when we

222
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:49,329
see it this chain this long maybe it's a

223
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:51,149
Bitcoin address in this case what how

224
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:56,649
much money

225
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:58,269
0:07 16 pay little money it's about 15

226
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:02,740
euros 15 years

227
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:07,240
that's the money that's in there you can

228
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:10,149
use the point very market cup it's quite

229
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,120
a well-known website where you can see

230
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:17,790
follow the evolution of prices prices

231
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,790
how much a bitcoin is now

232
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:27,069
[Music]

233
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:31,900
$9,500 if the etherium its evolving its

234
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:35,940
oscillating this is real time you see

235
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:40,630
how much cost and the change rates

236
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:45,120
exchange rates at the beginning it was

237
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:47,890
just one euro one Bitcoin one euro and

238
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,320
we were here telling you stories but we

239
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,319
would have been rich the mathematical

240
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:59,560
exercise we have a ready and we'll see

241
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:04,689
the mathematical operation with very

242
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:07,150
simple mathematical exercise if you

243
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:13,240
discover the answer raise your hand and

244
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:15,760
you say it okay now tell me now and

245
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,990
suddenly we have to decide who adds the

246
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:22,540
next block problem an operation look for

247
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,480
a number that can be divided by 7 8 by 5

248
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:34,020
and which is greater than a thousand and

249
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:34,020
lower than 2000 please raise your hand

250
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:46,240
why 1400 well yeah that's correct

251
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:49,570
this number is can be divided by 7 and

252
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,290
by 5 this team has solved the problem

253
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:55,420
first so you have the priviledge plus

254
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,640
the big canoes are you going to win you

255
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,209
have the privilege to add the next block

256
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:04,569
to the blockchain with the 3 actions

257
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:06,939
that will be generated the next block

258
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,640
well once this one has been generated

259
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:13,240
there's another mathematical problem and

260
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:18,010
then we will see who wins and who puts

261
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,720
the next block next block there's

262
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,720
another mathematical problem to solve

263
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,769
and the problem in fact is not

264
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,160
multiplying 7 by 5 and see if it's

265
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:31,930
greater than a thousand or lower than in

266
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,769
two thousand it's to identify a hash

267
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:38,229
that starts me with twenty zeroes in has

268
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:41,290
the hashes has to have to start with a

269
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:45,879
twenty first digits and they have to be

270
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:48,368
zeros and as the conversational capacity

271
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,740
of the network increases six hundred of

272
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:55,089
sixty or six thousand you will have more

273
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:57,189
possibilities to identify identify in

274
00:15:55,089 --> 00:16:00,309
the network a hash that starts with her

275
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:02,259
I don't know how many are zeros the has

276
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:07,290
generation we don't not know it until

277
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:08,499
it's generated so it is distributed so

278
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:13,929
congratulations

279
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:16,089
pool - yes pool pool - you're going to

280
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:19,600
win bitcoins do you have Bitcoin address

281
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:22,329
some of you have a Bitcoin address well

282
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,329
we'll explain how it works how we're

283
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:28,689
going to make this Bitcoin transfer

284
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:31,149
let's explain the system and how it

285
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:33,569
works and how we can we can transfer you

286
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:36,459
the money so we have a winner

287
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:40,449
don't leave because I have to give you

288
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:45,540
the price you have to wait until the end

289
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:49,179
of your talk so how are we going to

290
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:53,469
store this private key or this address

291
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:56,769
that we need to send to our colleague

292
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:00,429
it's called ET wallets it's a software

293
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:02,980
or hardware that saves this addresses or

294
00:17:00,429 --> 00:17:08,619
private keys these private keys or

295
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:12,490
passwords indicate that it's our you

296
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:16,270
have to save the passwords private key

297
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,789
public key if we lose the private key

298
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,789
word private King we can't really show

299
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:23,260
that bitcoins are ours because they are

300
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:27,809
in our address but we have to

301
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:31,419
demonstrate that what happens sometimes

302
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:34,629
because we're not very good at that

303
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:36,520
because you don't give it the importance

304
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,380
of it deserves you get to get the first

305
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:43,120
your first bitcoins

306
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:45,100
you go to add pages and you click on

307
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,979
that and you have captures and you get

308
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,260
thousands of bitcoins or the sorry

309
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,200
Milly Bitcoin today is one dollar or ten

310
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,760
dollars you get Milly bitcoins you have

311
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,480
the Firefox you put it in your virtual

312
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,340
machine and you start winning bitcoins

313
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,070
so you started to mine and mine and mine

314
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,929
and you have segments of bitcoins and I

315
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,810
protected them in a wallets that I had

316
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:10,150
in my equipment in my PC away the

317
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,399
password that was very good so good that

318
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,930
I just just forgot about it and what

319
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,700
happens I don't know the password if I

320
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,160
don't know the key or the password I

321
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,530
used to protect the private key of my

322
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,710
bitcoins I don't I just can't get the

323
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:25,660
money out if you won't go to a bag one

324
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,270
you need a password to get the money I

325
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,150
can't use my money thirteen nine cents

326
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,310
were two to three dollars you can't

327
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:37,690
recover that because you had generated

328
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:48,419
it from your client you know in your in

329
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:51,370
your computer and my my he wallets were

330
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,650
encrypted and some other software do

331
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,020
that for you but the wallet what about

332
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,890
the wallet I am NOT I can't really look

333
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:03,550
for my password so my wallet is base64

334
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:09,310
this is a challenge that we used in

335
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:13,570
return in 2015 so we put it in base64

336
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:18,280
this is the the wallet you can paste bin

337
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:21,780
you can see it in paste bin you can you

338
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:28,300
see it in the YouTube image in the video

339
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:31,870
so you you download this space 64 is it

340
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:36,909
CTF with a real city F it's an e wallet

341
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:40,030
with encrypted piece and today if you

342
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:44,470
can decrypt it you can get this 39 cents

343
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:48,060
of Bitcoin and if you can do it while

344
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:50,370
you you you can buy us some beers if you

345
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:58,020
decrypt it

346
00:19:50,370 --> 00:20:02,159
young crew let's imagine this is a

347
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:06,270
hundred thousand it's $45,000 it's a lot

348
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,830
of money if you can decipher it it's a

349
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:12,770
problem and we need to solve this

350
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,770
problem that I forgot my my password so

351
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,100
I cannot recover this because I can't

352
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:23,520
decode because I protected my private

353
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:26,159
keys that's a problem and I'm not the

354
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:32,370
only one one of the addresses that we

355
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:41,880
use well we have the random addresses in

356
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:46,620
a random way I'll show it to you now bit

357
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:49,020
address dot or this is a free software

358
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:53,610
project this is a repository it takes

359
00:20:49,020 --> 00:21:02,160
the positions you see the green dots

360
00:20:53,610 --> 00:21:03,959
these are like random seeds so I don't

361
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,820
know if there's a technology that takes

362
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,220
all the points these are seeds to

363
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:14,010
generate this a Bitcoin address that

364
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:17,490
starts with 1 7 etc and a private key

365
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:22,200
that's been generated from this green

366
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:24,180
points the seed 0 random points but you

367
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,020
don't need to have an address you can

368
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:31,050
add many addresses bit address you can

369
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:36,110
generate more and another one it starts

370
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:40,340
with 1 e em e 1q k you want

371
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:46,020
it's a rapid way of generating addresses

372
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:47,760
another type if I lose this maybe I

373
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,030
shall assist ASIC and she cannot control

374
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,920
that it's what happened to me so take

375
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,100
this into account this is public

376
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:59,550
the address is public I give it to the

377
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:02,070
people I want to be paid from and this

378
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,720
is the private part with private key

379
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:17,918
another type of a wallets the bring

380
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:21,970
wallets yeah put a keyword Cybercom 2017

381
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:25,960
Santander this is going to generate an

382
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:28,090
address and a private key in ruta to two

383
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,549
years ago we did this exercise to take a

384
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:33,639
lot of dictionaries and generate a lot

385
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:36,580
of addresses the greater number of

386
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:38,678
addresses so people had taken this

387
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:42,189
decision to do this type to have this

388
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:44,139
type of wallets but if you know the

389
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:49,629
world you can access to this private

390
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:51,748
keys and steal the money this is about

391
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:55,869
bad practice this is a bad practice

392
00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:57,909
instead of using up serial random seed

393
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:59,619
we have been using a word and that's

394
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:02,259
full of problems that have their

395
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:05,320
advantage that I got can go anywhere and

396
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:09,159
without being a Bitcoin client I am

397
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:12,460
generating this address on the spot but

398
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:17,669
we did it in and wrote it and analyzed

399
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:21,759
four million words I can look for the

400
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:24,610
presentation password hello very

401
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:29,889
well-known words in dictionaries and the

402
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:31,869
number of transfer bitcoins to wallets

403
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:35,408
that were generated in this way was

404
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:37,389
around 20 or 19 bitcoins multiplied by

405
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:43,929
ten thousand it's not bad

406
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:48,758
three thousand dollars at the time it's

407
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:55,320
not usual some of them existed at the

408
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:57,779
time then we have the multi signature

409
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:02,129
wallets

410
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:04,499
these wallets have three addresses so

411
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:07,199
when you configure the addresses you can

412
00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:09,539
choose how many addresses are necessary

413
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,429
or which address is necessary to move

414
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:14,039
the money to transfer the money and do

415
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:15,840
you unblock the private key that I was

416
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,759
going to move the money out of the

417
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,889
wallet this is what it starts with the

418
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:23,879
number three the normal addresses

419
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:25,709
started with one in Bitcoin and for what

420
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,149
it's generated in this way it's not the

421
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,849
original standard they start with a

422
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:31,799
number three maybe what is the type of

423
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:35,968
problem that this tries to solve this

424
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:43,379
type of wallets we can generate a wallet

425
00:24:35,969 --> 00:24:45,779
with 20 public addresses if I have 20

426
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:48,389
and dresses that participate in two in

427
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:51,809
this wallet and I say no we I need at

428
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:53,129
least 15 of those to move the money to

429
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:56,729
transfer the money what's the problem

430
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:59,939
that this solves wait we can't hear what

431
00:24:56,729 --> 00:25:01,830
they say in the room yes we need to you

432
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,769
to say it's in the microphone in a

433
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,869
company where capital is shared between

434
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:10,259
different people what happens is this

435
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:12,869
just in one address with one private key

436
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,729
I have the money of my company here in

437
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:18,149
this Bitcoin address with one private

438
00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:22,469
key and we have two of us we have the

439
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:26,369
copy of the private key and then I go

440
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:28,789
away but I trust her I go to the weekend

441
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:31,918
and gender is the weekend she transfers

442
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:33,899
the capital of our company because she's

443
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,210
called the private key she transfers it

444
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:38,238
into her account and she says that it's

445
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,799
been stolen what do I do

446
00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:41,249
I've been cheated so to solve this

447
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,109
problem

448
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:48,210
yes you can't go back you can't go back

449
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:51,119
you've done a transaction and you can't

450
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:56,580
go back you can't undo it there's no

451
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:58,439
backup unless yatha decided to give me

452
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,928
the give me the back on the money back

453
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,599
so with this solution if you we have two

454
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:06,629
addresses we can generate one multi

455
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:09,059
signature address is so requiring that

456
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:10,379
to sign to transfer the money we have to

457
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:13,830
sign to

458
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,930
we have our own private key and we need

459
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:19,050
to sign both of us need to sign for this

460
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:22,440
transfer this is typical as we can see

461
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:26,430
here this is not new about stealing

462
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:30,810
wallets it started in the beginning of

463
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:34,170
2015 there was malware that used to

464
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:36,990
steal these small files where the

465
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,150
private keys are stored in your computer

466
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:42,860
these files are not protected with a

467
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:47,010
private key and it's left like this any

468
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:49,110
malicious program a malware can find

469
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,180
that for you and they can steal it from

470
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:54,000
you if you haven't protected it with a

471
00:26:51,180 --> 00:27:01,260
password or if they are protected with a

472
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:04,020
bat or a weak password and people are

473
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,750
now using this type of systems with this

474
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:11,370
type of currencies and there is a lot of

475
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:15,260
fighting and other types of problems two

476
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:19,500
years it wasn't for 2015 it was quite

477
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:22,980
rare was it was unfrequent we had this

478
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:25,850
it's the banking malware and there were

479
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,560
mmm

480
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:31,169
instead of banks it was domains and

481
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:37,129
there was malware directed to that type

482
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:42,690
of stealing it was it was attacking

483
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:46,670
exchange platforms and markets etc so

484
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:51,240
they were affecting platforms and the

485
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:55,560
wallet stealing malware is there out out

486
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,990
there you can sometimes install it by

487
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:01,080
defect and you can't see it and it will

488
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:04,160
stay still your keys and there is a

489
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,169
small file Jason

490
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:10,980
whether the data related to your wallet

491
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:13,620
if we don't protect it efficiently if I

492
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:17,730
was doing malware well it's easy to

493
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:20,209
steal there's a risk and then we have

494
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,210
another problem

495
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:26,960
the the more and more projects with

496
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:30,690
currencies with market cameras a

497
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,389
thousand room or more projects and one

498
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:37,830
of them is Bitcoin gold this is on the

499
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:40,799
26th of November we are on the 30th of

500
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:43,199
November today it was on it was last

501
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,529
Sunday was it a note that was published

502
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:50,510
the the source code that were published

503
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:53,909
which is a Bitcoin gold it's a new

504
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:55,620
crypto currency related to Bitcoin well

505
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:59,460
the hash of the finder was being

506
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:05,370
distributed with the official hash but

507
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,809
this file that was distributed for 14

508
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,018
hours

509
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:13,139
no there was four point five days it's

510
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:17,279
written here maybe there was a malware

511
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:19,199
inside that was stealing I was looking

512
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,220
for this type of files this problem is

513
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:27,600
now affecting cryptocurrencies and now

514
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:30,289
we spoke about mining incentives you

515
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,240
were contributing with your

516
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:35,820
computational capacity because you

517
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,429
wanted to win the game because they

518
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:42,149
don't work on will be new currencies to

519
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:44,970
be generated in Bitcoin and that when we

520
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:47,459
make a transfer money Bitcoin transfer

521
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,490
we don't put your Commission on top of

522
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,860
it but we want to include a commission

523
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,320
so that we can attract those miners so

524
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:58,139
that they can add that transactions or

525
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,730
they prefer my transactions so instead

526
00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:04,408
of others so the creation of new

527
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:08,659
currencies we can see it in blocks dot

528
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:11,549
info what are the incentives are miners

529
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:15,029
with another transaction let's say the

530
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:18,418
concepts with theoretical concepts we

531
00:30:15,029 --> 00:30:22,110
take a block the last one is starting

532
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:24,389
with by with four there are hundreds of

533
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:27,860
thousands of blocks in Bitcoin blocks

534
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:27,860
and this block was

535
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:35,550
I don't know if you remember it was a

536
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:39,220
transaction set no a set of transactions

537
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:41,649
was a biga were being added by a minor

538
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:45,520
and being added to the previous one here

539
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:49,929
is the result up here yes

540
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:56,650
and in this block well the reward what

541
00:30:49,929 --> 00:31:01,210
is the reward for this block 12.5

542
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:03,010
bitcoins let's see it

543
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:08,070
every time we generate or we add a new

544
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:11,970
block the miners are giving you rewards

545
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:14,230
because you are increasing the

546
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:18,370
computational capacity because a lot of

547
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:21,910
Jigga's dedicated to that so the reward

548
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:25,419
what is they get paid with new newly

549
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:28,020
generated currencies and then each of

550
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,670
those transactions which are quite big

551
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:37,330
each of those transactions we can click

552
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:40,390
on one not just no not that one this one

553
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:46,470
this is a transaction where there is an

554
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:50,470
address you qhj that transfers money to

555
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:55,690
do 10 different direct addresses each of

556
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:57,970
these transactions here indicates an

557
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,700
amount for commission that i want to pay

558
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:06,970
the minor this commissions were just

559
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:10,780
cents now it's seven or eight dollars on

560
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:13,059
average that this is the the commission

561
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:17,050
some platforms have a tracking of his

562
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:20,770
commissions so when did this system

563
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:22,600
start well the first the first operation

564
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:25,510
that was registered in the blockchain

565
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,419
was blocked one corresponding to block

566
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:30,550
one and it was registered on a ninth

567
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:33,910
January 2009 there are no entries this

568
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:36,399
node address that is sending money to

569
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,020
another address these 50 bitcoins are

570
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,450
generated at the beginning when there

571
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:43,000
was a block added to the

572
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:44,730
blockchain miners received 50 bitcoins

573
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,670
that was the award

574
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:51,670
how many dollars a lot that's a lot then

575
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:55,060
we see another operation of a

576
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:57,610
transaction that is corresponds to the

577
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:02,230
currency generation that's another block

578
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:07,929
but then we see the normal transaction

579
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:12,310
it's the the one here 12 CB etc with 50

580
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:15,400
bitcoins and then this is the Miss money

581
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:18,639
is divided in ten bitcoins plus for 40

582
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:21,360
bitcoins that's 50 bitcoins so there are

583
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:26,710
two different transfers to two addresses

584
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:29,800
so this is the first transaction it was

585
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:32,230
money transfer a bitcoin transfer from

586
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,210
one address from one Bitcoin address to

587
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,630
another Bitcoin address until then don't

588
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:39,880
remember the number of blocks but but it

589
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:43,240
was mined on the 12th of January three

590
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:46,510
days later we can look for the number

591
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:50,550
until then all the blocks had all

592
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:53,440
transactions from Bitcoin to real money

593
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:58,360
so the money had to be entered into the

594
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,430
system it's not exactly how we did in

595
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,639
the exercise but they started to

596
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,770
distribute bitcoins this is a little bit

597
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,590
about what we said earlier you've seen

598
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:13,509
the first minting of the money it was

599
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:20,070
for 50 bitcoins that's what the mines

600
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:23,530
- got and every four years it's when

601
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:26,830
there's a new coffee that is mining

602
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:30,280
received half the money that they

603
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:33,509
received previously for minting the

604
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:37,030
money this is November 2012

605
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:39,610
it's almost every four years and it

606
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:42,820
really it's every 210 thousand blocks

607
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:45,760
that are added the reward is divided by

608
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:51,100
half so what we're seeing the

609
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:53,139
that in the end - are gonna find it

610
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,949
profitable to mine in this system

611
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:58,600
because of the mine minting the

612
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:04,350
Commission's they receive it is going to

613
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:09,160
be reduced by half every four years the

614
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:15,940
estimation in this graph is to 2040 21

615
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:17,819
40 and that's where work reached the

616
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:21,430
limit 2136

617
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:24,910
in blockchain info you can have a look

618
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:27,819
here at block two thousand two hundred

619
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,160
and ten thousand two hundred and ten

620
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:43,020
thousand that's block two hundred and

621
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:45,670
ten thousand it's getting a bit stuck

622
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:48,759
this is block two hundred and ten

623
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:54,630
thousand here you can see the block

624
00:35:48,760 --> 00:36:02,470
reward is just 25 bitcoins if we put we

625
00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:09,730
look for two hundred 9999 there

626
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:12,609
the reward is fifty it's difficult that

627
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:14,860
you you giving the same computational

628
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:16,780
capacity but just because you did it ten

629
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:20,950
minutes later you only gets half the

630
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:25,090
reward and that's a block from November

631
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:27,220
I think we're now not in 25 bitcoins

632
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:34,750
we've gone down it's not 12 and a half

633
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:37,330
bitcoins since about July 2016 so what's

634
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:42,460
gonna be the other operation which

635
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:46,529
perhaps compensates a - well the idea of

636
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,530
Commission's to carry out a transaction

637
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:54,140
they're gonna include a fee

638
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:55,730
if I was a minor and I wanted the

639
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,770
Commission's of all the transactions

640
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:03,890
that exist I'd probably want to get

641
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:05,780
there first I can get more money and the

642
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:10,609
example that we gave a couple of years

643
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:13,910
ago we had of a wallet which had an

644
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:16,850
address with a key word I can't remember

645
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,220
what the key word was now but there were

646
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:21,710
people within this system who were

647
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,910
monitoring these addresses with these

648
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,820
three words

649
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:28,250
maybe the key the key word is password

650
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:30,580
for example we saw that in certain

651
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,380
seconds of times there were three

652
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:36,110
addresses asking for the money that we

653
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,540
had that is three different people were

654
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:41,800
signing transactions to get the money

655
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,800
that could happen

656
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:50,680
three different people are doing it at

657
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:52,839
the same time so in this process when

658
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,430
you have to be quick as possible what

659
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:56,739
did one of the addresses do they said

660
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:02,769
okay I'll I'll increase the Commission

661
00:37:56,739 --> 00:38:05,109
so that - give priority to their

662
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:09,488
transmission their transaction sorry I

663
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:12,130
suppose to the others what we wanted to

664
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:14,739
do is to sort of put out a bait there a

665
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,480
bait of money to see how many people

666
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:19,559
were out there it's a good example

667
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,559
because there were people out there

668
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:28,119
monitoring lots of these kinds of

669
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:35,289
accounts so proximate we've got an

670
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:38,019
account here how much - receiving at the

671
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:42,430
moment for minting new coins twelve and

672
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:44,410
a half bitcoins for minting and a 15%

673
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:49,779
Commission at the moment is around two

674
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:57,399
bitcoins so it's two bitcoins depending

675
00:38:49,779 --> 00:39:02,339
upon the time if now we went to the next

676
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:07,269
having that is the next time the amount

677
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:15,578
for minting money is half then it would

678
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:18,689
be so - would then receive 6.25 bitcoins

679
00:39:15,579 --> 00:39:21,099
let's leave the Commission as it was

680
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:24,039
let's just assume that the Commission's

681
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:30,930
are what they were but what does that

682
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:33,839
mean it means as having's continued the

683
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:37,299
Commission's side of thing is gonna be

684
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:41,049
increasingly important so the idea is

685
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:42,940
that - have sufficient incentive to

686
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:45,420
increase their computing ability and ask

687
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:48,220
for commissions

688
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:52,930
this is a typical supply and demand

689
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:55,009
graph on the x-axis we've got the space

690
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,810
for each forelock

691
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:59,540
we said that in each block you can

692
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:02,090
include certain number of transactions

693
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:04,400
and on access why the permissions that

694
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:08,950
you have to pay it's important what the

695
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:12,410
æther is saying because X represents the

696
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:15,529
space that you can include foot of

697
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:19,629
transactions every 10 minutes the

698
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:23,180
mathematical problem is on average

699
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:28,550
solved by each node in the network each

700
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:36,618
hub in it every ten minutes if it was a

701
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:38,990
lot quickly you'd add 24 zeros it isn't

702
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:41,030
a normal graph here we have something

703
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:45,470
that limits us which is the space in

704
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:51,140
each block today a Bitcoin has one

705
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:52,180
measure of space and at the moment this

706
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,660
system is becoming increasingly

707
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:58,940
important it may well be that now

708
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:01,970
initially in each bak block there was

709
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:06,280
two transactions but now as this system

710
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:08,868
is becoming increasingly popular more

711
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,940
transactions are being included in the

712
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:14,300
block space that lease that block is

713
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,830
being filled up so the balance point is

714
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,460
going up and the price of the

715
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:22,250
Commission's to pay is going up as the

716
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:26,300
block fills up the commission price goes

717
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:31,750
up so instead of getting a traditional

718
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:34,940
supply and demand curve as we've got a

719
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:40,190
quantity that that we can't go below

720
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:49,369
beyond then the increase in prices gets

721
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:51,020
gonna be a lot greater in 2012 people

722
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:54,859
thought oh you know bitcoins great case

723
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:58,480
you can save commission but now

724
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:58,480
commissions are around $8

725
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:08,080
for example we've tried it you can

726
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:11,740
sometimes put or 10 euros and you get

727
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,560
three years in commissions but I think a

728
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:23,020
year or so ago in a hackathon that we

729
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:29,279
organized we we presented this new

730
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:29,280
project and when we organized the demo

731
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:37,510
by the way we've been working 24 hours

732
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:48,340
all night preparing the product for the

733
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:49,900
demo we put the Commission's high so

734
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:52,510
that people could see that what we done

735
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:56,110
worked but in the end that was how it

736
00:42:52,510 --> 00:43:02,770
looked and some people didn't understand

737
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:04,480
this project and the block chain didn't

738
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:06,759
show the transaction we thought it

739
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,610
didn't work we were a bit too greedy

740
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:14,130
with the Commission's no miner was

741
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:16,780
interest in the demo time to add our

742
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:19,810
transaction we just being too clear of

743
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:23,350
her own good if we apply this to real

744
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:29,049
life imagine a system in which bitcoins

745
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:34,330
used if I take 15 minutes for my

746
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:40,630
transaction to get to be priority and to

747
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:44,890
be confirmed they're gonna Bitcoin its

748
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:47,020
clocks up act every 10 minutes in other

749
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:51,400
currencies it can be every 2 seconds

750
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:54,790
every 5 minutes so that's what people

751
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:58,900
are playing with and the problem of the

752
00:43:54,790 --> 00:44:01,810
size of blocks is represented on this

753
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:05,200
graph initially there were no

754
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:07,990
transactions because the system wasn't

755
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,379
well no nobody'd heard about it very

756
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:13,540
much but as time has gone by

757
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,190
people now do want to do Bitcoin

758
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:19,450
transactions and we've reached a point

759
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:24,700
in which the tire size of the block is

760
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:26,919
pull-up this is interesting because it's

761
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:32,460
got statistics in it

762
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:38,650
and you can see how in July 2016 January

763
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:43,210
2017 92 95 percent of the block was

764
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:47,530
filled it's what we've said previously

765
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:50,980
so the Commission's gets higher let's

766
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:53,430
look at Commission's and let's do

767
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,140
another game let's play another game

768
00:44:53,430 --> 00:45:01,330
what we need now are at least three

769
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:03,700
people three people there's a price for

770
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:08,020
this as well and not only that it'll be

771
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:10,419
a price on a wallet on your mobile this

772
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,790
exercise that we told you about that

773
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:15,580
we'd put in a dress with some money and

774
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:18,670
we tried to get it to be robbed by third

775
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:21,790
parties we try to represent it yeah this

776
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:27,850
is the QR code which represents an

777
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:30,610
address where we've put some money don't

778
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:33,040
please show the slide yet because you'll

779
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:36,010
have another QR code which will be the

780
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,779
private password this is what you're

781
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:44,290
gonna have to do the exercise it

782
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:49,720
consists of we're gonna install an app

783
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:52,390
in your mobile those people that come up

784
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:54,220
here will do the exercise together if

785
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:56,500
somebody's got a different model is fine

786
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,629
you don't have to install this and what

787
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:03,460
you're gonna have to do is read this

788
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:07,060
private password import it and then

789
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:09,310
generate an another address and transfer

790
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,890
the money that appears in this address

791
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:15,009
that we've put up there on to your

792
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:16,990
personal address it sounds easy but

793
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:19,440
we're gonna do it with you so that you

794
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:21,669
can see it as you come up

795
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,860
I'll try to convince some people to come

796
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,860
out come on people

797
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,620
bula course I mean by couple there the

798
00:46:49,330 --> 00:47:05,620
rest the people in the audience also can

799
00:46:50,620 --> 00:47:10,750
I take part as well so let's just hope

800
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:12,040
nobody calls that there's a moment we

801
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:19,390
should be able to see what you can see

802
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:22,150
either what we're gonna do is the ice is

803
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:25,330
gonna do it if you don't know how to

804
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:29,530
install a wallet now's the time to do it

805
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:41,279
go to play store those of you they've

806
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:43,720
got an iPhone it's easy let's install it

807
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,130
let's install it there are other wallets

808
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:51,520
you don't have to use this bullet but

809
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:54,300
this is one let's install it's an

810
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,259
open-source software electro

811
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:00,450
installation we're going to open it and

812
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:09,010
the first thing we're going to do is

813
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:18,970
wait until they've got it as well it's a

814
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:22,480
different app for iPhone Jack's J a xx

815
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:27,029
it's a wallet electron is only for

816
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,030
Bitcoin but Jack's is another wallet

817
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:41,848
for other currencies Jed ax jxx anybody

818
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:48,990
else got there a couple of people have

819
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:52,950
raised their hands maybe to imports the

820
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:55,890
privates passwords you can have to skip

821
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:58,549
this bit I said to you earlier that's if

822
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:02,098
you've got a Bitcoin client normally

823
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:07,259
what you do is download the whole of the

824
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:10,410
block but do you didn't have to do that

825
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:16,920
now since the more recent version you

826
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:31,799
can just download to the to final gigas

827
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:34,880
of the block we can use light models you

828
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:37,470
can use jacks or bit Phoenix and

829
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,000
consults the information because for

830
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:43,558
example in your mobile you may not have

831
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,599
enough memory this is the way which

832
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:46,440
systems have of making it more

833
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,299
user-friendly

834
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:55,170
so the first thing we're going to do is

835
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:59,460
generate a standard wallet it's gonna be

836
00:49:55,170 --> 00:50:01,610
your personal address and you're gonna

837
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:04,769
see yeah tha's on the screen

838
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:04,769
[Music]

839
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:31,020
and the axis now going to create a new

840
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:34,890
wallet using a seat so we click on

841
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:38,970
standard and this is how this works

842
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:42,700
d'void happening what happened before

843
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:52,660
you just have a wallet using a series of

844
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:53,790
words and there you can see all the

845
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:58,149
words up there

846
00:50:53,790 --> 00:51:00,900
these works we have to copy them and

847
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:03,790
save them somewhere because we lose them

848
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:08,890
if the mobile it will drop it down the

849
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:11,500
toilet or if a train runs it over or if

850
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:16,150
it just breaks if we don't have those

851
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:19,420
keys these words we're not going to be

852
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:22,140
able to recover the bitcoins that we've

853
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,140
got in the wallet

854
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,159
[Music]

855
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:17,319
[Laughter]

856
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,519
[Music]

857
00:52:50,160 --> 00:53:24,210
see here what we're doing is forcing you

858
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:27,390
in the case of Jax it's not so difficult

859
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,390
you done

860
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:36,310
josè those of you that they want to use

861
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:41,530
Jax's j ax x in this case we've been

862
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:47,410
forced to use this different one at

863
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:49,560
different approaches yeah this is taking

864
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,560
a while

865
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:08,130
with this seat every time we need need a

866
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:12,230
new password it's gonna be generated

867
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:12,230
using all those words that are up there

868
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,730
[Music]

869
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:25,350
think brightest

870
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:37,049
so that instead of you just importing

871
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,160
these passwords there's another way you

872
00:54:37,049 --> 00:54:43,920
can do it that's why we're doing it like

873
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:47,819
this now you're gonna be told yes it

874
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,549
coincides so next I had last you for a

875
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:52,579
PIN number yeah so create yourself a PIN

876
00:54:50,549 --> 00:54:52,579
number

877
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:09,180
hide first making it difficult

878
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:13,530
Philippines I remember your PIN other is

879
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:15,299
gonna have the same problem and now we

880
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:22,549
keep the password so you're being

881
00:55:15,299 --> 00:55:27,359
generated if we want to if the item

882
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:29,400
wants to charge us for this bottle she

883
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,069
can say to us okay I'll keep you this

884
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:42,299
bottle if you transfer to this address

885
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:45,808
one Bitcoin it's a cheap bottle so we'd

886
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:48,900
have to write down this address and then

887
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:51,450
transfer so well here we've got a whole

888
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:54,690
set of addresses and those have you got

889
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:56,819
the jacks app we'll see it differently

890
00:55:54,690 --> 00:56:05,190
so what we gonna do now we're gonna show

891
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:07,920
you on the right the secret or private

892
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:11,789
care so stated to this bitcoin address

893
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:15,630
so you have to scan the QR code in to

894
00:56:11,789 --> 00:56:20,569
import it there's probably a part in the

895
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:20,569
app which says import private keys

896
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:53,410
I'm trying to do it as well okay we're

897
00:56:49,780 --> 00:57:00,340
gonna go back and you can see where we

898
00:56:53,410 --> 00:57:48,310
are I'm going to show you now how to

899
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:51,760
import a QR code let's repeat and show

900
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:55,390
you how to do it again we'll open

901
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:58,800
electrum and you see all wallets are

902
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:05,410
similar to this is just to import keys

903
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:07,390
keys that are written in QR code there

904
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:10,899
you can see the three bullet points and

905
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:14,379
wallet and there we go we click on the

906
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:19,800
new wallet here we're gonna give the

907
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:19,800
wallet a name cyber camp in this case

908
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:30,800
and here you can see import Bitcoin and

909
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:41,390
address or private key you have to write

910
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:49,480
it in let's go back to the presentation

911
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:55,910
now so what we're gonna do now and there

912
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:57,920
you can see their private key anybody in

913
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:08,480
the public if you can import it before

914
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:11,150
you should be able to you got it and

915
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:15,230
anybody was looking at this the quickest

916
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:17,240
of the quick can get the money that's

917
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:22,040
associated with this private key and

918
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:24,379
take it into their wallet the quickest

919
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:28,430
one will be able to have control over

920
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:30,170
the money and as we're sharing this with

921
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:33,560
many people there can be many people who

922
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:40,660
are simultaneously taking the money in

923
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:40,660
theory you should have a QR reader

924
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:54,170
that's another option there are just

925
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:57,379
different examples what we'd want you to

926
00:59:54,170 --> 01:00:00,440
see where this is that anybody now could

927
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:04,220
be taking the money that's in this

928
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:09,940
address they'll give them five more

929
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:15,109
seconds and let's see if there's any

930
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:18,930
transaction in plop chain dot info and

931
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:21,240
see if somebody's stolen it there you go

932
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:27,450
it's the person here that that did the

933
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:41,009
transfer look at your address is that

934
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:46,109
you it may well be you that is we've got

935
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:49,650
the transactions are unconfirmed but it

936
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:51,598
hasn't been added to the blockchain do

937
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:56,539
you have that address is that your

938
01:00:51,599 --> 01:01:00,510
address 18 it may well be that it's you

939
01:00:56,539 --> 01:01:03,270
yeah we transferred naught point naught

940
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:06,660
naught you want and it's ended up in

941
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:09,930
naught point naught naught 65 so almost

942
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:22,440
30% spawn in the Commissioner so what

943
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:25,308
we're trying to show you with this carry

944
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:28,650
on with exercise what we've done is

945
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:31,589
simultaneously and it may well be that

946
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:34,020
somebody else has carried out two or

947
01:01:31,589 --> 01:01:36,480
three transactions of the same money and

948
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:40,650
they're trying to move the money all at

949
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:43,500
the same time now let's go back to this

950
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:47,760
slide we said that the size of the

951
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:51,210
blockchain and of the blocks it was too

952
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:55,470
much so the Bitcoin community says what

953
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:58,770
can we do if we are paying commissions

954
01:01:55,470 --> 01:02:00,839
of five dollars this is not competitive

955
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:02,819
and people are going to use other crypto

956
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:07,078
currencies so we have to take a decision

957
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:09,960
and all the forks that are we seeing

958
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:13,410
here from this Bitcoin project

959
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:15,690
emerge so in these systems we have the

960
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:18,240
heart folks and the soft Forks part

961
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:20,190
Forks what are they a change of the

962
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:25,399
initial protocol there is a change in

963
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:30,370
which in the Bitcoin protocol until now

964
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:32,890
since 2009 to 2017 the bid going

965
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:38,259
community has had rules by consensus

966
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:44,200
socially accepted by all so from the

967
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:47,080
first hop to and block from one to end

968
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:50,140
they follow the same rules one mega for

969
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:52,120
your block for a block but then are the

970
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:54,990
people in the community saying well one

971
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:58,330
mega they pay $8 commission that's a lot

972
01:02:54,990 --> 01:03:01,779
we have to enlarge the size of the block

973
01:02:58,330 --> 01:03:07,120
from one mega to eight Megas for more

974
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:10,930
transactions and lower prices so the

975
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:17,220
Bitcoin system is in parallel we have

976
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:19,990
Bitcoin cash with a size of 8 mega

977
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:22,839
people decide to keep the philosophy of

978
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:28,390
1 mega per block following the original

979
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:33,130
protocol what most people do so the

980
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:36,190
Bitcoin part it's in yellow this is a

981
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:40,330
blockchain and another one these people

982
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:45,730
decide to enlarge the block size to 8

983
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:49,060
Megas so it's another blockchain so from

984
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:51,340
the new block chain there's new and

985
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:54,670
other projects emerging like Bitcoin

986
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:58,300
cult but what happens there's another

987
01:03:54,670 --> 01:04:01,150
change in the rules communities says one

988
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,830
part of the Bitcoin community says the

989
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:07,120
problem is that control is in the hands

990
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:09,430
of minors they are in China all over the

991
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:12,400
place in many places they have a power

992
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:14,529
and it's not democratic because those

993
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,510
who have more computational capacity say

994
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:18,340
for all the transactions to be inserted

995
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,530
they have a power over economy people

996
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:24,040
say I'm going to invent my own algorithm

997
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:28,240
to go back to the philosophy the

998
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:31,420
original philosophy of sakamoto and it's

999
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:35,589
one person one vote and Bitcoin in gold

1000
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:39,880
has been created in this case

1001
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:43,719
it's the blue chain in this case those

1002
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:47,619
we have bitcoins again that were bought

1003
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:48,369
here on the Left they have the bitcoins

1004
01:04:47,619 --> 01:04:50,799
up on top

1005
01:04:48,369 --> 01:04:53,410
they have Bitcoin cash and they had one

1006
01:04:50,799 --> 01:05:00,189
Bitcoin gold the bitcoins that we've

1007
01:04:53,410 --> 01:05:02,578
seen in the wallet I had in 2012 and - -

1008
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:06,038
that was a time with the original

1009
01:05:02,579 --> 01:05:10,239
blockchain you can spend it in the

1010
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:14,140
general Bitcoin chain you could spend it

1011
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:16,299
on a yellow you can spend this in the

1012
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:18,939
green ones as Bitcoin cash and you can

1013
01:05:16,299 --> 01:05:20,859
spend it in the blue as Bitcoin gold but

1014
01:05:18,939 --> 01:05:24,549
I have three ways of spending the same

1015
01:05:20,859 --> 01:05:28,598
bitcoins but it doesn't mean that people

1016
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:30,969
having the Bitcoin cash have at the same

1017
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:36,279
time Bitcoin gold if I'm paid in Bitcoin

1018
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:38,499
cash here and +4 I'll come after the

1019
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:43,329
fork I can't spend it in normal bitcoins

1020
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:46,269
anymore I'm in this this chain only some

1021
01:05:43,329 --> 01:05:51,969
situations when we assess the value of a

1022
01:05:46,269 --> 01:05:55,808
Bitcoin wallet in 2014 the worst that

1023
01:05:51,969 --> 01:05:57,640
was before the the fork but if you have

1024
01:05:55,809 --> 01:06:00,759
several chains you have different type

1025
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:08,529
of types of bitcoins you can earn a lot

1026
01:06:00,759 --> 01:06:11,229
of money the other soft Forks do what

1027
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:14,289
the old one the other ones were hard

1028
01:06:11,229 --> 01:06:18,839
folks these new functionalities that are

1029
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:23,229
added to this system as an example of

1030
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:26,850
soft Forks the multi signature wallets a

1031
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:32,960
functionality that was created in 2013

1032
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:35,100
which you need at least some people

1033
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:39,030
belonging to this bullet to move your

1034
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:40,290
money out it's a soft for support

1035
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:44,790
because that should change in the

1036
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:49,460
functionality this currency but it's a

1037
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:53,460
change that is compatible with the hubs

1038
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:55,680
backwards block chains are not totally

1039
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:58,980
different in the previous case if one

1040
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:02,040
hub generates a block of free Megas in

1041
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:04,380
the Bitcoin blockchain it's going to be

1042
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:06,600
accepted difficult it's one it's too

1043
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:10,560
much it's more than one mega these are

1044
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:13,770
soft thoughts new functionalities new

1045
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:16,200
functionalities in this case multi

1046
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:19,259
signature addresses didn't exist in the

1047
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:24,689
concept of the original concert by

1048
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:30,680
Nakamoto it came later on and there is a

1049
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:33,720
map of currencies called web as my coins

1050
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:39,440
but it's not being updated but it's

1051
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:43,879
quite interesting here we see since 2008

1052
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,880
these are the different implementations

1053
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:52,310
we can see it from the beginning there's

1054
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:52,310
an explanation of what this is

1055
01:07:55,170 --> 01:08:04,500
the first for this NMC namecoin

1056
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:07,620
here you see subdivisions new

1057
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:10,800
implementations of the original source

1058
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:14,130
code code instead of ten Megas for ten

1059
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:17,580
minutes it's very fine five minutes or

1060
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:20,160
instead of using an algorithm for proof

1061
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:22,529
of work they use another algorithm does

1062
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:26,069
happening with lip going and the tree is

1063
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:31,259
growing and it trees growing and grows

1064
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:33,660
more and more so after this

1065
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:37,860
implementation so there's a nuance to it

1066
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:40,500
to each implementation hundred thousand

1067
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:44,639
hundred one hundred six seventy seven so

1068
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:47,760
a lot of them with his Forks this is

1069
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:50,400
another website if you really like this

1070
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:54,020
you want to monitor the price price of

1071
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:57,299
each currency and how much it costs in

1072
01:08:54,020 --> 01:09:01,920
comparison with other currencies you can

1073
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:08,520
use this this website to compare the

1074
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:14,490
currencies rates so now it's going up

1075
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:17,460
the price is going up after our talk an

1076
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:27,410
hour ago it was less than that and here

1077
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:27,410
we see a hundred we will yep view all

1078
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:35,430
some of them have strange names I don't

1079
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:39,210
want to point at anyone because maybe

1080
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:42,810
you are the authors but you go down and

1081
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:45,180
down how many are they how many a

1082
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:49,679
thousand a thousand and three hundred

1083
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:54,290
eighteen these are not all of them

1084
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,290
we can have projects with more than this

1085
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:03,409
tattoo coin that's another one what is

1086
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:07,230
the philosophy of tatto poin I wonder

1087
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:13,589
it's a reference point so we've spoken

1088
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:15,629
about the mining costs it's not very

1089
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:24,120
cost-effective it's not very profitable

1090
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:28,170
to mine anymore for us in 2012 in BC it

1091
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:32,130
could generate well PC like mine could

1092
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:38,280
generate 20 million hash per second its

1093
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:39,949
millions and millions that you need it

1094
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:41,880
was a very small part of the

1095
01:10:39,949 --> 01:10:45,030
computational capacity of the network

1096
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:48,900
now it's growing now this is has been

1097
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:52,259
divided by 600,000 it's a Terra or

1098
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:57,120
something figures are so big sizes are

1099
01:10:52,260 --> 01:11:01,469
so big so we normally in the mining was

1100
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:06,559
done with graphic cards but now you have

1101
01:11:01,469 --> 01:11:09,360
ad ad hoc chips we have experts that

1102
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:12,330
solve the mathematical problems in the

1103
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,170
whole world so that energy consumption

1104
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:16,080
is brutal

1105
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:20,360
it's huge so these are statistics that

1106
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:25,110
were published recently the countries

1107
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:27,199
that spend spent less energy than the

1108
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:31,969
energy needed for the Bitcoin network

1109
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:31,969
159 regions or countries in the world

1110
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:38,640
159 countries that consume less energy

1111
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:42,360
annually then Bitcoin energy needs for

1112
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:44,190
mining small countries well that's an

1113
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:47,759
anecdote for two other cases are quite

1114
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:52,290
significant so what would you do

1115
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:54,540
well what about malicious age and you

1116
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:57,239
they don't want to spend their energy so

1117
01:11:54,540 --> 01:12:00,389
instead I will develop malware so that

1118
01:11:57,239 --> 01:12:02,879
others mind instead of me on my behalf

1119
01:12:00,389 --> 01:12:04,280
this is started three six years ago with

1120
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:09,870
this mal

1121
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:12,599
so malware I in fact using you to mine

1122
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:15,989
and your mining on behalf of them no

1123
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:19,530
it's not only stealing credentials bank

1124
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:21,559
accounts and pictures now they still the

1125
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:25,380
capacity to compute your computational

1126
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:28,790
capacity this is a report it was the

1127
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:35,190
checkpoint report on the 13th of

1128
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:39,060
November so the sixth family of malware

1129
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:42,629
and you in the month used to mine or to

1130
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:45,830
ask you to mine is on behalf of them so

1131
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:49,469
the sixth malware family the most

1132
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:54,449
prolific family of malware was related

1133
01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:56,969
to mining it's the checkpoint report how

1134
01:12:54,449 --> 01:13:01,290
do mine how to fine finance you can use

1135
01:12:56,969 --> 01:13:05,219
a small software with dot XA except him

1136
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:08,160
mine in your computer well instead of

1137
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:13,800
looking at ads you can see JavaScript

1138
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:18,210
does a download upload it underneath Co

1139
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:21,090
Co in hive or crypto loot calm they

1140
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:24,570
offer a small library we can click on it

1141
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:27,270
30% commission out of the computational

1142
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:30,139
capacity that you generate with your

1143
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:34,640
browser 30% commission goes to Coen hive

1144
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:34,640
it stipulated in the project

1145
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:45,880
let's have a look at it so javascript

1146
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:49,630
minor do you trust it this is a

1147
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:55,930
JavaScript code that is an embedded in

1148
01:13:49,630 --> 01:14:01,530
website with a high dot mem doc I'm not

1149
01:13:55,930 --> 01:14:04,000
an expert in JavaScript minor prototype

1150
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:06,820
json.parse you can read it

1151
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,070
something is happening there let's have

1152
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:15,489
a look at the next one it's 12 percent

1153
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:25,299
commission in my encrypt aleut do you

1154
01:14:15,489 --> 01:14:33,669
trust this code this is my way let's see

1155
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:37,210
let's see if it's crushes again okay do

1156
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:39,300
you trust this maybe it's optimized I'm

1157
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:42,250
sure of that

1158
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:47,020
this is optimized for an efficient

1159
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:53,170
mining but I can't really see it I can't

1160
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:55,870
debug it really it's more complex this

1161
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:58,480
Cripe dilute and Cohen hive are projects

1162
01:14:55,870 --> 01:15:01,360
that you can see it they have their own

1163
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:04,299
business model this is used in websites

1164
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:08,559
with the underneath JavaScript you can

1165
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:10,870
you use pirates bay or any websites of

1166
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,280
this type why why it was open it was

1167
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:17,800
mine in underneath or behind it

1168
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:24,340
this is extended and you will have these

1169
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:26,560
add-ons browser add-ons so these are the

1170
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:30,540
websites that you're browsing and it's

1171
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:34,960
identifying if there's a code so age

1172
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:37,390
HTTP lock coin block well you have all

1173
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:45,760
the signs appearing all this threats

1174
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:47,860
that we're having this is no coin you

1175
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:50,670
look in chrome store in Firefox you've

1176
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:54,339
had this project also

1177
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:59,890
did hop you see all the pages that are

1178
01:15:54,340 --> 01:16:02,560
being blocked no coin what was the first

1179
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,130
transaction in the real world in Bitcoin

1180
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,350
system

1181
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:12,970
it was the famous pizza you know the

1182
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:15,040
case in May 2010 a user over forum well

1183
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:19,570
you may have an address and an account

1184
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,519
this was a Bitcoin forum last lo was the

1185
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:25,599
name of the user

1186
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:28,920
he set a challenge saying if you bring

1187
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:32,110
me to pizza now to my home I'm going to

1188
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:35,410
offer you 10,000 bitcoins and he put the

1189
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:40,929
photos of the pizza so somebody sends

1190
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:45,210
him the pizza and now well on the 22nd

1191
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:45,210
of May when this transaction was made

1192
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:51,099
its the Bitcoin pizza day and there's a

1193
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:55,000
Twitter account that it's monitoring the

1194
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:58,540
price in dollars of what the.oh of what

1195
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:04,000
this pizza would cost now it's 97

1196
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:06,269
million but pizza so it's 96 million

1197
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,770
dollars now that's the value of that

1198
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:12,700
this is an anecdote it was originally

1199
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:15,550
used as a payment system in order to

1200
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:18,580
avoid the central control of banks we

1201
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:21,880
can use your else here so that you know

1202
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:24,430
you know them local bitcoins calm it's a

1203
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:26,890
site where people who want to buy and

1204
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:29,230
sell bitcoins can meet physically and

1205
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:33,730
transfer those bitcoins but the platform

1206
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:38,769
here will charge us a commission for

1207
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:43,089
having these two people meet meeting

1208
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:48,100
really and then coin map dough or here

1209
01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:49,540
coin map we haven't looked at this here

1210
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:51,340
in Santander but there's one in Madrid

1211
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:57,660
II if you want to buy you can choose

1212
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:59,760
Spain online offers online offers I

1213
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:10,710
can't see it

1214
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:13,079
here here in person cash let's see do

1215
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:19,650
the search in Spain to see what we can

1216
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:22,018
do in Spain not many of them here in

1217
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:24,480
Madrid another one in Valencia Alicante

1218
01:18:22,019 --> 01:18:28,349
Dania Benidorm here different profiles

1219
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:31,500
different people they want to offer they

1220
01:18:28,349 --> 01:18:34,440
want to buy bitcoins they want to buy

1221
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:36,900
bitcoins or they want to sell because

1222
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:40,619
they meet in person and they can do that

1223
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:44,610
the transfers they can exchange 10

1224
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:46,949
bitcoins or 10 dollars and they can

1225
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:51,949
exchange their currencies another

1226
01:18:46,949 --> 01:18:53,489
website coin mark coin map org coin map

1227
01:18:51,949 --> 01:18:57,799
on this website

1228
01:18:53,489 --> 01:19:00,780
it's a project with different bodies

1229
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:03,210
upload the fact that they are Bitcoin

1230
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:06,900
friendly like they do accept bitcoins or

1231
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:21,300
other cryptocurrencies let's see the map

1232
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:27,629
who accepts bitcoins see if there's

1233
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:32,760
something in Santander the several shops

1234
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:38,159
images here a couple of dots I don't

1235
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:41,670
know if we can show them or not in some

1236
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:45,268
of these dots they say they do accept

1237
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:48,469
bitcoins in Madrid the quite a number

1238
01:19:45,269 --> 01:19:52,980
especially in the centre of the city

1239
01:19:48,469 --> 01:19:54,510
it depends on the adoption level then

1240
01:19:52,980 --> 01:20:00,000
you can see where you can spend your

1241
01:19:54,510 --> 01:20:05,369
bitcoins in physical shops and stores so

1242
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:07,639
this is coin map and local bitcoins well

1243
01:20:05,369 --> 01:20:10,920
it's kind of different type of platforms

1244
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:13,650
as you may know this can be used in the

1245
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:16,000
blockchain to transfer money

1246
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:18,339
we're the beacon system but sometimes

1247
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,570
it's interesting to include information

1248
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:26,200
for this a transaction is shown like

1249
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:29,740
this is viewed like this but in 2013

1250
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:32,860
there's a new functionality you can use

1251
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:36,460
opera tour that's the code in Opera

1252
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:41,490
return you can put 80 bytes of

1253
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:44,010
information here an example very typical

1254
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:49,240
Charlie Lowe's Haiti

1255
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:54,010
it's the instead of storing or saving a

1256
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:57,490
transfer you can add an exit instead of

1257
01:20:54,010 --> 01:21:00,760
making this monetary exchange you can

1258
01:20:57,490 --> 01:21:03,880
put 30 bytes that was before 2013 but it

1259
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:08,680
was made official in with open-open

1260
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:14,470
returned with 80 bytes that you can use

1261
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:20,890
in the blockchain so on this is to

1262
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:23,860
include information because we take

1263
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:26,620
advantage of the Bitcoin blockchain it's

1264
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:30,130
distributed in on many Internet nodes

1265
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:33,000
that keep a copy that save a copy so if

1266
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:38,680
we can embed some information some data

1267
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:41,080
what people are thinking evil but also

1268
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:45,190
it's for good for that at the same time

1269
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:50,340
this in this platform we can see in real

1270
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:55,469
time the information in the open return

1271
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:55,470
this is omniscience it's a protocol that

1272
01:21:55,890 --> 01:22:03,400
it implements a new functionality with

1273
01:21:58,930 --> 01:22:07,870
open return ok return to save and store

1274
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:12,599
some specific information these these

1275
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:12,599
are data what they are sending

1276
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:20,940
most of the projects now you're seeing

1277
01:22:16,510 --> 01:22:25,780
in the media for blockchain in most

1278
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:33,250
using open return for the time stand of

1279
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:34,809
the documents or sign in time we know

1280
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:39,940
that it's going to be there because this

1281
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:43,020
protocol is being developed to stay so

1282
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:47,379
it's very difficult to find a single

1283
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:50,860
failures failure point but now you have

1284
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:53,560
a guarantee not only it's there you can

1285
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:55,900
have it in other social media but it's

1286
01:22:53,560 --> 01:23:00,010
there and what is there is going to be

1287
01:22:55,900 --> 01:23:04,420
there in the future as long as Bitcoin

1288
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:08,950
exists in the new projects for instance

1289
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:12,990
notary registration this project is

1290
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:14,470
quite similar proof of existence the URL

1291
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:19,960
it's there

1292
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:22,300
you only need to put a document there we

1293
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:24,100
type it and then hash is associated to

1294
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:26,440
that document it's at the identification

1295
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:28,420
number of that document this hash will

1296
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:34,089
would be embedded in the opere return

1297
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:38,470
field and this is kept there so so you

1298
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:40,210
have a book and this is mine book I can

1299
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:42,640
generate a hash of this document of this

1300
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:44,620
book it it enters the blockchain and can

1301
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,910
always say that this is mine I can use

1302
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:50,920
it and say this is in the blockchain

1303
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:55,510
since the 30th of November 2017 at 7:30

1304
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:58,720
and it's mine there's the registration

1305
01:23:55,510 --> 01:24:00,850
is there one bit is modified the next

1306
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:04,180
blocks would have been different but at

1307
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:09,690
least you can anchor that information

1308
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:12,280
and guarantee it it's proof of existence

1309
01:24:09,690 --> 01:24:17,179
so

1310
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:20,599
this could be used for that so before

1311
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:23,570
the command and control the command and

1312
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:25,910
control and the tools that you malware

1313
01:24:23,570 --> 01:24:27,969
uses to be in contact between the

1314
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:31,250
victims and the administrator

1315
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:33,800
well the infected notes that belong to a

1316
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:36,740
network once it's centralized the

1317
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:41,840
victims have no communication on this

1318
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:47,809
system with our IRC chat so it was the

1319
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:50,630
same in 28 2008 etc well you know our

1320
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:53,990
see charts maybe it's not that common in

1321
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:57,410
web servers and now this is happening in

1322
01:24:53,990 --> 01:25:00,110
social media but the specificity of

1323
01:24:57,410 --> 01:25:03,580
social media is that that will always be

1324
01:25:00,110 --> 01:25:06,980
there like this case was quite

1325
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:11,690
well-known in the social media the the

1326
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:15,200
malware author O's used the command and

1327
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:17,530
cone control in Instagram see if they

1328
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:22,190
find it in Instagram everything

1329
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:24,110
disappears so if Instagram crashes and

1330
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:27,530
it a this is the Britney Spears

1331
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:30,410
profiling if it Instagram crashes it's

1332
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:32,509
the end so Instagram is not going to

1333
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:34,550
crash so I'm going to put comments on

1334
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:37,580
the photos and be given by Britney

1335
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:39,650
Spears and I'm gonna send with the

1336
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:41,180
strange method which is quite difficult

1337
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:43,580
to understand I'm gonna send the

1338
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:47,890
information to which the victims have to

1339
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:47,890
connect to find find command and control

1340
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:57,680
so it wasn't the URL it there it's a

1341
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:59,150
religious system with a comment it takes

1342
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:03,500
the same the first character of each

1343
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:06,259
word and generated the the bitly address

1344
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,690
the Britney Spears address why because

1345
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:12,950
he wanted to find a site that was very

1346
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:15,650
very solid and they couldn't crash so

1347
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:20,459
we've seen it in command and control but

1348
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:26,879
also for social advertising of the ISIS

1349
01:26:20,459 --> 01:26:29,309
Islamic states I and we found an

1350
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:32,789
extension that was distributing these

1351
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:35,670
Isis propaganda to all the people that

1352
01:26:32,789 --> 01:26:37,499
could be radicalized and so they sought

1353
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:41,699
the application in a toll moment they

1354
01:26:37,499 --> 01:26:43,260
knew what were the website sites they

1355
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:45,570
had to consult to consume that

1356
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:47,729
information the author of the propaganda

1357
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:49,199
could manage the content of the

1358
01:26:47,729 --> 01:26:51,719
propaganda and there was a server

1359
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:53,549
what would with that it was pointing to

1360
01:26:51,719 --> 01:27:00,780
the websites where the propaganda should

1361
01:26:53,550 --> 01:27:03,689
be present so if next one so if the

1362
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:05,518
propaganda websites crashed and they had

1363
01:27:03,689 --> 01:27:08,670
to get a new website there was an

1364
01:27:05,519 --> 01:27:10,610
automatic notification the user is

1365
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:15,079
transparent text the add-on was

1366
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:19,768
installed already the add-on was there

1367
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:24,630
we can see it now the add-on was this

1368
01:27:19,769 --> 01:27:27,059
had this code very strict stupid code it

1369
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:30,929
doesn't work in Firefox quantum anymore

1370
01:27:27,059 --> 01:27:33,780
so on this service that was the number

1371
01:27:30,929 --> 01:27:36,389
where it's not available anymore but it

1372
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:40,559
was updating the new address on which

1373
01:27:36,389 --> 01:27:43,739
the radicalized content was present so

1374
01:27:40,559 --> 01:27:46,320
there was a an updating of the websites

1375
01:27:43,739 --> 01:27:48,629
that you could see for a radicalized

1376
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:52,768
propaganda so you can update it

1377
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:55,619
automatically with this but if somebody

1378
01:27:52,769 --> 01:27:57,439
identifies that your users is seeing

1379
01:27:55,619 --> 01:28:00,688
this content are using this add-on

1380
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:03,689
instead of throwing away the destination

1381
01:28:00,689 --> 01:28:06,360
pages you can throw away the central

1382
01:28:03,689 --> 01:28:10,110
failure point and the problem for

1383
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:14,880
propaganda was the same they had a

1384
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:20,179
single failure point that could be

1385
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:23,219
controlled and blocked so this could be

1386
01:28:20,179 --> 01:28:26,689
optimum this could be optimized what

1387
01:28:23,219 --> 01:28:29,429
blockchain but no specific goal in

1388
01:28:26,689 --> 01:28:31,979
opinion if we think that English several

1389
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:34,110
years we'll see use case of malware

1390
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:37,440
samples that are anchoring

1391
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:39,179
in this will change my ways and ensuring

1392
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:41,250
itself that this content is going to

1393
01:28:39,179 --> 01:28:44,790
persist and it's going to lock it's

1394
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:47,670
going to last so in the blockchain here

1395
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:50,929
I can use it as a command and control

1396
01:28:47,670 --> 01:28:54,530
and the source code is there in github

1397
01:28:50,929 --> 01:28:57,860
you have it here this is the source code

1398
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:59,730
it's a quite a simple project

1399
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:03,480
requirement fine

1400
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:07,799
Epis time that's all

1401
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:13,500
yeah you have the small software for the

1402
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:17,449
administrator here from two addresses

1403
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:17,449
that are managed by the administrator

1404
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:25,710
we're going to use the testy not to

1405
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:29,070
spend any money and we're not going to

1406
01:29:25,710 --> 01:29:32,580
use bitcoins there so we put the

1407
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:34,820
information that we want inside the OPI

1408
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:40,920
return code and then the victim spot

1409
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:43,949
here they would go to the code that we

1410
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:46,380
have published they're going to download

1411
01:29:43,949 --> 01:29:48,869
download the transaction list and here

1412
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:53,100
there's another example here let's see

1413
01:29:48,869 --> 01:29:56,159
it with an example so it's downloaded

1414
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:58,530
you can do it also it's not just for

1415
01:29:56,159 --> 01:30:03,989
command and control you can anchor any

1416
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:06,599
content we think that this is a

1417
01:30:03,989 --> 01:30:09,830
possibility with you didn't identify

1418
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:12,360
this possibility we've looked for that

1419
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:15,869
malware samples that try to avoid this

1420
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:19,019
behavior we didn't find any maybe they

1421
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:21,089
haven't been detected by big security

1422
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:25,710
companies but we think that this is a

1423
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:28,980
reality it might be happening already so

1424
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:34,219
we go to the admin part admin and this

1425
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:34,218
is a small file here it is

1426
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:48,540
without pushing it's very simple with

1427
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:51,690
console a first question choose the type

1428
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:58,680
of network that you want you can choose

1429
01:30:51,690 --> 01:31:03,929
Bitcoin L it's going and the one we use

1430
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:05,730
for tests is test net buy Bitcoin like

1431
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:08,130
this you don't need money you don't need

1432
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:11,309
real bitcoins you want to transfer any

1433
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:14,640
information not the coins and it has to

1434
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:18,480
be there for a certain time intro and

1435
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:21,840
this the brain or other concept it's

1436
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:24,450
mental wallet we're going to use this

1437
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:28,470
mental wallet for simple operation in

1438
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:31,019
this mental wallet Tosa Bergkamp saber

1439
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:35,640
que saber Camp so have an address and

1440
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:39,740
the private key it starts with M e step

1441
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:43,340
test met by base Bitcoin starts with M

1442
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:51,900
this is the code that represents the

1443
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:55,230
private key test next yes 11 bitcoins in

1444
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:59,570
the test net it's not real bitcoins we

1445
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:59,570
don't want to spend that money and then

1446
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:10,290
notepad dot eggsy now it's asking me

1447
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:14,640
that address that is receiving the money

1448
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:16,350
note by taxi the exit decimal chain and

1449
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:22,440
what is the address you want to send the

1450
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:28,860
money and then we want to anchor the

1451
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:30,419
content there break and then don't need

1452
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:33,809
to have another address

1453
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:35,400
I can resend the money to myself who

1454
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:38,460
don't need to have a new address I'm

1455
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:42,059
generating another address with the same

1456
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:43,920
key the same word have you want its

1457
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:48,150
it's the same that's being generated

1458
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:50,580
with a commission and this is the

1459
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:52,410
transaction that is being signed

1460
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:54,570
what is the aspect of this Bitcoin

1461
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:58,470
transaction this this is a bacon

1462
01:32:54,570 --> 01:33:02,940
transaction you can push it with this

1463
01:32:58,470 --> 01:33:04,890
command chain with dot sock that's the

1464
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:20,940
centralized service or we can ask the

1465
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:24,000
program to push it alone so the push

1466
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:24,780
option and this is going to follow the

1467
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,440
same process

1468
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:32,389
rain rain we choose the key word cyber

1469
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:35,660
can do you have money yes we have money

1470
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:35,660
no too bad

1471
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:49,840
target it's the same use the same cyber

1472
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:54,610
camp okay

1473
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:57,310
Commission 10,000 right effect and

1474
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:58,660
that's it it's pushed it's been

1475
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:03,670
generated it's here

1476
01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:06,820
first now it could be a fake you are

1477
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:11,170
showing it to me in the console go to

1478
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:16,150
Cohen secret coin secret the test net

1479
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:18,160
and here it is yeah it's notified to the

1480
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:22,299
network and there's no information that

1481
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:24,700
we want to anchor is there now there's a

1482
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:27,310
Bitcoin address that has no note part

1483
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:30,760
dot XE that has been anchored what are

1484
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:34,420
we going to do the in the inverse

1485
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:36,730
process this is the victims part it's

1486
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:38,620
implemented in JavaScript because we

1487
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:44,139
made a modification of the previous

1488
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:47,050
add-on so that it could be used as DNS

1489
01:34:44,140 --> 01:34:54,400
resolution to where they are not on and

1490
01:34:47,050 --> 01:35:00,010
this is where the JavaScript okay we're

1491
01:34:54,400 --> 01:35:05,379
gonna run it we're on the test net let's

1492
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:15,370
copy the address this address is the one

1493
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:18,220
that was hacked in nee malware so we

1494
01:35:15,370 --> 01:35:21,280
copy and paste and if we've done it

1495
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:25,480
properly what it'll do is it'll of

1496
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:29,469
consults at the blockchain just to check

1497
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:33,160
that it works we've got the notepad and

1498
01:35:29,470 --> 01:35:35,980
then what we'll do is try it again to

1499
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:38,370
see if we can open the calculator let's

1500
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,370
do it again

1501
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:42,909
[Music]

1502
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:55,810
the advantage is that the content that

1503
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:57,340
we've anchored cannot be modified we're

1504
01:35:55,810 --> 01:35:59,620
always surprised that these solutions

1505
01:35:57,340 --> 01:36:06,090
don't exist yet we'll do it again

1506
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:06,090
and this case we're pushing cyber camp

1507
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:15,490
these are bitcoins in the test net but

1508
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:18,580
there are services that you can get the

1509
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:21,130
bitcoins to carry out your tests you

1510
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:22,630
don't need to get real bitcoins now

1511
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:29,430
we're going to transfer it to the same a

1512
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:37,900
coin then we have to return to test net

1513
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:46,330
you have to wait for a while it takes a

1514
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:51,070
while because the hub may take a while a

1515
01:36:46,330 --> 01:36:53,559
few seconds to be notified let's go to

1516
01:36:51,070 --> 01:37:02,290
the victims you can imagine what's going

1517
01:36:53,560 --> 01:37:05,760
to happen now here you can use this for

1518
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:05,760
example to keep command and control

1519
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:33,340
here's the calculator that's sufficient

1520
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:40,750
for us it but imagine that it was the

1521
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:43,300
central server if the machine doesn't

1522
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:47,830
work we'll get another one we can keep

1523
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:51,340
changing it as a mechanism to avoid

1524
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:56,230
censorship and if you're going to be

1525
01:37:51,340 --> 01:38:01,090
able to access the blockchain you can

1526
01:37:56,230 --> 01:38:07,179
use these kinds of platforms but these

1527
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:09,190
kinds of platforms are limited to 80

1528
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:11,080
bytes of information but there are other

1529
01:38:09,190 --> 01:38:14,259
options if you combine it with our

1530
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:20,580
technology and the technology that's

1531
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:26,050
using is ipfs it's another p2p Network

1532
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:30,309
but what you can do is anchor where the

1533
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:32,530
information is being stored here let's

1534
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:34,060
imagine we want to anchor all of this

1535
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:38,230
content and it's there's more than 80

1536
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:42,970
bytes here it's just an example we've

1537
01:38:38,230 --> 01:38:49,769
got a pointer which is all this for this

1538
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:57,730
address it's not a C bytes though and

1539
01:38:49,770 --> 01:39:02,560
you link to torrents and with this put

1540
01:38:57,730 --> 01:39:05,769
the point in the right place and what we

1541
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:15,340
can do is unload it from platforms such

1542
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:19,390
as IP FS o RG that's one option this you

1543
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:25,330
can use to keep pictures if you can't

1544
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:29,620
anchor the picture in the blockchain you

1545
01:39:25,330 --> 01:39:32,439
can have a pointer and this technology

1546
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:37,059
has been used

1547
01:39:32,439 --> 01:39:39,459
he used in the 1st of October referendum

1548
01:39:37,059 --> 01:39:45,489
in Catalonia it was used to avoid

1549
01:39:39,459 --> 01:39:50,260
censorship he they were blocking access

1550
01:39:45,489 --> 01:39:51,669
to certain web sites of the government

1551
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:53,800
and so what they did was link it to

1552
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:57,969
other of these kinds these kinds of

1553
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:59,889
places these things exist and we need to

1554
01:39:57,969 --> 01:40:04,090
know that they're within everybody's

1555
01:39:59,889 --> 01:40:09,659
reach and it's a solution that's

1556
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:16,599
traceable other great things in namecoin

1557
01:40:09,659 --> 01:40:22,018
this was the first form of Bitcoin now I

1558
01:40:16,599 --> 01:40:30,929
can store 512 20 information guides and

1559
01:40:22,019 --> 01:40:30,929
there's an ad on what a browser ads on

1560
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:44,650
namecoin name chain info is like a

1561
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:51,629
Bitcoin info but it's just with name

1562
01:40:44,650 --> 01:40:57,489
chain our personal domain is calm but

1563
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:59,979
here we can in the blockchain

1564
01:40:57,489 --> 01:41:06,638
here of name coin stored in this

1565
01:40:59,979 --> 01:41:11,829
structure for eyepiece if I sit say to

1566
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:13,749
you and you see oh this is a bit and it

1567
01:41:11,829 --> 01:41:16,719
may be something in name coins and you

1568
01:41:13,749 --> 01:41:19,059
can see the information that unit and

1569
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:20,469
the IP address that you need to

1570
01:41:19,059 --> 01:41:23,519
connector to get the information it's

1571
01:41:20,469 --> 01:41:23,519
just in a different format

1572
01:41:28,099 --> 01:41:34,550
you could have beat the whole block

1573
01:41:31,769 --> 01:41:38,239
chains of namecoin there another

1574
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:44,369
interesting project is aetherium

1575
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:52,018
etherium is another platform but it's

1576
01:41:44,369 --> 01:41:54,509
also a crypto currency and what makes it

1577
01:41:52,019 --> 01:41:58,199
different to Bitcoin is that you can D

1578
01:41:54,510 --> 01:42:02,669
anchor certain smart contracts little

1579
01:41:58,199 --> 01:42:05,789
programs that you can say o run when

1580
01:42:02,669 --> 01:42:08,969
this option is chosen or do this when

1581
01:42:05,789 --> 01:42:20,518
it's finished instead of storing

1582
01:42:08,969 --> 01:42:24,260
information they're little programs if

1583
01:42:20,519 --> 01:42:29,189
their programs you can sometimes

1584
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:39,539
validate them incorrectly in this year

1585
01:42:29,189 --> 01:42:46,709
in Def Con there was a talk just on this

1586
01:42:39,539 --> 01:42:52,739
about security in aetherium they've been

1587
01:42:46,709 --> 01:42:57,389
at least two cases of smart contracts

1588
01:42:52,739 --> 01:43:03,058
which gone completely wrong and just to

1589
01:42:57,389 --> 01:43:05,719
show you a little bit about the

1590
01:43:03,059 --> 01:43:05,719
technology

1591
01:43:07,449 --> 01:43:18,910
with the Madrid passer match last year

1592
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:23,170
we did a smart contract a we usually do

1593
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:29,370
pool and letters instead of physically

1594
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:32,770
having to put two euros yet to put two

1595
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:36,540
euros it's a real us and one in a

1596
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:42,219
theorems so it was like the normal

1597
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:45,820
collector and whip-round and that was a

1598
01:43:42,219 --> 01:43:55,960
way of giving people the opportunity to

1599
01:43:45,820 --> 01:44:06,040
take part so they put the results in

1600
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:11,800
there once the match had finished you

1601
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:19,660
could pay people out and then we've

1602
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:22,600
forecast the user could say to the

1603
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:27,420
contract I think it's gonna be zero zero

1604
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:29,949
three three so when the game finished

1605
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:34,510
the administrator was the person that

1606
01:44:29,949 --> 01:44:39,250
had signed the contract said okay the

1607
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:44,320
result was three three and then you pay

1608
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:48,880
the winner automatically what the code

1609
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:50,410
does is check whether results had been

1610
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,670
typed in and whether the person that

1611
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:56,620
type hidden' was the organizer

1612
01:44:51,670 --> 01:45:00,040
administrator because if he didn't if it

1613
01:44:56,620 --> 01:45:04,030
didn't do this check anybody could have

1614
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:06,790
run the contract so we divided it up we

1615
01:45:04,030 --> 01:45:08,800
tried to see who'd won if there'd been

1616
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:11,850
two winners we divided it between two

1617
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,850
the three three

1618
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:21,309
another interesting thing would have

1619
01:45:16,150 --> 01:45:23,920
been automatically to consult the web

1620
01:45:21,310 --> 01:45:29,370
and their projects now with Airlines

1621
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:34,390
without a trying to use smart contracts

1622
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:38,470
for example if you if the flight comes

1623
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:42,100
in late you can automatically return the

1624
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:49,360
money that their user actually has paid

1625
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:55,810
for their flight there are lots of use

1626
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:59,049
cases and with blockchain it's all

1627
01:45:55,810 --> 01:46:02,050
related to supply chains imagine what we

1628
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:07,870
manufacture cars and each part of the

1629
01:46:02,050 --> 01:46:10,540
car goes through a different process and

1630
01:46:07,870 --> 01:46:12,099
for example I get a part and it's

1631
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:16,420
perfectly fine

1632
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:22,330
the aim is if you get a part that it's

1633
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:26,740
got a defect in it you can find out

1634
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:29,890
where it's where the chains failed so as

1635
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:33,690
to be able to find out whether something

1636
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:37,900
belongs to you or not that's digital

1637
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:42,370
property ownership proof of existence

1638
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:45,009
you anchor our hash to a document but if

1639
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:49,300
you've got to anchor 1000 documents and

1640
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:51,730
it's different they're all very powerful

1641
01:46:49,300 --> 01:46:55,800
and just anchoring a one has tacky you

1642
01:46:51,730 --> 01:46:55,799
can guarantee that a document

1643
01:46:58,810 --> 01:47:05,329
you do need a thousand transactions

1644
01:47:03,099 --> 01:47:08,360
there are startups that just do that

1645
01:47:05,329 --> 01:47:15,380
then smart contracts that we mentioned

1646
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:18,250
before and provide security to digital

1647
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:27,020
identity and the Internet of Things and

1648
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:29,800
to finish the I SEOs initial coin

1649
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:34,989
offerings have you ever heard of them

1650
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:39,889
Aiko's is a new way of funding that many

1651
01:47:34,989 --> 01:47:42,799
organizers have found what they do they

1652
01:47:39,889 --> 01:47:46,630
print they have tokens distribute

1653
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:50,989
amongst those who originally in the

1654
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:53,630
project and they get economic advantage

1655
01:47:50,989 --> 01:47:57,829
so if the project is a good one and it

1656
01:47:53,630 --> 01:48:02,650
is attractive these people that invested

1657
01:47:57,829 --> 01:48:02,650
at the start gets us a profit imagine

1658
01:48:02,739 --> 01:48:16,549
that instead of using this kind of

1659
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:22,099
project we want to fund people with wiki

1660
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:26,260
starters and go to here you can do it of

1661
01:48:22,099 --> 01:48:30,020
having an intermediary some countries

1662
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:36,139
concerned about this in China they're

1663
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:40,099
very very concerned because here there's

1664
01:48:36,139 --> 01:48:41,840
not some many means of controlling that

1665
01:48:40,099 --> 01:48:43,369
actually what they say they're going to

1666
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:46,159
do they actually do do and how people

1667
01:48:43,369 --> 01:48:51,829
are managing the money if in the real

1668
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:56,869
world we have problems imagine if you

1669
01:48:51,829 --> 01:49:00,058
remove all the security measures and you

1670
01:48:56,869 --> 01:49:04,019
get into the digital world

1671
01:49:00,059 --> 01:49:08,489
so you have to be careful you have to be

1672
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:11,159
very careful tiptoe around things and

1673
01:49:08,489 --> 01:49:12,539
let's go back to the metaphor that we

1674
01:49:11,159 --> 01:49:17,789
started the talk with it which is

1675
01:49:12,539 --> 01:49:22,889
Schrodinger's cat in this experiment if

1676
01:49:17,789 --> 01:49:28,739
you're outside the bunker the cats may

1677
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:30,719
be alive and it may be dead what you

1678
01:49:28,739 --> 01:49:35,610
have to take away from this talk is that

1679
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:37,800
sometimes you can try out all different

1680
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:39,598
solutions that's just blockchain etc now

1681
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,590
they're using blockchain for everything

1682
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:44,070
but doesn't have to be used for

1683
01:49:40,590 --> 01:49:46,440
everything it's why what I mean is like

1684
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:47,610
the cat doesn't have to be alive and at

1685
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:53,009
the same time you always have to use

1686
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:54,480
blockchain because if your project has

1687
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:59,809
the characteristics that require

1688
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:59,808
blockchain and if they're persistent

1689
01:50:00,170 --> 01:50:07,099
because information is replicated in all

1690
01:50:03,059 --> 01:50:09,949
the networks have traceability you know

1691
01:50:07,099 --> 01:50:14,550
where your project is at a given moment

1692
01:50:09,949 --> 01:50:18,210
in time information is that's a

1693
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:20,250
tremendous integrity you can't go back

1694
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:23,489
and change any of the bytes and that you

1695
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:25,650
do away with intermediaries what you're

1696
01:50:23,489 --> 01:50:28,440
doing for example the smart contracts is

1697
01:50:25,650 --> 01:50:30,089
trying to do away with any kind of

1698
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:32,070
intermediaries and if you don't have

1699
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:37,469
these characteristics probably

1700
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:38,940
blockchain isn't what you need that's a

1701
01:50:37,469 --> 01:50:42,389
conclusion we're trying to draw from

1702
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:44,009
this we're not saying blockchain should

1703
01:50:42,389 --> 01:50:47,480
be used just for the sake of it but

1704
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:49,889
rather blockchain because one of the

1705
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:57,629
requisite requirements that are up there

1706
01:50:49,889 --> 01:51:00,469
are met we remember in a meeting people

1707
01:50:57,630 --> 01:51:00,469
started saying Oh

1708
01:51:01,229 --> 01:51:08,130
if you can't tell me why I shouldn't use

1709
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:11,518
a CSV for this project maybe block the

1710
01:51:08,130 --> 01:51:13,469
Chinese at the solution maybe we're

1711
01:51:11,519 --> 01:51:15,479
getting we're making our lives too

1712
01:51:13,469 --> 01:51:18,659
complicated okay

1713
01:51:15,479 --> 01:51:21,389
I hope you enjoyed their presentation I

1714
01:51:18,659 --> 01:51:22,829
hope you've understood a little bit more

1715
01:51:21,389 --> 01:51:25,650
about the world of Bitcoin and

1716
01:51:22,829 --> 01:51:29,179
blockchain but if you have any questions

1717
01:51:25,650 --> 01:51:30,799
here we are to us answer them thank you

1718
01:51:29,179 --> 01:51:37,970
thank you

1719
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:37,970
[Applause]

1720
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:44,599
you
