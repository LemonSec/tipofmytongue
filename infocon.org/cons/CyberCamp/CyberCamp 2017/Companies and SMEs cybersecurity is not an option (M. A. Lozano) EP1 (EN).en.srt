00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:11,030
related to the risk subject to SMEs or

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:16,960
micro companies with a very simple

14
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:21,920
concept so we can see how cyber

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,589
criminals can deceive us and it's very

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,609
easy for them I will just make a very

17
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:33,409
simple demonstration so to show how

18
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:36,350
cyber criminals works first do you have

19
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:41,560
a credit card any of you do you have

20
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,559
just a simple credit card or debit card

21
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,009
just a banker god

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,420
this can you tell me your PIN code

23
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:02,070
please no don't tell me your PIN code

24
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:07,830
I'm sorry it was just a joke

25
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:10,799
I always thought with this anecdote

26
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,760
because you are the audience

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:19,110
I am the speaker and you trust me and

28
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:22,350
this can be used in Internet by

29
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,590
cybercriminals now please I wanted you

30
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:29,310

become more complicated later please

34
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,320

35
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:47,130

48
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,690
each owner

49
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:41,290
of all of us we small number of people

50
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:45,310
have succeeded we all know more about

51
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:49,660
cybersecurity to use it in our daily

52
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:54,040
life but in companies we don't use this

53
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:57,340
knowledge why we might think that this

54
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,070
is a totally different environment we

55
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,680
separate our professional from the

56
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:08,980
personal domains but we should add bells

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:13,630
when we are in a bar with our friends

58
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:16,630
and we carry out a small talk but we

59
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:19,000
never speak about cybersecurity how many

60
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:23,230
of you went adjust when to have a drink

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,930
and you see that your friends when they

62
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,330
are unblocking their smartphone they do

63
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,070
not have a passion and unblocking

64
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,750
partner how many of you have asked this

65
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:41,320
question of all of you very few so we

66
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:43,720
have to disseminate the concept of cyber

67
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,469
Security's of the dis present in all

68
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:51,220
environments and following my

69
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:55,210
presentation I like to speak about the

70
00:04:51,220 --> 00:05:00,400
past 25 or 30 years ago this was the

71
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:03,520
type of criminal with this look with the

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,940
heart and he or she had to go to the

73
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:12,760
physical place she commits the crime

74
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:16,770
whether to a bank or jewelry shop and

75
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:20,170
those are their headlines it was a

76
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,479
robbery at a gas station they kidnapped

77
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:26,530
a person those were the type of common

78
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:31,150
crimes 25 or 30 years ago now we have a

79
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,429
new format of Agri criminal even though

80
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,729
the old ones are still present but now

81
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:40,240
we have cyber criminals they work in a

82
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:43,509
global context they work in Internet

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:48,610
and they do not need to be physically

84
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:51,880
present in any given place what is even

85
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:55,060
more worrying is that the needs the

86
00:05:51,880 --> 00:06:00,699
tools he or she uses are very economical

87
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:03,250
a computer tablet the laptop you see

88
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:06,960
literally and then he or she will have

89
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:11,919
the possibility of anonymity that is

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:15,190
present in internet but Internet not

91
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,849
everything is taken for granted that we

92
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,880
have to say so things have changed now

93
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:24,789
there are more headlines related to

94
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,199
cyber attacks than to conventional

95
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:31,810
crimes and also all information related

96
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,130
to cyber security and the media will be

97
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:41,169
more and more interlinked when we see

98
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:44,110
the famous statements from political

99
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:49,120
leaders or well-known people that can

100
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:51,190
only blame their statements to the fact

101
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,340
that their account had been hacked we

102
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:58,630
have four main devices information

103
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:01,869
people computers and devices everything

104
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:04,650
was very controlled in the 80s we have

105
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,650
the coming of technologies and services

106
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:13,508
email for example all of a sudden in the

107
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:15,609
90s we see Internet and the

108
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:19,780
participation of third parties in

109
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:22,570
business from the year 2000 the social

110
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,849
media and smartphones all those

111
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:31,900
technologies are used by cyber criminals

112
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:40,960
to disseminate crimes from 2010 aware of

113
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:42,669
the cloud and in 2020 is not yet 2020

114
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,580
but we are still we are

115
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:48,490
speaking about the Internet of Things or

116
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:54,630
Internet of Things some may call it at

117
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:59,530
present usability dominates against the

118
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:03,820
security we see all those LED bulbs that

119
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:06,010
with Wi-Fi and a mobile application we

120
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,159
can change the intensity of the light

121
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:12,780
but we cannot evaluate whether this is a

122
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:17,190
secure feature for our office or not if

123
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:20,409
manufacturers have to implement security

124
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:23,680
including devices in the rooted in

125
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:27,700
passwords and settings then the users

126
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:34,210
will not buy it and this is the problem

127
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:35,620
we are facing right now hackers attacks

128
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,600
against companies what are cyber

129
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:44,590
criminals looking for they've been doing

130
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:49,330
it for many years so motivation is the

131
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:51,820
money and I don't know or I cannot say

132
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:58,780
it in millions of dollars or Euros

133
00:08:51,820 --> 00:09:01,810
but is it around 0.8 percent of the

134
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,000
world GDP that's more than drug

135
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,150
trafficking and human trafficking

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,180
together you can imagine then the huge

137
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:13,329
amount of money involved and is not only

138
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:17,319
the economic profit but in order to get

139
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:20,410
did they do not have to do much in order

140
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,690
to produce one kilogram of drugs many

141
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,370
things have this around the process all

142
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,340
to move hundreds of people from one

143
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:31,080
place into another but to commit a cyber

144
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,970
crime there's not much they have to do

145
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,550
other exceptions in this environment

146
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,280
this question comes because many

147
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,310
companies many SMEs or micro company

148
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:45,520
says that or think that criminals only

149
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:49,390
attack large companies this is not true

150
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:53,230
or not always true

151
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:56,680
large companies have more technological

152
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:59,800
maturity to defend themselves from cyber

153
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,380
crimes but small companies do not have

154
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,500
this level of maturity and they are the

155
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:11,920
right place or is more advisable for

156
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:15,310
them to attack the large companies and

157
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:19,599
that's the big questions as my company

158
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:23,859
really need cyber security and the

159
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,230
answer is very simple at present or a

160
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,740
few years ago we could say that in our

161
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:33,340
business processes cybersecurity wasn't

162
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:36,400
a need we had a computer just to create

163
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,110
and print office documents we use the

164
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,350
postal service's and that was the end of

165
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,230
the story now all our company's

166
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:47,560
processes whether large or small will

167
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:51,790
always require internet connection the

168
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:57,040
use of the cloud you are very young and

169
00:10:51,790 --> 00:11:00,160
probably do not use business services

170
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,689
but do you use any services without

171
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:10,089
internet for your personal or business

172
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:12,400
life you are connected to internet 24

173
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:17,410
hours a day we're all going to connect

174
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:21,430
to the net do we know about the risks to

175
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:28,180
our company do we know do you know about

176
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:29,920
any risk information the loss of

177
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,859
information information is our main

178
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:37,599
asset if we lose our information our

179
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:41,520
business will be closed but we have many

180
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,440
different risks I will explain them

181
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:50,040
during my presentation we have various

182
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,040
infections vulnerabilities phishing

183
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:57,479
reputational loss because we had a data

184
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:01,350
leak or somebody stole our information

185
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:07,040
there are many different risks and the

186
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:09,899
fact of not knowing them is to risking

187
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,360
and when I speak about this emmys or

188
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:19,560
micro companies we can have hardware

189
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:22,019
problems Beauty miss years for example

190
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,069
the cleaning stuff that comes to our

191
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:30,209
office they carry out their cleaning but

192
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:34,469
then they disconnected the server or any

193
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:36,300
switch so we don't have access to

194
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:40,470
information or the access to information

195
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,508
is interrupted and everything related to

196
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,889
our business that goes through this

197
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:50,970
device will no longer be available I can

198
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:54,569
give you an example when I was ICT

199
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:58,860
consultant in a business Indian I am

200
00:12:54,569 --> 00:13:04,560
from LAN by the way a cleaning lady went

201
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:06,720
into our office he was a legal firm she

202
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,790
went into an office where the server and

203
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,009
the rotor were located and she switched

204
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:16,380
everything off just to save the

205
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:20,189
electricity and the day after the

206
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:24,769
president asked what the hell did

207
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:24,769
happens we also have a risk

208
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:34,869
what insiders or former employees or

209
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:40,368
unhappy employees that want to damage

210
00:13:34,869 --> 00:13:43,100
our business and we should be very aware

211
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:45,399
of this fact that there are many

212
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:51,019
different projects that through

213
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:54,639
psychological profiling they ask about

214
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:58,730
the labor prevention there are internet

215
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:03,679
applications where you give certain

216
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:05,779
answers and your employees might have

217
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,949
enough information about you through a

218
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:12,199
psychological profile we can see whether

219
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:15,618
somebody person insider profile or

220
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:19,579
unhappy employee profile so the business

221
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:29,959
owners can get to know this potential

222
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:32,439
behavior of course problems more often

223
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:36,410
problems are related to vulnerability

224
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:41,868
what don't we see about 2017 what was

225
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:52,999
the main problem but what happened in

226
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:58,459
May June can you remember those horrible

227
00:14:52,999 --> 00:15:02,360
murder abilities if we make a summary of

228
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:06,049
wanna cry Microsoft released the patch

229
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,649
in March when a cry exploded in May two

230
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:13,189
months later how do I keep on going

231
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:16,100
without updating my systems for two

232
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:18,230
months about telefónica we should be

233
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,289
thankful the way they communicated

234
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:25,220
companies to do it as they did but this

235
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:27,410
was useful so that entrepreneurs were

236
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,139
more aware of became more aware of those

237
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:32,980
problems and also so that updating

238
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:37,129
policies might be designed differently

239
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:42,470
we also have a problem of vision we can

240
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:48,889
do how this is really easy virus malware

241
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:52,160
and identity replacement and ID stealing

242
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:55,990
that is so much related to facing we

243
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,269
have one of the most serious that are

244
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:03,019
industrial spine where we have a company

245
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:07,550
that can be our competitor wake up

246
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:12,500
designer a key product in the market and

247
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:19,040
our competitors can hire to the fact

248
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:21,829
that we have tailor-made cyber crime so

249
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,110
that they steal our information our

250
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:27,439
patent those attacks are quite

251
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:30,889
sophisticated they take few months the

252
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:38,329
cyber criminals but on many occasions

253
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:44,600
they are successful video with very

254
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:49,689
intense summary of what I said so that

255
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,689
you can see how a cyber criminal works

256
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,440
give us out

257
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,889
[Music]

258
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:29,490
another cuando tenía que esperan I

259
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:32,940
remember when I had to wait for my day's

260
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:35,790
work so the office was empty and I could

261
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:39,590
get in and steal computer equipment

262
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:43,200
money or companies informations since

263
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:45,840
international learning for my crimes is

264
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,210
dealing of a corporate information is

265
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,939
very easy so I asked for a rescue and

266
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,260
many companies do not even realize Who I

267
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,660
am

268
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:57,420
would you like to know our buttons in

269
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,940
Internet you will be surprised by all

270
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,580
the information available and how easy

271
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,920
it is to infect computers in those

272
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:09,570
companies that are not protected

273
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:13,080
sometimes I just need email with a virus

274
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:15,240
once infected I can send trojans carry

275
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,810
out financial transfers or get

276
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,810
information to resell it and when we

277
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:24,750
think how easy an anti-virus is I don't

278
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:29,330
have to make much effort I just have to

279
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:32,580
find somebody that my link this attached

280
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:36,629
execute a crack sort of the systems

281
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:38,730
department in a systems department that

282
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,870
does not have

283
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:46,230
an anti-virus system so my work is

284
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:48,419
easier when there is little awareness

285
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,190
about cybersecurity on many occasions

286
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,680
they install applications at the web

287
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:55,380
server and they expose them in Internet

288
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,680
without realizing they need of updating

289
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,530
them the need of patches the need of the

290
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:05,160
password or the directory with the

291
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:07,920
settings information with keys for

292
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,930
databases thanks to this sloppiness I

293
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,830
can get into their kitchen without them

294
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:18,530
realizing I like people asking me to spy

295
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:21,800
on their partners telephone lines or

296
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:27,240
information so I copy the information I

297
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:30,620
reveal the passwords in the caches when

298
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,260
is so it will be so easy for them just a

299
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:37,949
code access code when I go there I

300
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:40,320
install a hug Wi-Fi I start getting

301
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,510
information about employees and the

302
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,040
company and I can capture all the

303
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:46,350
information whether personal or

304
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,080
professional they don't know how

305
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:51,510
dangerous it is to connect to unknown

306
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,070
Wi-Fi network sometimes they might one

307
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,450
day they will realize and it will not

308
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,870
longer be able to do it

309
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:59,670
something else is when they ask me to

310
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,729
steal company's confidential information

311
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:08,100
to telephone an employee pretending I am

312
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:11,220
an IT technician and they give me the ID

313
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,889
and password and I'm in control of the

314
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,550
equipment while they have a coffee don't

315
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,380
they know that this information is

316
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:22,280
personal what about those that believe

317
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:25,950
that their name and date of birth is

318
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:29,789
difficult one thing some other people

319
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:35,149
think that just five consecutive letters

320
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:37,799
is and this is a good network they need

321
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:41,309
to note that they should use passwords

322
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,129
with symbols numbers capital letters etc

323
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:47,999
Internet is a grand place for us as

324
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:50,908
cyber criminals with companies that do

325
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:53,340
not care about their security or they do

326
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:55,590
not even think about the pliant measures

327
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,749
they can continue to do so we are

328
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,749
becoming really wealthy thanks to them

329
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,150
oh yeah

330
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:25,960
bobby's we stopped as you have seen in s

331
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:28,270
natural how how many things are possible

332
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,470
for cyber cyber criminals how do they do

333
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:36,790
it they used to attack pillars one

334
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:39,610
devoted to people this is the easiest we

335
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:43,450
are very vulnerable remember that the

336
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:46,179
weakest link is between the chair and

337
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,970
the screen or is just in front of the

338
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:52,560
screen about people they use social

339
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:58,390
engineering techniques so that cyber

340
00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:01,179
criminal make us do an action and we

341
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:04,240
even feel good about it

342
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,610
the urgency of the actions that we as

343
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,760
users do not have time to think let us

344
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:12,820
think of a manager that is requesting

345
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:19,930
something how are we gonna say no to a

346
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:21,129
manager fishing which is just email

347
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,310
impersonation

348
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:26,980
so that is but in a personalized way so

349
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:30,149
that is more convincing and some other

350
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:32,830
techniques making us visit a website

351
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:35,770
implementation of malicious applications

352
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,980
and then the area of our systems or

353
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:43,410
architectures where we have information

354
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:48,330
related to stolen cards malware

355
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:52,440
vulnerabilities related to websites

356
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:55,600
errors of management is implemented

357
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,390
applications so what happens with all

358
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:03,689
those problems when we speak about the

359
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:07,360
business services in vision or

360
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:10,270
impersonation about the website contents

361
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,649
I'm going to show you some examples that

362
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:17,020
are a great impact and that happen every

363
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:22,150
day and now I will reproduce

364
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:25,600
a fishing to capture ID information so

365
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:29,770
this is those will be real stories that

366
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:34,169
in our national cyber crime aims the

367
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:38,830
incident get every day and this is Maria

368
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:43,960
in places spy fishing social engineering

369
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:47,639
and a defacement now Maria Hassan

370
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:58,360
employee Alexandra C receives an email

371
00:23:47,640 --> 00:24:00,370
from ski monitor with a PDF file there

372
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,820
was a previous study of the information

373
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:07,239
Alexandra probably published in Facebook

374
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:09,879
but her son went on skin lessons and

375
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:15,430
hacker investigated on her life and

376
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:20,230
since her this file Alexandra will open

377
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:23,020
it up see the hacker will know

378
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:26,200
information so that Alexandra does not

379
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:28,389
have to make any action or confirm about

380
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:33,910
any change in the information in the

381
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:36,580
file then one of Rome IT department says

382
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,290
that the customers are saying that the

383
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:41,350
web site is changed

384
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,860
Maria is really concerned about this and

385
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:47,350
when she goes on access her website a

386
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,929
page with my world does not correspond

387
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:52,659
to the original website Google and the

388
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:55,570
browsers show us a warning message that

389
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,850
sometimes letters access the web or not

390
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,799
in this case

391
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:04,870
we could get to the websites but the

392
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:08,789
cybercriminal had uploaded uploaded

393
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:12,580
another application that sold falsify

394
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:15,090
product from the legitimate website this

395
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:20,080
is quite serious but there are even more

396
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:21,730
those that we have seen since the end of

397
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,649
last year and beginning of this year

398
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:29,830
what we call the CEO fraud or the whale

399
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:32,919
illness we have the fishing that affect

400
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:37,480
many people and the whaling that is the

401
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:42,429
big waves people that really are the

402
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:44,380
boss now what they do is the same as in

403
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:48,280
the previous example with Marian

404
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:54,520
Alexandra but they can access or contact

405
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:56,770
the people that have decision makers not

406
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,460
in the middle management but in the

407
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:04,720
higher ranks why they could manipulate

408
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:09,039
bank accounts they could do high amount

409
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:12,419
transfers please send me a balance of

410
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:16,150
our account or let us do a confidential

411
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:19,480
operation and please hold the

412
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,720
information and the lease is public so

413
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,169
they use social engineering in order to

414
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,990
convince the users and is easy to get

415
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:32,500
into it don't you think that managers

416
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:35,980
are not vulnerable there's something

417
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:38,830
that was said in the video which is to

418
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,419
be aware of this situation on many

419
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,379
occasions we don't have time to be

420
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:47,440
trained to learn about security and when

421
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:53,220
we are not aware of this problem it will

422
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:58,780
be easy for us to get into their hands

423
00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:00,540
if we can define the year 2017 in cyber

424
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,940
security or in service

425
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:06,000
the attacks this year we can speak about

426
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:08,280
run somewhere on the last year's we

427
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,600
could also speak about the semies

428
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:17,030
ransomware this is what has been more

429
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:24,540
damaging to micro companies and SMEs why

430
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:27,450
once again my we're ciphers information

431
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:32,040
from your device and makes it no longer

432
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:38,030
accessible in our Institute we always

433
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:44,060
recommend not to accept these bribery

434
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:46,860
why because it will be never ending his

435
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:50,370
business line where cyber criminals have

436
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,639
a niche and if we pay from this

437
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:57,719
blackmail we will never be the end of

438
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,660
the study but what is better to lose

439
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:05,250
information or to pay 300 or 500 years

440
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:10,290
what would you do in this dilemma just

441
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:13,320
be honest you will pay but here we are

442
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,899
just a feeding on the problem over and

443
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:19,800
over and there are many companies that

444
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:24,360
pay due to this situation so what we

445
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:27,750
have to do is to prevent or mitigate the

446
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:32,179
possibilities are the likelihood to be

447
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:36,420
infected by those bugs now before

448
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:41,400
speaking about potential measure to

449
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:46,590
protect our jobs we're gonna see how

450
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:50,090
cyber criminals can get email address in

451
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:53,129
order to implement this in an how to

452
00:28:50,090 --> 00:29:02,100
create a fishing system this is

453
00:28:53,130 --> 00:29:05,610
something quite easy and in fact it

454
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:08,260
generates a great deal of profit I will

455
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:12,428
do it in a very simple manner we can

456
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:14,620
use false certificates and more

457
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:18,120
sophisticated means but I'm gonna use a

458
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,120
very simple one

459
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,040
no polymer reproducible at rallies they

460
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,750
this a monitor

461
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:42,420
bear with is the second word tried we're

462
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:45,530
going to try to play it on screen see

463
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,530
love it looks we must laugh

464
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,960
don't dismiss see what we get

465
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:27,899
that's all you perfect pallet let me try

466
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,910
to explain to you how they extract email

467
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,530
accounts this is one of the more

468
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:38,460
commonly used tools in order to spread

469
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:41,490
more work to do fishing another militia

470
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:45,840
some actions carried out by cyber

471
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:47,910
criminals all these applications that

472
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,389
I'm going to use and share with you are

473
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:55,470
available on the Internet really

474
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:58,010
available very public and youngsters

475
00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:00,960
probably are very much familiar with

476
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:04,710
good what I'm going to do at this point

477
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,340
is try to compile email address it

478
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:12,150
address it so that I can send my

479
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:20,459
phishing attacks so I'm going to use my

480
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:23,660
company I don't want to attacked or sold

481
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,340
other companies if you give me your

482
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,770
authorization I can of course try to

483
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:33,080
attack yours but I'm going to use cyber

484
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:36,870
candidates and these tools they use is

485
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:47,370
indexed information is the information

486
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:49,979
indexed by Google okay I'm just a fun

487
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:52,530
for you to see so the search engines

488
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,620
have evolved full time and these are

489
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,750
tools that cyber criminals are using in

490
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,489
order to collect information in the past

491
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,160
we were talking about only public

492
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,360
information but now we're talking about

493
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:07,050
extracting information within documents

494
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,419
and now they can extract or collect data

495
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:13,879
from the made of data after your

496
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:20,640
documents and these are made of data

497
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:23,780
we're not experts let's say difficult to

498
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:29,400
erase this information now for example

499
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:32,430
our users state logging information the

500
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,370
software that we're using to edit the

501
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:38,340
document that can also be exposed to

502
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,709
vulnerabilities etc because in this

503
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:44,129
specific case if you take a look we have

504
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:48,000
a series of email addresses all of which

505
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:51,240
are public and if you test other domains

506
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:57,450
you'll see that it's very easy to do

507
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:59,520
it's very easy to find an email I'm

508
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:03,420
going to send this phishing to my

509
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:08,180
co-workers colleagues and I could use a

510
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:11,640
social engineering tool in order to

511
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,620
compile for conduct passwords for

512
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:18,120
example from an asset from a specific

513
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:23,610
side here I have my personal site it's

514
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:28,979
how you are l miss cocina Scott es /

515
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:31,860
Thea now this is a back-end series of

516
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,390
credentials you can administer your was

517
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:40,939
the website yeah so I'm going to send to

518
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:44,430
an employee that is managing the

519
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:47,400
information the URL of a malicious site

520
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:51,450
that I control in order to steal the

521
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:54,870
credentials from that that's what I'm

522
00:33:51,450 --> 00:34:00,870
going to try to do so I use an

523
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:02,969
application I'm very quickly going to

524
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:09,299
parameterize the application that I want

525
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:11,850
to use I'm going to clone the site this

526
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:15,060
is going to be the malicious equipment

527
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:20,690
that I'm going to use in this specific

528
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:20,690
case I need to know what the IP address

529
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:32,860
by the way that la la I'm going to

530
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,339
introduce the URL that I'm going to

531
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,340
clone

532
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,400
not gonna lovey-dovey clone it very

533
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:55,650
quickly as you can see and this side is

534
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:59,640
now perfectly designed to perpetrate I

535
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:02,280
send someone the URL directly in order

536
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:06,859
to access that side while he can suspect

537
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:09,590
so what I'm going to do instead

538
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:12,870
surrender my attack a bit more credible

539
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:16,140
so what I'm going to do is open a word

540
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:26,250
file a word document and I'm going to

541
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:29,609
select this on the link that addresses

542
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:35,400
me or redirect me to the malicious

543
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:42,300
server I can save this file in a PDF

544
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:45,780
format and once I have saved it I can

545
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:49,460
send this file to this person justice

546
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:54,740
Maria that sent Alejandra the employee

547
00:35:49,460 --> 00:36:01,440
uninfected file now we're going to send

548
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:04,229
this document search engine and if you

549
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,170
take a look in this tag we have the

550
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:11,360
legitimate web site and in this other

551
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:14,460
tag we have the malicious server page

552
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:17,400
it's very hard to identify the

553
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,450
differences they're almost identical and

554
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,360
in this case for you to see more clearly

555
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:26,850
this I'm as you can see I'm accessing a

556
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:31,920
virtual machine which is the malicious

557
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:39,410
server from the victims computer and

558
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:47,670
under once the system is

559
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:49,680
ready I access the documents URL and I'm

560
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,800
unaware of that number and I introduce

561
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,879
the passwords user and password admin

562
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,880
admin access

563
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,310
that was something absolutely something

564
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:17,240
happened

565
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,240
this always happens

566
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,940
yes

567
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:59,640
I'm sorry for this please bear with me a

568
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,640
minute making a fool myself

569
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,989
we have a motion that is a store that

570
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:41,939
you're very much interested in this

571
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:41,940
right you even move faces 39 to 28

572
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:56,050
I'm going to use another one maybe I

573
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:59,919
have that good shape I'm going to use

574
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:01,270
Facebook for example maybe those chaps

575
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,680
in the back of the room are more

576
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,680
interested in Facebook

577
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,750
[Music]

578
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:49,619
I believe okay so this is my site by the

579
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,109
way you shouldn't do this with pages

580
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:56,700
that learn under your control in this

581
00:39:52,109 --> 00:40:00,299
case I access the Facebook site and you

582
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:02,509
can see legible information but I'm

583
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:08,190
going to introduce the alleged

584
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:13,280
credentials of a given user and my

585
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:18,030
password as you can see this isn't

586
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:22,740
Facebook need to be aware of the fact

587
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:26,640
that a certificate isn't being used for

588
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:31,520
communications and when we access as you

589
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:36,450
will see we are redirected to Facebook

590
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:40,740
in this case as you can see here the

591
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:44,848
attack has been successful this says

592
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:47,790
that if the victim has clicked in order

593
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:51,300
to access that site it has introduced

594
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:54,930
the credentials in the server war that

595
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,760
employs stored and ism in this case the

596
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,490
malicious server I would be able to

597
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:04,619
compile that datum if this attacked

598
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:10,290
let's say it's transferred to thousands

599
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:14,819
of hundreds or thousands of who email

600
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:17,970
addresses let's think about potential

601
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:23,579
users of Facebook well in that case we

602
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:28,649
will be able to use a many many email

603
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:32,940
accounts in a malicious manner and as

604
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:36,650
they say on TV no don't do this at home

605
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:40,339
please and do it under your own

606
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:46,910
responsibility I'm just doing this for

607
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:50,180
educational purposes goodness

608
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:56,370
resume the presentation at this point

609
00:41:50,180 --> 00:42:00,779
good companies and businesses understand

610
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:04,400
that ICT services can be outsourced and

611
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:06,960
this is quite common and nobody is

612
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,840
surprised by the fact that company is

613
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,920
outsource their ICT services because

614
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:18,960
they don't have and how staff to do this

615
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:20,850
and if we contact our ICT service and

616
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,590
ask them if they're aware of the need of

617
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:26,910
cybersecurity well of course they'll

618
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:31,620
answer yes they need to be familiar with

619
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:34,740
all the latest technologies but when we

620
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,690
sign an agreement with an ICT provider

621
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:40,979
we always need to have a contract

622
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:44,630
agreement that has clear terms and

623
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:48,930
conditions as to everything related to

624
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:52,650
ICT support that we want and also

625
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:54,569
everything pertaining to privacy

626
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:58,800
agreements how they're going to treat

627
00:42:54,570 --> 00:43:02,310
and process and information and this is

628
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,550
very important and yesterday I visited

629
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:07,049
the Chamber of Commerce and I made a

630
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:10,290
presentation pretty much in line with

631
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,300
what I'm saying here today and I was

632
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:14,880
asking them about who was doing the

633
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:17,340
backup copies and they said the IT

634
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,890
service and I said how often do they do

635
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:22,440
the backups and they said well I really

636
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:24,359
don't know that's what this gent said

637
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,730
and that's really a problem because the

638
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,760
VR the interested party if we were the

639
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:31,410
costumer and we don't know when the

640
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,480
backups are going to be done well that

641
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,850
in itself is a problem we need to be

642
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:42,800
aware of that information we need to be

643
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:46,049
on top of it what happens when we end

644
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,440
for example a collaboration with the

645
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:51,690
provider this is what we call captive

646
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:55,150
customers because they have our data our

647
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:58,400
information they view manage

648
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:00,259
confidential information we don't know

649
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,029
whether they're going to try to attack

650
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:06,469
us or damages with this information so

651
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:09,109
it's very important that in our

652
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:10,939
agreements with them we have clear terms

653
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:13,729
and conditions as to how they're going

654
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:15,739
to save all info pertaining to your

655
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:19,359
company and how they're going to erase

656
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:22,939
it from their hardware once our

657
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:26,839
collaboration comes to an end probably

658
00:44:22,939 --> 00:44:30,078
when you need on IT service to have

659
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:34,369
different actress implemented you will

660
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:37,189
need for all the remote access and you

661
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:40,549
need to automate all these processes in

662
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:43,848
the past I automated accesses in order

663
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:46,249
not to have to ask for access constantly

664
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:49,699
but you need to make sure that you

665
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:54,890
disable this feature if you change

666
00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:58,489
provider and now we're going to move on

667
00:44:54,890 --> 00:45:01,038
and I'm going to talk to you with

668
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:03,229
further detail about non-disclosure

669
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:07,269
agreements so that you understand all

670
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:11,808
the elements that need to be included in

671
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:15,069
disclosure agreements and need to be

672
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:15,069
delete taken on board

673
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,919
[Music]

674
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:45,250
since we set up our business we of

675
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:49,870
course signed many contracts with

676
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:53,230
providers and customers some were verbal

677
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:58,420
in nature or inaccurate in this area so

678
00:45:53,230 --> 00:46:02,290
tell this led to loopholes so the Code

679
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,200
of Ethics is based on ethical values and

680
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:07,360
corporate responsibility and to ensure a

681
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,790
good name in our relationship with

682
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,520
customers and providers we started to

683
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:16,410
formalize all our agreements for example

684
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:20,470
we assigned agreements with legal

685
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:25,089
consultancy and with the consultancy

686
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:28,600
firm and all these providers have access

687
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:31,090
to highly sensitive information from our

688
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,330
business that's why we had to sign yes

689
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:35,560
sir yes non-disclosure agreements and

690
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:38,770
confidentiality agreements we also still

691
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,830
reached similar agreements with our

692
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:44,560
customers and we signed agreements for

693
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:46,900
non-disclosure purposes and of course we

694
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,410
need to protect information and respect

695
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:52,510
non-disclosure terms as employees we

696
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:54,640
have confidentiality or non-disclosure

697
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:57,130
agreements as well with our employees

698
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,319
let us give you some recommendations

699
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,720
regarding what you need to include an

700
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,770
non-disclosure agreements based on our

701
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:08,200
own experience the structure and

702
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:11,140
contents of non-disclosure agreements

703
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,569
may vary depending on each situation but

704
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:16,890
broadly speaking we need to cover the

705
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:20,590
following sections place and date

706
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:23,379
parties that take part the reason behind

707
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:25,240
this Agreement the service provided and

708
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,150
of course the confidentiality or

709
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,430
non-disclosure you cross or term then we

710
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,440
need to describe the activities

711
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,118
performed by each of the parties and the

712
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,210
reason we

713
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,880
the agreement or contract and we need to

714
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:42,349
specify the service that will be covered

715
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,940
by this agreement unless we will address

716
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:46,859
confidentiality or non-disclosure issues

717
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:50,970
and this agreement needs to include a

718
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:53,098
description regarding what we understand

719
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:55,910
by confidential information for example

720
00:47:53,099 --> 00:48:00,029
procedures techniques designs of

721
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:02,038
blueprints diagrams models sewage the

722
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:05,160
supplier can access in order to provide

723
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:07,499
his service but this classification of

724
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:11,269
information will depend on the nature of

725
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:14,430
each business it's also necessary to

726
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:18,359
specify what we understand by

727
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:21,950
confidentiality for example acceptable

728
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:25,440
use of information duration of secrecy

729
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:28,169
Duty the security measures that need to

730
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,660
be implemented etc let me go back to the

731
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:34,349
previous example in the non-disclosure

732
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:37,319
agreement with her legal advisory firm

733
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:40,499
we for example established that

734
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:45,180
information can only be used for the

735
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:50,058
purposes of legal advisory and not for

736
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:52,890
commercial purposes these contract

737
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:55,190
requires them to ensure the

738
00:48:52,890 --> 00:49:00,269
confidentiality and privacy of our

739
00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:02,670
information and our company we

740
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:06,868
established that there's an obligation

741
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:11,430
of secrecy and/or professional secrecy

742
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:15,210
to me to be more exactly loped the

743
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:18,058
legislation enforces Spain specifies

744
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:20,460
this need for professional secrecy and

745
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:23,369
once this collaboration comes to an end

746
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,529
the and personal data from our business

747
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:27,630
needs to be destroyed in a safe and

748
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:30,569
secure manner and of course we need to

749
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:32,999
consider issues that go beyond technical

750
00:49:30,569 --> 00:49:36,058
measures the non-disclosure agreements

751
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:38,339
allow us to regulate and govern service

752
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:41,160
provision improving the security of our

753
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:44,220
data whenever this data sexist by third

754
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,170
parties we need to regulate and govern

755
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:48,419
the service provision today in order to

756
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:51,410
prevent future problems don't leave this

757
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,410
on the wayside

758
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:15,000
see see see it's very important to sign

759
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:19,020
non-disclosure agreements because of

760
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:23,400
course if our information has been

761
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:26,880
compromised we would like to hold people

762
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:30,420
accountable this is like a contract we

763
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,290
cannot expect people to be held

764
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:36,420
accountable unless there is

765
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:39,900
non-disclosure agreement at this point I

766
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:44,070
want to talk to you about security of

767
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:46,770
steering plans what is this about well

768
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:49,620
this is the application or

769
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:52,710
implementation of the series policies

770
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:55,140
measures and best practices but we need

771
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,480
to adopt and our businesses there are

772
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:04,200
many methodologies many different

773
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:09,450
standards I as 27000 that regulate how

774
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:13,770
these date management systems need to be

775
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:17,419
designed but sometimes if our businesses

776
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:19,950
are small we don't need to apply these

777
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:22,470
standards that's why we have the

778
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:26,089
security plans which are the starting

779
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:29,669
point for the management of security and

780
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:32,040
SMEs and micro companies of what are the

781
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,990
steps that we need to take into

782
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,660
consideration well first we need to

783
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:38,790
conduct a preliminary analysis in order

784
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,140
to identify the risk level of the

785
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:42,570
company we need to know where we stand

786
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:45,150
that's not the case you won't be able to

787
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:47,190
be able to read articles in terms of

788
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:50,430
security and we need to define strategic

789
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:52,740
goals the company strategic objectives

790
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:55,859
theme strategy needs to be very much

791
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:57,569
aligned with the business to make sure

792
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,790
that we do things well we need to

793
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:00,160
identify the departments and processes

794
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:02,490
that are

795
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,700
going to be affected by the security

796
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:08,799
steering plan or master plan and of

797
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:12,399
course we will have to disseminate best

798
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:16,030
practices among employees in order to

799
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:17,819
implement our plan our master plans how

800
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:22,150
should i implement this well there's no

801
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:24,220
specific guideline it can be talk to men

802
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:26,049
with a set of recommendations for

803
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,730
example in the case of passwords make

804
00:52:26,049 --> 00:52:29,559
sure you might apply your password every

805
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:31,089
90 days you make sure you follow this

806
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:34,089
structure make sure you have at least

807
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:35,980
nine characters we can have four or five

808
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:38,170
tips recommendations based on the

809
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,760
specific needs of the prisoners

810
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:42,099
dependents are depending on their

811
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,039
technology differences and the movie

812
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:47,770
analogical maturity of the company and

813
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:51,760
we can have an ongoing improvement cycle

814
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:53,259
with this six some phases you know what

815
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,420
the current situation is the

816
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,910
organization strategy two different

817
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:00,670
approaches classify and prioritize and

818
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:02,410
of course the management needs to

819
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,059
approve all this because without the

820
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:05,710
support of the management this won't be

821
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:08,410
able to be implemented and then

822
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:10,089
implement executed out on the field now

823
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:13,629
this master plan needs to be realistic

824
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:16,839
in order to be implemented sometimes we

825
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:19,869
aren't realistic we are overly ambitious

826
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:22,240
and this means that implementation is

827
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:25,230
very difficult and the monitoring and

828
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:29,200
auditing of this process is very very

829
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:32,770
difficult we don't want to crack nuts

830
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,689
using a sledgehammer here know when you

831
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:37,089
have a clear plan this is going to be

832
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:40,390
very important for the organization to

833
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:42,038
protect and ensure cybersecurity and

834
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:45,609
it's very important that this plan is

835
00:53:42,039 --> 00:53:48,099
reviewed and we visited in a systematic

836
00:53:45,609 --> 00:53:49,630
manner on a periodic basis there needs

837
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,789
to be an ongoing improvement plan in

838
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,930
order to review it why is it necessary

839
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:56,470
to review this fund

840
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:59,589
well because I'm changes can occur and

841
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:03,169
that can call for this review

842
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:06,259
for example our IT consultancy service

843
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:09,020
was out first but then one day we decide

844
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:12,230
to hire somebody to do this task

845
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:13,910
in-house so that means that the whole

846
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,349
situation changes something that needs

847
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,710
to be taken on board and we need to

848
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:20,089
review our plan at these Spanish

849
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,980
cybersecurity Institute they tell us yes

850
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:24,500
what you're saying is wonderful if your

851
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:26,869
reticle but I want hands on measures I

852
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:31,220
want to know what the security level of

853
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:35,740
my company is and the result of this

854
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:39,020
need we've developed in design

855
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:41,899
self-diagnosis service and in only five

856
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:44,180
minutes time you can assess the state of

857
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:49,839
play of your company in terms of

858
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:54,190
cybersecurity regarding people equipment

859
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:59,078
supports and now I'm going to simulate

860
00:54:54,190 --> 00:55:10,520
this I'm going to simulate this tool I

861
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:14,049
will pretend that now I am an dependent

862
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:17,119
and the tool is just a questioner and

863
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:20,240
depending on the way we reply we will

864
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:23,089
get the level of risk of the

865
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:28,069
organization I'm gonna use for the

866
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:31,270
simulation email website and a server

867
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:37,700
three technologies that almost all

868
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:39,920
Assamese use once we select the

869
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,779
technologies there will be more

870
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,440
questions but I'm just going to simulate

871
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:48,579
that I am an SMS how do you update your

872
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,579
IT systems

873
00:55:56,590 --> 00:56:02,800
what was it we have a problem with the

874
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:12,600
presentation I will be back

875
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:12,600
went see no not

876
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,669
I'm sorry

877
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:40,820
balli all right as I was in we select

878
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:44,120
the technologies email website our own

879
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:45,830
server and then we reply to the

880
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:50,240
questions how do you update your ID

881
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:53,840
systems you we do it ourselves just with

882
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:59,319
a friend we outsource them or we have an

883
00:56:53,840 --> 00:57:06,470
IT expert SM is usually outsource this

884
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:09,010
service then do you have any protection

885
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:11,750
system in your computers do you use it

886
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:15,280
usually companies always say they have

887
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:19,490
antivirus since though in other devices

888
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:24,620
so we will respond or equipment's of an

889
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:26,359
antivirus have you recently trained your

890
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,520
employees in cyber security

891
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:32,300
the majority of SMEs in our experience

892
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:36,200
do not provide training but when we ask

893
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:39,830
those questions they almost always say

894
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:44,060
that they've given the employees

895
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:47,090
information to read do you have access

896
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:50,049
control to your venue not access is free

897
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:51,860
we use cards or physical security

898
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:56,350
systems we have a cover

899
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:59,600
God usually is just keys and they have

900
00:57:56,350 --> 00:58:02,029
security systems they have a system to

901
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:06,500
manage the passwords usually the answer

902
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:11,660
is no but users choose a password with

903
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:15,050
some given criteria how do you get rid

904
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:17,870
of the systems that you no longer use is

905
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:22,580
usually to keep it hardcopy and the rest

906
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:24,799
they just go to to the bin we as a with

907
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:26,090
what do you do with your hard disk when

908
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:28,850
you sell them they

909
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:30,500
really no do you are you present in the

910
00:58:28,850 --> 00:58:34,430
social media that you should have an

911
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:37,430
account but because there are have a

912
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:43,700
community manager they usually manage

913
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:47,089
their accounts themselves company B

914
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:49,370
without an email until it becomes a

915
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:53,330
problem they all answer less than four

916
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:56,870
hours when you ask them about the

917
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:59,950
contingency plan then they don't really

918
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:03,319
have an answer they say well they might

919
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:09,470
prolong this time how often do you

920
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:14,830
update your email server companies do

921
00:59:09,470 --> 00:59:19,279
not know o type of email service you use

922
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:25,130
sometimes they keep their emails more

923
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:30,200
email system ID systems who eliminate

924
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:33,110
the email accounts usually the outsource

925
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:36,620
company how long can your company be

926
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:39,410
with an interrupted website the same as

927
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:42,650
with email less than four hours how then

928
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:45,890
do you make backups of your website

929
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:49,940
contents either never or they do not

930
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:54,020
know if you see to the right there's a

931
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:56,200
bar that one we answer the questions we

932
00:59:54,020 --> 01:00:01,400
have information about the level of risk

933
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:04,189
who can access the website content some

934
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:08,270
authorized users how often do you update

935
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:11,420
the dual that updates your website they

936
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:14,030
usually do not know it they ask the IT

937
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:16,190
systems department

938
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:19,030
when you ask them about security

939
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:25,070
features they say yes but no question

940
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:29,680
how often how long can your company

941
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:33,470
survive with the systems down they say

942
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:35,960
if the accident happens at 12:00 at

943
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:39,830
night by 5:00 they should be up and

944
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:42,680
running how often they do not know

945
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:45,230
whether they make remote connections to

946
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:49,330
their systems and employees can access

947
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:52,760
internal applications from a remote

948
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:55,580
screen is using who can administer

949
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:59,630
internal applications some authorized

950
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:04,210
users where are the servers and duties

951
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:08,840
of the organization located usually in

952
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:11,180
an office space with limited access do

953
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,910
you have a contingency plan in case

954
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:18,560
there is an accident so that your

955
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:24,890
business can no longer be running backs

956
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:27,770
up are usually the most common system

957
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:30,910
but they know about them that they

958
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:38,150
haven't checked whether they are always

959
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:41,390
in place they usually say yes the last

960
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:46,940
question do you have contacts with your

961
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:49,609
IT suppliers they think they do in 95%

962
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:52,490
of the answers and depending on the

963
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:56,600
answers the company's level of risk in

964
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:58,759
this case is 78.4% therefore very high

965
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:03,950
what we do

966
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:06,950
to mitigate this problem when we see the

967
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:10,520
score of these self-diagnosis we offer

968
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:13,189
basic mitigation measures that companies

969
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:15,650
can implement them in their environments

970
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:18,980
mitigation measures related to people

971
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:21,830
processes and technologies once they are

972
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:25,310
aware of the level of risk they are able

973
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:31,509
to implement security measures and

974
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:31,509
security guiding plan or any other need

975
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:07,220
disculpa la Fiera a lamprey a la

976
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:09,850
pantalla ah no me no vesicle a

977
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,850
presentation

978
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,500
to

979
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:45,790
the typical topic Oh Casa del delito

980
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:48,259
mother no more Ont pero si si well a

981
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:52,040
difficulties of broadcasting life well

982
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:53,780
we are back we know how to measure the

983
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:55,790
level of risk of our organization this

984
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:58,600
was the starting point now we're going

985
01:03:55,790 --> 01:04:03,670
to talk what are the protection measures

986
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:08,210
for our job at present when we go to

987
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:14,780
certain place and we ask is difficult to

988
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:20,300
is very where to see the posses monitors

989
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:25,100
but if we open up a drawer or keyboard

990
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:29,230
we see that we still use this way of

991
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:35,089
protecting our password so it's very

992
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:38,660
important to start from the job station

993
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:41,210
this is the place where we carry out our

994
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:44,359
activities and we should protect them we

995
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:51,290
shouldn't show our passwords they should

996
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:54,410
be visible not accessible we need to use

997
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:57,320
a password manager as kiba's is a free

998
01:04:54,410 --> 01:05:03,560
system that will cipher our password so

999
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:08,510
nobody will be able to know them do not

1000
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:14,830
let mobile devices whether a smartphones

1001
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:20,210
or USB is accessible many of you know

1002
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:23,470
about situations on how do we get

1003
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:29,020
information from a smart phone

1004
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:29,020
even though protected by a pin code

1005
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:37,029
sensitive or confidential information

1006
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:41,029
should never be visible and the dustbin

1007
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:42,740
should never have sensitive documents

1008
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:44,030
confidential information should be

1009
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:46,729
destroyed

1010
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:49,040
what about password you all know that

1011
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:53,869
the password should have more than nine

1012
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:57,320
characters at least the capital letters

1013
01:05:53,869 --> 01:06:01,970
no keys and numbers but you know that

1014
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:05,540
the fact of having a robust password if

1015
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:09,020
we are victims of officials is not going

1016
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:11,990
to protect us the cyber criminal will

1017
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:14,570
get to know the password so what do we

1018
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:17,149
have to do as much as possible in

1019
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:20,900
addition to using those robusta

1020
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:25,090
passwords we need to use all the

1021
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:28,610
services that use dual authentication

1022
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:31,150
systems secure applications in our

1023
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:33,920
business environment we need to use

1024
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:37,280
secure applications what do I mean by

1025
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,619
this official applications not using

1026
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:42,740
pirate applications where there are

1027
01:06:39,619 --> 01:06:46,369
crackers or other problems that are

1028
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:51,709
usually negative many in many companies

1029
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:56,900
IT services or your friends not to blame

1030
01:06:51,710 --> 01:07:01,750
anybody they probably are willing to

1031
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:06,680
install a pirate office and here we are

1032
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:10,369
endangering our PC applications have to

1033
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:13,490
be updated we cannot use applications

1034
01:07:10,369 --> 01:07:17,869
without security patches unofficial

1035
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:23,109
applications cannot be updated that

1036
01:07:17,869 --> 01:07:27,340
could prevent any sort of computing

1037
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:30,529
problem portable information USBs

1038
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:33,780
hard disk and smartphones we have all

1039
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:37,470
lost USBs and we

1040
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:42,560
happens information loaded in the USB

1041
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:46,589
the testing that we work in a healthcare

1042
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:49,230
company with highly sensitive data

1043
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:53,220
confidential information protected by

1044
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:56,010
the law if we lose this data a year made

1045
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:59,370
public and the Spanish Agency of data

1046
01:07:56,010 --> 01:08:02,130
protection gets to know it we will be

1047
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:05,100
suctioned therefore when or fined so

1048
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:08,280
whenever we handle confidential

1049
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:11,700
information we should do it in a coded

1050
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:14,490
or cipher way with using Benna crypt

1051
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:17,479
there are free systems that allow us to

1052
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:23,010
cipher information in a simple way

1053
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:24,660
guaranteeing its security and it's

1054
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:27,510
rather easy

1055
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:30,889
I need my customers information to be

1056
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:35,990
protected first we have to identify

1057
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:39,120
information unclassified whether is

1058
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:41,760
confidential information is we kept

1059
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:44,490
ciphered in a safety box if it's

1060
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:47,790
internal information we need to apply

1061
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:49,679
the appropriate measures and if it's not

1062
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:52,680
confidential then we don't have to apply

1063
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:55,170
anything so first we should classify the

1064
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:58,230
information according to this

1065
01:08:55,170 --> 01:09:08,870
classification we will implement a

1066
01:08:58,229 --> 01:09:13,620
certain to keep it whether through users

1067
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:17,460
access if this ID or a physical system

1068
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:20,040
limiting the access by lock always

1069
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:23,160
knowing who can access in relation to

1070
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:26,100
IDs we should implement login or

1071
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:30,059
register measures to see when somebody

1072
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:33,420
has logged in or modified or change

1073
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:36,380
anything so we provide an extra feature

1074
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:39,770
to the security so from the next

1075
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:42,170
with a specific date that makes the

1076
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:45,139
updating compulsory and we should

1077
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:46,819
destroy the information accordingly if

1078
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:50,060
it's a hard copy with conventional

1079
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:54,650
systems but if we use and if we use

1080
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:57,199
physical copies there are companies we

1081
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:58,820
can always destroy this information

1082
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:01,790
manually but there are professional

1083
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:04,369
companies that destroy information there

1084
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:08,060
are also tools for normal uses as the

1085
01:10:04,369 --> 01:10:11,570
one or other applications that allow to

1086
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:15,349
do it in the office personal data

1087
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:17,929
protection this is something that all

1088
01:10:15,349 --> 01:10:20,000
companies are really scare about they

1089
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:23,290
don't know they are complying or not and

1090
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:28,599
the accidents are quite powerful and

1091
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:31,820
many we use customers employees and

1092
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:34,639
providers information we have to be

1093
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:37,340
dated and from margin next year it will

1094
01:10:34,639 --> 01:10:41,900
be compulsory the Data Protection Agency

1095
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:43,790
would safeguard know compliance and if

1096
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:45,799
we have any doubt and we need some

1097
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:50,239
clarification we just have to contact

1098
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:54,560
them they usually give prompts replace

1099
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:56,780
to our queries in our business we can

1100
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,510
never also we should never request data

1101
01:10:56,780 --> 01:11:02,059
that are not going to be used this is

1102
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:05,329
something that is subject to sanctions

1103
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:08,690
and if we have a website with

1104
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:14,170
information we should provide

1105
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:17,199
information about our rights access

1106
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:20,800
ratification cancellation or opposition

1107
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:26,150
we should apply the necessary measures

1108
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:28,969
who is the responsible of data files etc

1109
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:31,429
we should always see the personal data

1110
01:11:28,969 --> 01:11:34,880
protection the fact of complying with

1111
01:11:31,429 --> 01:11:38,719
the regulation will generate trust to

1112
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:41,630
our customers without the exception when

1113
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:43,010
this example is you go and access a

1114
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:47,170
website

1115
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:50,179
and if they have trust the stamp you can

1116
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:55,519
trust the page this is not always the

1117
01:11:50,179 --> 01:11:57,500
case um use the certification in a non

1118
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:59,360
legitimate manner but if you know for

1119
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:02,059
sure that the website is complying with

1120
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:04,659
the regulation this will offer a greater

1121
01:12:02,059 --> 01:12:07,010
level of trust

1122
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:13,329
teleworking this is something and there

1123
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:13,329
is more present in the work and family

1124
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:21,579
conciliation we need the same masters as

1125
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:25,519
in our office we need to work in a

1126
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:29,239
secure system with antivirus an updated

1127
01:12:25,519 --> 01:12:37,659
system we should only use the device for

1128
01:12:29,239 --> 01:12:42,230
work and whenever possible it should be

1129
01:12:37,659 --> 01:12:44,388
used only for work histological prices

1130
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:49,940
allow us to have now different devices

1131
01:12:44,389 --> 01:12:54,769
for different purposes and we sometimes

1132
01:12:49,940 --> 01:13:01,339
use mobile devices the smartphone or

1133
01:12:54,769 --> 01:13:04,610
their tablets to access our jobs if our

1134
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:08,869
company had many employees using this

1135
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:12,139
type of portable tools remotely we could

1136
01:13:08,869 --> 01:13:15,619
estimate the implementation of a mobile

1137
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:22,010
device management MDM there is quite

1138
01:13:15,619 --> 01:13:25,250
economical teleworking or working from

1139
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:30,170
home from our personal pieces those that

1140
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:33,500
we also use for Leisha the same we need

1141
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:37,099
the guarantee that working on a safe PC

1142
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:43,730
is not enough with an antivirus we need

1143
01:13:37,099 --> 01:13:47,449
to use it with limited rivet ID who uses

1144
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:48,989
your computer at home without an

1145
01:13:47,449 --> 01:13:51,598
administration

1146
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:56,549
you don't use it with the administration

1147
01:13:51,599 --> 01:14:01,469
admin only - this is quite an

1148
01:13:56,550 --> 01:14:03,719
interesting measure if we access it with

1149
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:07,199
the admin and is infected it will be the

1150
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:10,949
end but if we access it we limited

1151
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:15,869
privilege it will only affect part of

1152
01:14:10,949 --> 01:14:18,360
the information even though it might be

1153
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:22,348
equally malicious virus in some

1154
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:25,589
occasions and we know that this happens

1155
01:14:22,349 --> 01:14:29,480
in companies we know that we have an

1156
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:32,880
insurance that will cover for the

1157
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:35,249
problems as when we buy an automobile we

1158
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,329
know that we have to get out of the car

1159
01:14:35,249 --> 01:14:42,449
dealers with an insurance but sometimes

1160
01:14:38,329 --> 01:14:45,170
this also happens and this is more often

1161
01:14:42,449 --> 01:14:48,960
the case from this year onward

1162
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:51,360
what do we do in those situations what

1163
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:55,800
are the measures how do we sort it out

1164
01:14:51,360 --> 01:15:00,389
the first we can pray we can pray to

1165
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:02,760
Santa's Saint do this but we hadn't

1166
01:15:00,389 --> 01:15:05,880
implemented any technological measures

1167
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:09,059
candles may not work my grandmother when

1168
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:12,119
she lost anything she prayed to Saint

1169
01:15:09,059 --> 01:15:15,840
and Anthony and there was somebody that

1170
01:15:12,119 --> 01:15:18,119
would always find what was lost but here

1171
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:21,869
if we hadn't protected our system

1172
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:27,860
there's nothing we could do so grant a

1173
01:15:21,869 --> 01:15:34,579
failed but if we have a plan B that is

1174
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:34,579
just the handling of

1175
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:44,420
but today is still the very same simple

1176
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:48,290
and economical way full systems recovery

1177
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:50,420
please to that we may not have the most

1178
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:53,000
advanced technology to girl out the

1179
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:55,370
backup but if we have the weekly backup

1180
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:59,450
of the company's information we might

1181
01:15:55,370 --> 01:16:02,300
have only lose one week and we can

1182
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:03,950
continue with our life if we don't have

1183
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:06,050
backups our life will be more

1184
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:08,150
complicated something that we should

1185
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:11,000
take into account in relation to backups

1186
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:14,030
is to make sure that they can be

1187
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:16,730
restored there had been cases when

1188
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:19,580
having a problem and somebody would like

1189
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:21,830
to restore all those full restoration of

1190
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:27,620
the backup and files are either

1191
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:31,070
corrupted or not able to be opened so we

1192
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:33,470
should check that our backups can be

1193
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:37,460
restored we know what a contingency plan

1194
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:40,640
is backups can be within these plans a

1195
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:45,050
contingency plan is something that will

1196
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:48,800
allow us to continue our business if our

1197
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:51,650
office fire we need to have the

1198
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:54,380
possibility for this information using

1199
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:56,660
these premises to move it somewhere else

1200
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:59,120
and even the owner provisionally manner

1201
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:00,920
to go on working otherwise our business

1202
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:06,110
will be interrupted and we will no

1203
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:08,930
longer be able to make money and that's

1204
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:12,860
different to have a business

1205
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:15,620
continuation or not and the Windsors on

1206
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:20,150
fire was just a good example some of the

1207
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:21,980
companies that work there disclosed what

1208
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:26,320
else should we take into account risk

1209
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:29,950
management to identify the assets and

1210
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:35,509
potential threats if we have a server in

1211
01:17:29,950 --> 01:17:39,380
room connected to the power we can think

1212
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:40,490
that if we reduce a UPS system if there

1213
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,320
is an looked

1214
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:46,670
they cut which is not always the case

1215
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:50,750
but is possible then the server should

1216
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:52,910
rebuild or if in the middle of an

1217
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:56,110
operation of copier access in a

1218
01:17:52,910 --> 01:18:00,139
transaction the server may broke and

1219
01:17:56,110 --> 01:18:04,630
they might damage the ongoing activity

1220
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:09,800
there are many different examples floods

1221
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:12,140
unauthorized and country of the office

1222
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:17,390
so we should evaluate the risk in a very

1223
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:21,640
simple way is the potential impact on in

1224
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:28,510
euros multiplied per day likelihood to

1225
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:33,080
happen to try to implement oxygen

1226
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:35,750
devices in novice to mitigate a fire is

1227
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:38,990
absurd this very expensive system for

1228
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:41,930
very low risk a possibility of another

1229
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:44,179
impact might be high and then after this

1230
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:49,930
evaluation we should adopt the necessary

1231
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:55,460
measures several we know is connected

1232
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:59,510
the net we connect the server to the UPS

1233
01:18:55,460 --> 01:19:01,580
and we continue working with something

1234
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:05,840
there is very much in vogue now cyber

1235
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:08,330
insurance on cyber risk insurance

1236
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:11,060
policies this has been the case in

1237
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:15,670
United States for more than 20 years but

1238
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:19,100
in Spain only for the last two years it

1239
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:21,320
works as any other insurance if there

1240
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:24,950
are things that have a very high

1241
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:28,969
technological cost or we do not have the

1242
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:32,540
capacity on interest we can also solve

1243
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:34,940
this with the insurance and there are

1244
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:38,560
companies that when we contract those

1245
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:42,639
services they also offer additional

1246
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:46,480
services obg adequacy

1247
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:50,800
a security audits and those are added

1248
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:55,389
values to make our company more secure

1249
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:57,490
in this case all those measures that

1250
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:59,860
have been introduced into our

1251
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:02,860
presentation if we offer cyber security

1252
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:06,759
but we're really offering his trust and

1253
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:10,990
trust will generate business if you have

1254
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:13,810
a website that is totally secure that

1255
01:20:10,990 --> 01:20:16,179
manages the data personal data

1256
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:19,150
information appropriately

1257
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:21,190
I believe the monitor will switch off in

1258
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:23,219
one minute that's a message on the

1259
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:23,219
screen

1260
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:33,759
so if we have a secure website then our

1261
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:36,970
customers will highly value it and they

1262
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:41,140
will use it how can in theory our

1263
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:45,240
Institute help we've been working for

1264
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:48,940
several years and investing efforts that

1265
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:53,429
companies through our website might get

1266
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:53,429
all essential services

1267
01:20:55,349 --> 01:21:00,899
to have their own system their own

1268
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:05,309
security system to implement

1269
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:09,300
cybersecurity this is just a summary we

1270
01:21:05,309 --> 01:21:11,729
have the basic information kit were we

1271
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:15,809
rise the cybersecurity awareness of

1272
01:21:11,729 --> 01:21:18,570
companies with an implementation plan on

1273
01:21:15,809 --> 01:21:23,459
many occasions we don't know how to

1274
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:27,959
implement this plan we include the plan

1275
01:21:23,459 --> 01:21:30,959
that is deployed in different months

1276
01:21:27,959 --> 01:21:33,239
then we have a self-diagnose tool that

1277
01:21:30,959 --> 01:21:37,849
you've seen then security policies

1278
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:40,709
around 19 if I remember correctly

1279
01:21:37,849 --> 01:21:46,949
related to passwords to Wi-Fi access

1280
01:21:40,709 --> 01:21:52,909
very simple with very specific points of

1281
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:57,419
reference then we have the MLC for

1282
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:59,848
businesses self employees we usefully

1283
01:21:57,419 --> 01:22:06,289
organized three and four calls every

1284
01:21:59,849 --> 01:22:10,679
year interactive sectarian pathways with

1285
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:14,039
interactive videos devoted to the ten

1286
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:18,419
main industrial sectors industry offices

1287
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:20,459
health care where are their characters

1288
01:22:18,419 --> 01:22:22,919
Miguel the so called Miguel and Laura

1289
01:22:20,459 --> 01:22:28,129
through videos and questioners and

1290
01:22:22,919 --> 01:22:31,469
interactive play they speak about

1291
01:22:28,129 --> 01:22:33,239
security according to the different

1292
01:22:31,469 --> 01:22:36,840
industrial sectors than would have a

1293
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:39,299
serious game that is a video game but it

1294
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,149
teaches about cybersecurity

1295
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:47,280
I don't know I'm quite old even I look

1296
01:22:42,149 --> 01:22:51,750
younger but Carmen Sandiego is it ring a

1297
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:58,320
bell Carmen San do to you

1298
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:59,730
it was a game that taught geography it

1299
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:02,759
was for youngsters and it's quite

1300
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:10,519
similar it tries to teach on

1301
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:13,620
cybersecurity contact point for

1302
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:18,140
companies where you can send your doubts

1303
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:22,559
or queries only related to cybersecurity

1304
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:25,800
you cannot ask how do I contact TV will

1305
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:30,140
be exact or but you and ask questions

1306
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:32,790
about run some web those are free

1307
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:35,490
services because this is the public

1308
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:39,030
Spanish public administration and the

1309
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:45,480
ransomware service where we can decipher

1310
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:48,450
almost 90% of crypto infections and a

1311
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:52,139
cybersecurity catalog where we have more

1312
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:56,910
than 5000 solutions and services related

1313
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:59,310
to cybersecurity if any of you need to

1314
01:23:56,910 --> 01:24:02,160
know about a company that carries out

1315
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:06,380
the security audits you can access this

1316
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:10,910
catalog and you can choose and filter by

1317
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:15,000
geographical areas you have multiple

1318
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:16,620
ways to get to the right company that

1319
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,650
will offer you the right service you

1320
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:23,070
have information in this section protect

1321
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:26,460
your company from entry way and if you

1322

now I believe and I mean they are seeing

1325
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:40,460
the intima Cassie Cassie what us good

1326
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,460
morning

1327
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:43,460
see

1328
01:24:46,449 --> 01:24:53,509
for an SME or a micro company with

1329
01:24:49,969 --> 01:24:58,369
limited budgets imagine that they can't

1330
01:24:53,510 --> 01:25:01,790
outsource computing security services

1331
01:24:58,369 --> 01:25:04,790
how safe and secure can Google or

1332
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:07,250
Dropbox be in order to handle documents

1333
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:14,630
among them confidential documents that's

1334
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:17,179
a good question and as for the data that

1335
01:25:14,630 --> 01:25:20,929
you can upload in order to work in a

1336
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:23,540
collaborative manner our recommendation

1337
01:25:20,929 --> 01:25:26,810
is that all those documents that are

1338
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:29,500
uploaded to the cloud need to be

1339
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:33,040
encrypted or coded if they are indeed

1340
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:37,280
confidential documents if for example

1341
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:40,190
you're high schoolers right yeah our

1342
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:43,610
confidential information has to do with

1343
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:49,159
the exams basically but let's imagine

1344
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:51,699
that you have a student with PDA and

1345
01:25:49,159 --> 01:25:56,750
let's make use that you although the

1346
01:25:51,699 --> 01:25:58,790
students record all that information

1347
01:25:56,750 --> 01:26:02,119
needs to be duly protected so my

1348
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:05,719
recommendation to you is to upload coded

1349
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:10,909
or encrypted information can we do that

1350
01:26:05,719 --> 01:26:13,460
can we encrypt using a free software no

1351
01:26:10,909 --> 01:26:15,530
you have some tools like Bravo serv

1352
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:20,330
aircraft that allow you to encrypt the

1353
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:22,960
info before you upload it and if you do

1354
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:26,030
so you're protecting yourself from

1355
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:28,400
providers or suppliers we know that 100%

1356
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:30,409
security doesn't exist but basically

1357
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:32,480
you're shielding your information and

1358
01:26:30,409 --> 01:26:37,750
preventing others from accessing unless

1359
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:37,750
they have the key words so Google

1360
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:45,360
couldn't be held accountable right while

1361
01:26:42,389 --> 01:26:48,329
you would need to revise Google

1362
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:51,119
agreements but since this is a free

1363
01:26:48,329 --> 01:26:54,150
service they cannot be held accountable

1364
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:59,119
for the data contained in those

1365
01:26:54,150 --> 01:27:01,679
documents so that the security is

1366
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:05,400
transferred to the provider but if

1367
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:06,210
someone does phishing and extracts the

1368
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:08,670
passwords

1369
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:11,329
I'm afraid Google has nothing to do

1370
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:15,739
someone has stolen the passwords and

1371
01:27:11,329 --> 01:27:15,739
Google cannot be held accountable

1372
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:29,990
good morning you've been talking about

1373
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:34,660
protection measures you have been to

1374
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:39,200
mention of one for example using an a

1375
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:41,110
symmetrical encrypted email can can it

1376
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:47,300
be a good protective measure

1377
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:50,420
well emails emails when created weren't

1378
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:52,880
implemented with security measures

1379
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:55,520
because back then it wasn't considered

1380
01:27:52,880 --> 01:28:00,710
to be necessary but unfortunately the

1381
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:03,890
email protocol hasn't been encrypted the

1382
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:07,460
protocol itself hasn't been encrypted so

1383
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:12,130
what can we use so that that service

1384
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:18,500
email service is secure well to use a

1385
01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:22,250
symmetrical encryption keys in order to

1386
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:25,700
protect our email messages and we can

1387
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:29,890
use certificates to sign our emails

1388
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:35,269
those measures have a bit of a

1389
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:39,140
complexity and this is like what should

1390
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:40,970
I use whatsapp telegram or sign oh how

1391
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:43,400
can I make a choice you'll probably go

1392
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:45,890
for the easier option if you tell the

1393
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:48,799
user I'm going to give you my public key

1394
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:50,150
word because I'm going to send you my

1395
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,060
encrypted

1396
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:55,460
my message is encrypted you need to

1397
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:59,630
download a plug-in and you need to

1398
01:28:55,460 --> 01:29:02,360
integrate my password so that you can

1399
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:06,560
read the encrypted messages and

1400
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:10,040
sometimes this processes are considered

1401
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:12,160
to be overly complex and that's a

1402
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:16,519
problem it's an obstacle to

1403
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:18,900
implementation and we need to ensure

1404
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:22,050
easier options

1405
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:25,980
but of course security comes with

1406
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:27,750
complexity and I like to tell you that

1407
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:32,280
we are currently developing some

1408
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:34,980
guidelines for the use of PGP precisely

1409
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:38,820
and we will polish these guidelines and

1410
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:42,719
the upcoming months any further

1411
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:45,480
questions or queries well if that's not

1412
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:48,240
the case I hope you have found my

1413
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:51,200
workshop of interest and I like to thank

1414
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:51,200
you all for attending
