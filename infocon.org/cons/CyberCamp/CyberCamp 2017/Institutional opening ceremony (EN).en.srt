be dealing where

83
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,380
during these days with all those more

84
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:14,760
than 20 activities nobody can question

85
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,950
than the Internet is present in every

86
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:20,430
part of our lives but during these days

87
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:24,330
we need to reflect upon whether we are

88
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:27,660
using the Internet correctly if we are

89
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,330
really aware of the protection we need

90
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,590
and the security we need online and how

91
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:38,039
we can protect ourselves what we can do

92
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:41,520
because going online is a lot more and

93
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,490
there are some things we need to know to

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,159
use the Internet in reasonable safe and

95
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,470
responsible manner we all use the

96
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,860
Internet but the question is are we

97
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,200
using it well so these days are great

98
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,169

99
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,590

so this is a great opportunity from the

171
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,018
educational perspective as this is a

172
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,769
training activity and we totally

173
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:40,139
identify ourselves with its goals

174
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:45,720
discover your capabilities is one of the

175
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:49,500
mottos that we have at the original

176
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,720
ministry for education new information

177
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:58,290
and communication technologies have a

178
00:10:51,720 --> 00:11:01,019
great potential and I'm sure your

179
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:05,730
abilities and your knowledge and those

180
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:08,940
technologies is huge and Cybercom will

181
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,759
surely give you tools in order to boost

182
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,870
that potential you already have and

183
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,839
consolidates

184
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:20,579
your knowledge there is something we

185
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:26,930
cannot forget in this field the

186
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:30,630
educational field is also involved in

187
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:33,000
training good professionals you know

188
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,490
that to be competitive with other

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,250
economies in the world this is a great

190
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,990
opportunity and this is another goal

191
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,980
that we share with the Secretary of

192
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:47,120
State and in Sabre which is the safe and

193
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:50,069
responsible use of a social media and

194
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,620
communication networks it is very

195
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:55,860
important to protect ourselves from our

196
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,069
vulnerability to protect the privacy of

197
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:03,329
minor children as you will probably

198
00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:06,449
understand this is basic and it's really

199
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:11,758
our intention we're really determined to

200
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:15,990
continue doing so and even if it's it

201
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:18,870
happens very Sultan it's true that

202
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:22,170
sometimes we see cases of cyber stalking

203
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,750
in our schools and this is an issue that

204
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,149
we are concerned about we won't tolerate

205
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,600
this kind of behavior as we are

206
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:32,399
responsible for protecting our children

207
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,920
so we are responsible for as a

208
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,450
responsible use of

209
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:43,740
the social media and also to have tools

210
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:50,190
that enable us to say no to set limits

211
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:53,760
to stalking coming from social media

212
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,560
which have really devastating effects so

213
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,560
enjoy yourself so this is a unique

214
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,449
opportunity we have in Cantabria and in

215
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,890

for their preparation work and all the

239
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:19,260

this event and being really committed

243
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:33,630
with the activities that are being

244
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:38,550
developed this year's edition is focused

245
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:41,460
on three basic goals the first one is to

246
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:44,150
become a platform in order to identify

247
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,370
the future careers that will be

248
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,530
needed in order to establish a bridge

249
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:52,070
with young talents in the field of

250
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:55,400
cybersecurity second to place families

251
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:59,590
at the core of the friendly and

252
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:02,290
responsible use of new technologies via

253
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:07,700
awareness raising and dissemination

254
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:11,540
programs and thirdly to encourage our

255
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:16,040
youngsters ambition in order to build a

256
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:19,730
compact and robust society prepared for

257
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:23,949
the new digital era this is going to be

258
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:26,450
combined with talks workshops for

259
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:30,380
competitions and educational activities

260
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:32,240
for the public at large so cyber Camp

261
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,620
must be the meeting point for cyber

262
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:42,710
security where all members of society

263
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:48,850
have a say the creation of cyber social

264
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:52,310
awareness which is diverse and strong

265
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:55,970
for that purpose since eva has become

266
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:59,380
vital in order to tackle cyber security

267
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:04,700
from a brave and multifactorial

268
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:09,560
perspective the cyber attacks on people

269
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,510
and companies have been fought against

270
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:16,130
by them and they also play a fundamental

271
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:19,040
role in socially articulating the

272
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:23,230
vulnerabilities of the network I want to

273
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,530
remind you the free-of-charge hotline

274
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:29,690
which is confidential and addressed to

275
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:32,689
children and which has to do with the

276
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:34,310
responsible and safe use of the internet

277
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,490
which has to do for example with

278
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:40,880
conflicts of privacy and reputation

279
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:43,630
abuse inappropriate contents dangerous

280
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,240
communities and issues regarding

281
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:49,450
protection of devices fraud and many

282
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,450
more

283
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:59,220
we also address parents professionals

284
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:02,290
educators and guardians who provide

285
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,040
assistance and protections in the

286
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:09,069
households and schools so I please ask

287
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,829
you to disseminate the use of this very

288
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:16,178
important tool and I want to give out

289
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:19,720
now an essential message the gender

290
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:24,970
perspective and the feminization in the

291
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:28,150
cybersecurity field is a mandatory way

292
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:32,650
forward it is in all cases and in all

293
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:36,690
sectors but we wouldn't be helping

294
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:41,110
ourselves it would didn't make an effort

295
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:47,170
to include women and fill in a growing

296
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:49,809
field such as cyber cyber security and

297
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:54,790
leave the woman's role in a role of

298
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:58,120
apathy and discrimination only 11% of

299
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:03,639
the people involved in cyber security in

300
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:09,370
our country are women in Europe where

301
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:12,190
the flag of diversity should be flying

302
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:14,860
high this diversity is very small and

303
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:18,340
this percentage hasn't changed in the

304
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,080
past few years although it is becoming

305
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,080
more and more important to increase

306
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,899
gender diversity in the new technology

307
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,629
niches and this is not only about the

308
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:32,080
technology we are talking about opening

309
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:37,410
the windows of the new digital ecosystem

310
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:41,710
which sometimes has two biggest NIF of

311
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:47,890
masculine testosterone we need to move

312
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:51,850
forwards avoid digital shortcuts for our

313
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,790
consumption Society because sometimes we

314
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,918
are slow and coward if you allow me in

315
00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,610
order to adapt to the 21st century

316
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,110
challenges so technology development

317
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,620
should be in

318
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:07,000
compatible with the axis of

319
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:13,540
technological testosterone I was

320
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,150
referring to so cyber trust and cyber

321
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,610
confidence is the way to go in order to

322
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:22,600
build a smart spain which is what we

323
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:26,949
want to build via the digital strategy a

324
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:29,379
country that can see clearly where the

325
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:32,049
digital transformation should go and not

326
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:35,860
the other way around I am convinced that

327
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:38,980
this event is a wonderful platform in

328
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,860
order to build the country we want so I

329
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,470
encouraged you to design with us the

330
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,389
future roadmap for our country so thank

331
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,250
you very much for your attention and

332
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:51,369
