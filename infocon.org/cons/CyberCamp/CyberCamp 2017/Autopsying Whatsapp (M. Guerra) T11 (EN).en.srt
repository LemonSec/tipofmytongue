1
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:28,019
hear me hello good morning everybody

2
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:32,920
we're here noon I hope you had a coffee

3
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:37,330
to put up with this next two hours I

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:42,300
hope I'm going to be interesting for you

5
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:46,750
even though it's technical let's do it

6
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:50,099
nice and cool and I hope it will be fun

7
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:53,970
my name is mater Manuel Guerra

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,220
and forensic analysts in the central

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:01,809
analytical office of the National Police

10
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:04,030
the editor of glider thought he is so

11
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:07,630
when I have ideas for articles and a

12
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:12,549
half time I publish these glider

13
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:16,419
articles I have a bit of a cold and my

14
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:19,210
voice is not really okay I'm going to

15
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,100
talk about forensic analysis in whatsapp

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:25,389
why what's up

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:28,869
why not telegram or facebook facebook

18
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:31,780
chat or other messenger applications

19
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:34,240
well what's up today in Spain and in

20
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,640
Europe is the messaging application

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,640
which is the most used in the whole of

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,490
Europe and in many countries so it's the

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,100
messaging application I is the most used

24
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,199
so that's where we have to make more

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,949
efforts to know and to learn how it

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:55,149
works in order to do you have evidence

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:58,840
that can be valid in a trial if what's

28
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:02,829
up is the most popular application it's

29
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,259
the application that is used by the most

30
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:07,149
the highest number of criminals it's

31
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:12,100
basic so you have to make more efforts

32
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:15,520
to have mmm crime evidence out of the

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,459
application in a correct way that's the

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,050
basic motivation of choosing whatsapp

35
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:22,120
and not and not other applications

36
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,480
another oblique mot evasion is more

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,570
personal apart from what I just said

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,519
what's up has a handicap it's one of the

39
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:34,750
applications that is

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,110
stated but more updated in a periodic

41
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:43,390
way other messenger applications are not

42
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:45,760
updated that often whereas what's up in

43
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:49,690
three to four months we can have three

44
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,470
four even five critical updates what is

45
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:58,120
a critical update it's this update is

46
00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:00,010
going to modify the form in which we use

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,480
whatsapp I'm not talking about a user

48
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:08,739
but about a forensic so users are okay

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:12,549
but at forensic level there are radical

50
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:16,320
changes and we have to change totally in

51
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,760
the way in which we interpret an image

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:23,140
text it's another motivation we have to

53
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:26,380
be updated 100% updated I'm not going to

54
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,510
explain how whatsup works and then you

55
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,549
can forget about it it's not the case

56
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:33,880
because in three months this is going to

57
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:37,750
change again and we have to refine and

58
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,460
to be updated with whatsapp we cannot

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,420
start building the house

60
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,130
starting by there the ceiling so what is

61
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,059
the first thing we have to do with an

62
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:52,570
electronic digital evidence if you were

63
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,730
with me on Thursday you can imagine what

64
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,890
could happen but if you weren't not

65
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,600
there what is the first thing we'd have

66
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,350
to do without digital or electronic

67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:05,650
evidence give me ideas what's the first

68
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:08,980
thing to do to preserve it preserve the

69
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,950
evidence to preserve its integrity what

70
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:16,988
does it mean if today I don't have the

71
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:19,890
phone if we we get this phone and it has

72
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:23,679
a specific information inside the day

73
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,419
this information gets to the court it

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,450
has to be the same evidence we cannot

75
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:32,080
manipulate or alter that information if

76
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,920
it says jja this is the database the day

77
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,010
we go to trial that database should be

78
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,000
called JJ a the same we have to

79
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:44,210
guarantee the integrity of the evidence

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,800
it's our job

81
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:51,169
basically but what happens digital

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,440
evidence especially in mobile phones

83
00:04:51,169 --> 00:05:00,409
these are very volatile evidence more

84
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:03,259
than the DNA or our blood oh we believe

85
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,750
that this is very solid

86
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:08,270
no it's volatile not just about the

87
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,389
place way they're stored in a ram memory

88
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,609
or a hard drive because of the shape and

89
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:19,070
form in which they're stored for

90
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:24,759
instance see if today I take this

91
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:29,509
telephone and I put it in a sealed bag

92
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:32,000
if the the phone is switched on with a

93
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,820
data connection in a remote way a user

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,330
or another person can be connected to

95
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,630
the gmail account and say that this is

96
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,609
the phone has been stolen and then all

97
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,820
the evidence in the device is going to

98
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:52,210
be removed so we cannot get information

99
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:55,849
in from inside of this device anymore

100
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:59,810
the scientific policemen they go to this

101
00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:04,190
crime scene and they take and the DNA or

102
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,930
the blood evidence we need to have

103
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,199
digital evidence we've seen it in many

104
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,810
movies we have here a crime scene with

105
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,389
blood and we are not going to clean it

106
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,669
we're not going to touch it we don't

107
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:19,659
want to touch the evidence electronic

108
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:23,090
evidence cannot be touched we can't have

109
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:28,789
a mobile connected to the Internet and

110
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:30,979
start using it we to see in seeing what

111
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:36,530
are the conversations he's had and I'm

112
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:41,800
an ogre to use that criminals phone they

113
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:45,198
have to do a good custody and these are

114
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,699
life elements they are switched on and

115
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,530
we need to operate them in a different

116
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:54,740
way than the way we use a harddrive this

117
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,529
if this is on it's carrying out

118
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,860
careening out processes of if you can we

119
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:00,469
can

120
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,509
switch it off if this device before we

121
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:04,430
get the information out if we can switch

122
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:06,560
it off we switch it off otherwise we

123
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,389
will lose information sometimes we can't

124
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,939
switch it off there's no pin there's no

125
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:14,090
password there's a risk of not being

126
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:16,729
able to switch it switch it on again so

127
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,479
we can configure it in the plane mode

128
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:23,000
maybe I like I don't know the unblocking

129
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,789
pin I put it in the plane mode and

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,590
nobody's going to alter the content in a

131
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:34,128
remote way sometimes we can't do that

132
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:37,549
because if we have the unblocking code I

133
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:42,560
can't put it in plane mode I can use

134
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:47,389
this type of packs it's a metal bag it's

135
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,460
it's with metal threads so any type of

136
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:56,509
mobile phone or electronic device that

137
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:59,599
we can put inside the bag will be it's

138
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:01,699
not going to have network coverage so

139
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,469
this phone we can put it in the plane

140
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,509
mode but it can be connected to the

141
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:08,870
outside world was where we're going to

142
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:11,750
avoid anybody removing the information

143
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,150
but this is that's got a problem if this

144
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,069
is connected to a 3G I put it in the bag

145
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,888
and it's going to have no network

146
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:21,199
connection its tries to connect that the

147
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,080
antenna is going to be put into maximum

148
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:28,610
power so that it can connect so it's

149
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,520
going to to use a lot of the battery

150
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,649
power so if we are trying to avoid that

151
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,838
the telephone switches off and we put it

152
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:38,000
in the bag and it's going to switch off

153
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,159
very very soon because there is no more

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,240
battery left and that's a pro there's a

155
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,250
problem we need an external battery the

156
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,230
telephones continues more battery but we

157
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,180
are using an external battery so there's

158
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,269
no problem these are details to take

159
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,399
into account what I'm going to explain

160
00:08:53,269 --> 00:09:00,470
today we can't be perfect but this is

161
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:02,570
basic to treat digital evidence in a

162
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:08,029
perfect way if we don't do this

163
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:10,480
otherwise the rest is useless see me

164
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:19,939
Makino gives it a circus burger

165
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:21,889
so what is forensics IT application of

166
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,360
scientific and analytical techniques

167
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,850
specialized to technology

168
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,560
infrastructures that allowed to identify

169
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,730
preserve analyze and present data that

170
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,729
are valid within a trial

171
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:37,790
what is forensic IT forensic I see is to

172
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,060
get information out of an electronic

173
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,189
device in the an adequate way in an

174
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:47,420
appropriate way we need to manipulate

175
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:51,050
this evidence it's surprising to

176
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:54,339
manipulate evidence oh my god I'd like

177
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,649
to explain this with a more traditional

178
00:09:54,339 --> 00:10:01,759
metaphor a dead person

179
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:06,850
we need to do an autopsy so the forensic

180
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:10,699
doctor has to manipulate the caliper

181
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:13,699
with incisions with a scalpel and see

182
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:17,089
what's the state of the dead organs if

183
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:20,120
they're affected or not to determine the

184
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:22,339
reasoner and the of the death cutting

185
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,110
the tissue of a dead person it means

186
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:27,470
that you're manipulating the body of

187
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,569
that person okay but it's the only way

188
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,279
to open the body into no how's the

189
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:34,610
inside of the human being there's no

190
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,250
other way through there several years

191
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,050
ago

192
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:44,329
there was a theory a digital evidence

193
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:45,099
cannot be altered in any way we cannot

194
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:47,599
touch it

195
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,459
we cannot interact it we cannot

196
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,620
manipulate it we cannot get the

197
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:57,258
information out but you can never do

198
00:10:51,620 --> 00:11:01,189
that in now we have all types of devices

199
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:04,970
and we have to change this idea we have

200
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:08,209
to manipulate or handle it doesn't mean

201
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,670
tampering handling or manipulating or

202
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:13,189
touching it means to do scientific

203
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,390
processes but it doesn't mean tampering

204
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:18,910
and this should be

205
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,939
a fundamental essential processes and

206
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,400
the less invasive way always with the

207
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:29,080
good tools

208
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:37,000
nobody would imagine that a forensic

209
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:39,010
doctor will use a chainsaw for the

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,570
autopsy so you need to choose the best

211
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,870
tool and everything has to be written

212
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,750
down you have to get the mobile phone to

213
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,370
get the information out I have to write

214
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,710
you're going to route a mobile phone

215
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,860
you're manipulating the evidence yes I'm

216
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,910
manipulating the evidence output I'm

217
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,650
contaminating it and I'm routing it

218
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,569
because it's the only method that exists

219
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:02,370
today to get the information out of this

220
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:05,040
mobile phone but I have to write it down

221
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,990
sometimes we have to manipulate the

222
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,349
evidence but never tamper and never

223
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:15,390
contaminate the evidence so I explained

224
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:19,840
how that works let's start what's up a

225
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:22,870
forensic analysis - what what's up I'm

226
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,520
going to explain what I'm going to do at

227
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:31,300
the end we'll have ten minutes for

228
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:34,180
questions you can ask any question well

229
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:40,930
you can take notes and at the end we can

230
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:42,640
have time for Q&A I'm going to talk

231
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,719
about I know maybe you have another

232
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,660
viewpoint so we can debate and discuss

233
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,810
about this let's start

234
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:55,000
what's the however smart phone works I'm

235
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,180
doing talking about Android because it's

236
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,500
the system and I know better and I can

237
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:08,680
explain about it on your left the

238
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:12,270
Android battery the pile on top the

239
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,709
applications layer was whatsapp Facebook

240
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:18,310
tinder and all these applications that

241
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:20,650
we use every day well yes you're

242
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,339
bluffing because I mentioned tinder then

243
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,870
we have the Opera top operating system

244
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:29,320
Windows 10 Windows 7 that's the layer

245
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:34,540
for the application framework then

246
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:38,740
we have the library's sorry the firmware

247
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:42,910
the assembler and the hardware it's the

248
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:46,330
physical device the hardware in the

249
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:50,530
various layers well you see the

250
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:53,590
operating system layer Linux etc you

251
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:56,170
know the Android is a Linux oh wow

252
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,030
I didn't know if I don't I've never used

253
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,140
Linux what's your what's your telephone

254
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:06,220
and Android well you are using Linux

255
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:11,140
it's a bit strange it's a little

256
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:14,110
difficult to understand how and how the

257
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,270
structure of mobile phone is made but

258
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,830
it's a listen is your way of

259
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,550
understanding we have the applications

260
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,800
layer the magic layer and my heart where

261
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,290
my device we can apply this definition

262
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,930
which is easier to understand the magic

263
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,819
layer all that you can imagine that can

264
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,579
be done is done it's magic and

265
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,230
everything's control work perfectly well

266
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,450
and many people think that mobile phones

267
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,000
work because of magic you can do

268
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,430
anything you want you can manipulate any

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,740
whatsapp conversation because it's magic

270
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:50,199
we'll see what we can and we cannot do

271
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:53,140
really this is more important it's good

272
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,970
for explain how an whatsup works

273
00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:00,760
what's up has Java Android works with

274
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:05,760
virtual machines of Java Virtual Machine

275
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:09,640
is a single virtual machine in which an

276
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,580
limited number of applications run in

277
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,590
the same virtual machine there are many

278
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,870
applications in a single virtual machine

279
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:21,250
this is the Java machine the typical one

280
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:24,160
but the dalvik machine which is used by

281
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:28,240
Android doesn't work in this way so this

282
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:31,089
is complication allows it's difficult

283
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,460
for the Android applications for each

284
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:36,040
application there is a virtual machine

285
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,070
that is different from the others if I

286
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,260
have to what's up what's up as its own

287
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:43,000
dalvik virtual machine Facebook has is

288
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:45,460
its own dalvik virtual

289
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,610
machine totally independent one from the

290
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:52,270
other this is a complication for us and

291
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,460
then the memories of the part where they

292
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,829
keep and save the information

293
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,560
this is segmented and divided from the

294
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:02,350
rest of the applications whatsapp has

295
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,810
its own single part four of mammal bait

296
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,090
the Facebook has a single part of the

297
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,619
memory and they can't see what has

298
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,270
happened in happening in the other

299
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,520
memories so Facebook cannot get

300
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:16,540
information from what's up and whatsapp

301
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:19,120
cannot have the access to the list of

302
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,750
contacts if we haven't authorized this

303
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:38,290
application so because this typology is

304
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:40,480
quite good for security we have an

305
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,300
additional problem the property

306
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,610
management per user each application has

307
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,740
its own independent user I brought from

308
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,750
virtual machines each one has its own

309
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:54,940
application for example on your right

310
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:56,620
there's ten thousand two three four

311
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,420
that's the user for each of the

312
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,080
applications that are installed in our

313
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,349
Android what's up has a user Facebook

314
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,480
has a user and tinder has another user

315
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:11,619
then nobody wants to know and what's

316
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,380
interesting here is if we can access the

317
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:16,060
Facebook application we cannot access to

318
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:20,589
whites of a clip application because

319
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:24,790
they're totally independent we can see

320
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:27,188
it better here this is the file we have

321
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:33,850
whatsapp file within the telephone and

322
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:36,430
we see you 0 a1 98 this is the user that

323
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:39,939
operates this specific what's up in this

324
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:46,150
mobile phone the user name is this one a

325
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:47,980
1 9 8 in facebook is a 1 8 oh this are

326
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,320
different users but it's in the same

327
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,780
mobile phone if you know the lineups you

328
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,909
know that each user can only access his

329
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,080
or her part of memory the Facebook

330
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,320
cannot access

331
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,678
sup and what's up cannot access wait

332
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,529
Facebook so the root user is important

333
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:09,610
yes I'm rooted in my phone I'm a hacker

334
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:15,399
well that's why the root user is

335
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:18,990
activated it is activated as a user I'm

336
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:22,299
just activating the you the root user

337
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,010
so roots can access the space are the

338
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:26,080
rest of the users without no prob with

339
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:31,029
their problems that's the only advantage

340
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:35,158
of being root to root a phone doesn't

341
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:38,500
make it go faster I can and nobody can

342
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,090
hacked if you are a root is that you can

343
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,730
access to specific parts that you

344
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:46,418
couldn't access but you can have many

345
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:49,840
problems your phone can become a rock

346
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:54,909
and it could be useless because somebody

347
00:18:49,840 --> 00:19:00,639
has manipulated the phone lately we

348
00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:02,230
can't find so many rooted phones people

349
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:05,379
thought that was a very good thing to

350
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,950
root the phones but now the normal users

351
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:11,679
don't root any the mobile phones anymore

352
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:14,669
because they don't want to lose it they

353
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,860
are Chinese phones that are already

354
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:21,190
rooted by default but root means to

355
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,750
access to any system user it's the only

356
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,720
thing that we can do with that if the

357
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:28,510
phone is not rooted then it's the our

358
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,559
tusk for a forensic analysis is going to

359
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:34,029
get more complicated interests

360
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:37,690
directories you're taking photos but

361
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:41,049
it's ok this is a public talk I will

362
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:43,899
disseminate it this is public so video

363
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:47,379
is recorded if you want this

364
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:51,760
presentation I can give it to you so

365
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,830
interest directories when you will see

366
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,639
the presentation another day you will

367
00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:01,689
see where you can find for information

368
00:19:56,639 --> 00:20:05,229
the what's up core is in a file called

369
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:08,679
data data come dot what's up all the

370
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,730
Android as application starts with dark

371
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,320
data

372
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:17,020
installation apk they exact the dot exit

373
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:21,550
in Android is caption in this file data

374
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:25,300
up a PP come what's up to apk that's

375
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:28,360
good if to see if whatsapp has a malware

376
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:31,360
we can get the installation apk and we

377
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,340
can see if it's a real apk way or is

378
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,320
it's another one that's been manipulated

379
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,439
all the applications that we install in

380
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,659
our phone will be saved in that

381
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:46,540
installation apk which is a database in

382
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:50,530
that file then the famous the encrypted

383
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:52,870
database backup if you have an Android

384
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:55,720
you will see that in your SD card in

385
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:59,379
your internal card you can see that SD

386
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:02,290
card whatsapp databases there you will

387
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:05,380
find the the encrypted based databases

388
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:09,149
and then the transferred multimedia

389
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:13,180
files they are in the SD card

390
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:16,510
what's up media that's where we're going

391
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:19,120
to find the information in those

392
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:22,360
directories I'm going to share my

393
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,419
presentation no problem this is public

394
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,629
everything is it's fantastic but how can

395
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,060
we access to whatsapp database how can

396
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,340
we access this database that's inside

397
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,770
the phone in an internal system

398
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,169
partition where they use of the and we

399
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,300
don't know that password how can we

400
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,880
access I'm going to explain that now

401
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,460
each telephone it so it's a universe

402
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,530
itself it I'm not going to give you a

403
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,600
tricks for each phone because each phone

404
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,000
and the same phone with different route

405
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,050
will work and run in a different way

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,870
depends on the settings if it's rotate

407
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,909
it's a ADB it's infinite it depends on

408
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,550
the settings on in the phone I cannot

409
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:06,100
explain everything but I can explain the

410
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:09,909
most basic ways that allow you to get

411
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:14,620
the database out the goal is to access a

412
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:16,330
database to get to this database and you

413
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,360
have to get there there's no other way

414
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:23,500
and we have to test the less invasive

415
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:26,080
method first the cheap off technique

416
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,889
it's very invasive you can get out the

417
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,809
memory chip out and then we need another

418
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:34,059
system to get the information out it's

419
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:37,690
totally invasive if you find a less

420
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:40,090
invasive with a DB connection first we

421
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,700
try to connect through a DB before

422
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,189
destroying the phone so from less

423
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:50,919
invasive to more invasive techniques

424
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:57,240
okay let's start first problem this

425
00:22:50,919 --> 00:23:01,360
smartphone is blocked first problem how

426
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:05,529
where the SIM PIN if the telephone

427
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:10,809
operator ping and and it's blocked and

428
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:15,909
you you don't know the unblock in design

429
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:20,950
the unblocking free sentence the

430
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:23,769
unbroken pin facial recognition that's

431
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:32,559
another way of blocking it it could be a

432
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:36,389
photo the fingerprint recognition to

433
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:41,440
unblock that telephone that's typical

434
00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:45,899
how can we solve this problems the SIM

435
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:49,690
PIN SIM card PIN it's quite complex to

436
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:52,239
violate the same security if we stop a

437
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:55,539
telephone and we have to introduce the

438
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:59,769
pin we can get the SIM card out no

439
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:01,720
problem you get the same out what maybe

440
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:06,129
we'll get into the memory chip and we're

441
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,820
going to eliminate what's inside no it's

442
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:12,009
no problem some some telephones clean

443
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:15,519
insert a valid SIM card to start well I

444
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:17,200
can use these white cards this SIM card

445
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,240
with no information inside and the

446
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,440
telephone will start with no problem

447
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,340
even though there's nothing in the SIM

448
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:28,570
card so that's a and that's another real

449
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:31,330
problem then the unblocking pin or the

450
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:34,460
unblocking a design the pattern

451
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:37,429
even though there's no simcha pin I can

452
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:41,000
have a de téléphone pin you have to do a

453
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:47,840
pattern but it's a number it's a pin

454
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:52,490
code 0 0 0 0 or 1 2 3 4 most smartphones

455
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:56,149
have this pin you can say see even the

456
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:59,200
last pin that's been typed and if it's a

457
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:02,840
pattern we can test another River

458
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,450
revolutionary method you test all the

459
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,760
patterns well a person has done it I

460
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,250
don't know who's that and aloy found it

461
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,270
this paper was on the floor in thier

462
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,950
Agathe if the person who's written this

463
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:19,850
and there were two or three more pages

464
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:24,590
it took a long time to test the

465
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:27,800
different patterns no no no no no I know

466
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:30,800
when it's no and when it's yes how much

467
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:33,440
time it would was left if you see that

468
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:38,139
we'll never know if he succeeded and

469
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:42,020
while trying to unblock the mobile phone

470
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,360
there are technical methods but this is

471
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:48,879
according well depends on each device in

472
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:51,290
old iPhones the five the six versions

473
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,790
with what four numbers there was a pin

474
00:25:51,290 --> 00:26:00,440
to unblock it and if you fail three

475
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:04,040
times the phone was blocked but the

476
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:07,310
iPhone guys inserted it small failure

477
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:10,100
you just write your PIN twice okay the

478
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:13,490
third time you switch off you switch on

479
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:15,260
and the number of resets started from

480
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,030
zero so it was an infinite number of

481
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:21,800
trials there was a thousand

482
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:23,690
possibilities 9999 so you can you can

483
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,970
switch ON switch off switch ON switch

484
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,640
off and every time there's a reset on

485
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:32,300
the number of trials that you can use

486
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,180
for your pin so it was quite easy in

487
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,280
half an hour of 45 minutes according to

488
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:41,140
your speed you can unblock and you got

489
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,139
the pin it was very basic

490
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:49,910
for max you can push the root button

491
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:54,290
many times and you can get in so Mac

492
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:58,010
people well they they they want their

493
00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:01,460
users to be comfortable for the root

494
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:03,980
passwords you just pushed seven times on

495
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,450
the button in the last versions of Mac

496
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,460
and Android well this has been corrected

497
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,809
but in fact they wanted that their uses

498
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,790
to be okay with their phones

499
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:13,280
we have to be updated and know about

500
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:15,620
this because that was seven working for

501
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,220
72 hours and we can access a mobile

502
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,809
phone that we couldn't use in any other

503
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,720
way I'm not just going to talk about

504
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:26,059
Apple but Android had this problems too

505
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,020
there was an Android version with a

506
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:33,470
hundred 12112 and if the block telephone

507
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:38,030
doesn't call one one two this is the

508
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:41,240
emergency call with one one two pushing

509
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:43,639
the Menu menu button go back and you got

510
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,070
to the unblocked menu of the mobile

511
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,270
phone and once you got into the menu you

512
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,570
could do anything

513
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:54,830
so that was an error in the phone in the

514
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:57,678
Android system very small faults allow

515
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:59,659
us to get into the mobile phone so each

516
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,390
mobile phone has a different type of

517
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,120
access so you have to look for it you

518
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,780
can push and press any buttons you can

519
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,840
switch it off

520
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,629
switch it on and miracle you can access

521
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,909
the menu and that's what we really need

522
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,640
we need to access the menu once we are

523
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:22,340
there we can do anything there are more

524
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:25,880
complex methods in Android wear the foot

525
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:31,639
butter you can do a back up all of the

526
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:34,280
content of the memory it's the system

527
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,669
memory content you do the backup of

528
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,500
internal memory of the phone and you

529
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:40,190
can't get into the phone but with this

530
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:45,169
backup

531
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:48,020
there's the unblocking

532
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:50,240
pattern within a file there's a list of

533
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:55,899
hashes this one

534
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:59,509
in the file you will see this number but

535
00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:02,299
there's this table and here it tells you

536
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:05,600
what's a pattern if we had this fashion

537
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:11,029
in this file we know that's one two

538
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:14,779
three four in the gesture you have to do

539
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:17,499
this gesture and you just have to switch

540
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:20,149
it on like with this Android backup it

541
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:21,950
doesn't work in all telephones of course

542
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:28,939
very specific androids

543
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:33,200
but well this is a trick and that's good

544
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:37,129
for your job one word of warning this is

545
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:40,149
very important the aim of this workshop

546
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:42,340
is not to teach you how to unblock

547
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:45,168
unblock mobile phones

548
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,289
the idea is to carry out a forensic

549
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:50,809
analysis of reports up the way you

550
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:52,429
unblock your mobile phone do you do does

551
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:54,879
you want and all the information that

552
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:58,490
I'm gonna tell you from now onwards is

553
00:29:54,879 --> 00:30:02,678
information that I've actually achieved

554
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:04,960
just by tinkering at home it's not

555
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:06,980
information that I've taken from any

556
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,100
corporation it's not reserved

557
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:12,259
information anybody it can find it you

558
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:16,269
can if you spend a lot of time analyzing

559
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:19,309
database or phones I don't want anybody

560
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:21,529
to think that I am going to tell you

561
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:24,470
something that's reserved to my work you

562
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:27,320
could discover this information if you

563
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:30,110
spent enough time doing this of course

564
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,950
if you're going to extract from a mobile

565
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:36,258
phone the owner and user of this smart

566
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:37,850
phone has authorized it and saying use

567
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:41,119
it because it's not the same as being

568
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:43,969
the owner of a phone and a user or the

569
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:47,029
information they use is the person that

570
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:52,610
owns its content of the owner it's the

571
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:55,610
person that bought it you know if I buy

572
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:58,639
a phone for my wife then she's the user

573
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:00,740
the user earns the information even

574
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:03,169
though I can be the owner of the phone

575
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:06,110
it's very important

576
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:08,690
or other why some kind of legal

577
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:10,699
authorization it's only a church that

578
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,190
can authorize you to get an infant

579
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,850
information from a telephone a judge or

580
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:19,810
a user otherwise you could to be

581
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:22,429
committing a crime a crime of secret

582
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:25,460
revealing secrets anyway how do we

583
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:28,490
connect to the mobile phone well you

584
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:32,390
have to extract the information from the

585
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:35,390
phone what an attack would I say attack

586
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:37,790
I mean connect and remove I'm not to

587
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:42,100
violate how can we get information from

588
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:48,680
our mobile phone or first you go to

589
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:53,889
typical a BB if nobody's you if you've

590
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:58,010
not used ADB in your Android you go into

591
00:31:53,890 --> 00:32:00,530
settings and now there's always one

592
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:04,610
about about phone so you go to build

593
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:08,560
number and you click on it seven times

594
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:11,120
or a few times and there you'll get

595
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:14,270
let's say you are now a developer an

596
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:20,270
Android developer so you know a

597
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:24,139
developer you click on developer and you

598
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:27,710
look at debug USB debug and here you can

599
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:32,590
actually access access but the first

600
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:39,410
time you connect you need to confirm the

601
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:44,300
D unblocking key some people say that

602
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:45,980
they've unlocked and key well they

603
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,669
didn't say yes at first they had to

604
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:51,770
connect to D block and to accept the

605
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:58,490
connection key if you don't accept the

606
00:32:51,770 --> 00:33:01,600
connection key you need to accept one

607
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:04,460
day to accept this you have to have

608
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,770
unblocked your mobile if not you can't

609
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:10,190
and you can't accept the information

610
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:11,620
from the phone so let's start the first

611
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,650
a demo it's easy

612
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:18,280
I just want you to see what it's like to

613
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:21,960
connect via ADB to your device hey I've

614
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:25,389
got this device which is my lab phone

615
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,130
you could do this with virtual machines

616
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,590
but I prefer to do it with a real

617
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,940
telephone because actually the

618
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,139
informations in the telephone it's not

619
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:42,190
in a virtual machine

620
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:43,510
I think we've connected it the way the

621
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:49,480
police have a way if you've never seen

622
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:50,679
ADB here it is can you see the text at

623
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,830
the back do you want me to make it

624
00:33:50,679 --> 00:34:00,010
bigger or can you see it okay if we

625
00:33:53,830 --> 00:34:01,510
right here it says that this device is

626
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:04,030
connected if you look at the bottom

627
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:07,390
there it's right at the bottom I don't

628
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:12,219
if you can see it but here right at the

629
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:14,889
top what's in white is that the

630
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:17,649
telephone reference this is the Sony and

631
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:19,810
it says I'm connected how did do we

632
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:23,440
connect to the telephone telephone five

633
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:27,610
eighty to be easy so what happens we

634
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:31,960
open a remote console within the screen

635
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:33,550
their telephone is a normal screen but

636
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,490
we've carried out a remote connection

637
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,409
now what do we do we can browse I'm

638
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:41,649
gonna do this quickly because you've

639
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:45,639
probably all seen this so we can go to

640
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:51,069
CD that means change directory make a

641
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:56,560
list of thing that is CD of sim which is

642
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:59,490
where I've got photos see where the

643
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,490
photos are in Android

644
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,520
and here we can see there there's a

645
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:15,509
photo there we we want to download that

646
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:26,690
photo so we leave here so we write a DP

647
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:26,690
pool Reuter SD card D sim

648
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:42,080
sim Andrew are the simple DSC 0-0

649
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:53,330
there is there's a one-point jpg we copy

650
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:57,470
to route well there it is it's

651
00:35:53,330 --> 00:36:02,930
downloading there you can see it and

652
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:06,740
it's downloaded the photo to the machine

653
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:11,480
that I've got here there it is it's a

654
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:16,419
photo of my workstation so I've just

655
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:18,950
downloaded it from the phone via a TB so

656
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,530
instead of downloading a photo let's

657
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:27,439
download the whatsapp conversation why

658
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:32,780
not we go to CD data then CD data again

659
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,430
you LS and then it says denied why why

660
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,910
can we not do it because we're not Ruth

661
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:41,149
in the phone so we can't get the

662
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:45,740
information and luckily this phone is

663
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:50,570
rooted so let's see what problems crop

664
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:56,299
up even if it's rooted now we can enter

665
00:36:50,570 --> 00:37:01,550
into what's up and go to databases and

666
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:04,340
there what everything what everybody

667
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:06,170
wants that's the database I've

668
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,700
highlighted it the most important

669
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,240
database in what's up but let's download

670
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,310
it

671
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:15,919
let's if we've got it let's download it

672
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:24,670
why not adp pool again

673
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:24,670
data data comm dot what's up databases

674
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:39,650
msg store dot DB am i going to copy it

675
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:44,259
to route dot DB it tells us no we don't

676
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:46,730
have the permit copied if you look into

677
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,840
internet there are manuals that say yes

678
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,840
you can do this remotely

679
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:59,200
so what'd you see an Internet

680
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:01,750
they do it in lab environments and they

681
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,049
see that's a rooted mobile so we've got

682
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:07,210
the database they're a we can play

683
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,070
around with it but we can't extract it

684
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:12,369
so maybe we can just copy it let's

685
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:17,760
create a DB shell we go to the database

686
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:17,760
again dot what's up

687
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:34,310
ft databases and with the CP command of

688
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:43,160
Linux a typical Linux command we just

689
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:46,130
copy it and we copy it here SD card so

690
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:50,020
that's a place we can access we'll just

691
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:52,670
copy it to SD card and I'll say no

692
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:55,400
because there's no there that isn't in

693
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:58,250
the shell so we've got the database I

694
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:02,540
can see it if you look I can see it if I

695
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:06,350
put cat MSG there it is that's the

696
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:09,860
database I can open it with cat so if I

697
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:16,009
can open it with cat I can add it to

698
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:22,280
another file if I open a cat msg store I

699
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:25,250
open and then I add it on another file

700
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,820
it's on the SD card to the part that I

701
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,820
can see

702
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:57,579
and there it is it's now a joint

703
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,578
I've stringed it

704
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,950
80 people

705
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:21,920
SD card this might seem something minor

706
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:27,920
but actually what you're doing is you're

707
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:33,100
downloading a what's up database and we

708
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,100
can copy it I'm going to abbreviate it

709
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:38,140
that's hopefully I won't get it wrong

710
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:53,619
okay I copied it now Welney I've got a

711
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:59,269
database from what's up that I've

712
00:40:53,619 --> 00:41:00,349
obtained via ADP and it just goes to

713
00:40:59,269 --> 00:41:02,419
show that there's some things that you

714
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:06,469
can't do but you can open it quite

715
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:10,069
easily look there it is that's just to

716
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:16,819
explain the basics to you another way

717
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:21,650
you can do it is via a manager you can

718
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:26,449
get a file manager a file explorer which

719
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:28,999
allows you to copy and paste you've got

720
00:41:26,449 --> 00:41:33,680
a root browser if you haven't got it

721
00:41:28,999 --> 00:41:35,328
installed you can install it you go to

722
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:40,848
the file with what's up and I've marked

723
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:46,910
it - there it is I copy it copy the

724
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:51,640
whole what's up file and we paste it on

725
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:54,259
the SD card and that's it end of story

726
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:58,910
you don't need a console you do you

727
00:41:54,259 --> 00:42:02,209
don't need to move ahead but there is

728
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:04,640
another way a mother a weird way of

729
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:06,919
things why can't we get the MSG store

730
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:14,299
from the database because I don't know

731
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:19,309
the users password and I can't download

732
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:27,969
it through a deep P but what I can do is

733
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:32,589
change the file password so if I go into

734
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:32,589
once again I can

735
00:42:44,460 --> 00:43:00,570
well with it I can do a CH mmm and then

736
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,570
I can add it to the key file

737
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:18,660
can you see it what I've done so I've

738
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:23,430
lost the pointer what's happened to if

739
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:31,049
you look all the other files that are in

740
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:33,660
the whatsup are ones that only the

741
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:35,910
owners can get in these are the permits

742
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,580
of the different files but this one here

743
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:41,190
look at all of this I can enter into

744
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:44,430
this one easily without being roots

745
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:51,540
because I've changed the user permits

746
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:54,810
and I can download them easily those of

747
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:57,050
you who are true forensics you know that

748
00:43:54,810 --> 00:44:02,400
it shouldn't be done and if you do it

749
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:03,630
you have to expend what you're doing

750
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,840
because you're changing what's in the

751
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:08,160
phone and when we finish what you need

752
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:12,390
to do is to leave things as they were

753
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:16,649
before or we add six the permit was at

754
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:19,980
600 which is default permit and there

755
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:22,890
you can see this that it goes back to

756
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:28,140
have the same that it had before this is

757
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:31,620
the last resource so what I'm saying

758
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:35,940
without a great deal of problems we can

759
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:37,460
get the mg store and also passports from

760
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:43,410
what so which is what we might be

761
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:46,130
interested in let's move on to exercise

762
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,129
five now

763
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:56,650
if you search internet to do this you

764
00:44:52,660 --> 00:45:00,100
can do it through DB backup what it

765
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:02,890
allows to do is DB backup is to do an

766
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:05,770
application backup it's actually in my

767
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:09,160
case never work the DB backup never

768
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:11,710
worked it is just the command is ADB

769
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:15,370
backup and never worked for what's up it

770
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:17,770
works for other apps but the way what's

771
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:22,120
up works meant that this actually didn't

772
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:27,630
work so we say where we want the what's

773
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,630
up act file to be extracted to

774
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:42,920
we need to say which application we want

775
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,920
to be extracted and it'll tell

776
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:54,680
it's not working it doesn't let me

777
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,970
extract the database from what's up in

778
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,230
this way and I'm saying that because

779
00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:04,279
there are other applications that you

780
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:06,560
can do that but we can do it in a

781
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:12,350
different way and we can easily

782
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:14,259
manipulate the database and there's

783
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:19,759
another

784
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:31,070
fashionable thing which is to download

785
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:33,290
the what's up version the 411 431 it's

786
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:35,660
allowed you to downgrade your what's up

787
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:38,060
for example I've got the 4 in my mobile

788
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:41,990
and it doesn't allow me to extract

789
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:44,380
database but I can I can fool the

790
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:46,910
telephone and say that I'm going to

791
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:51,040
upgrade my what's up but actually what I

792
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:55,120
do is downgrade it it's an oldish

793
00:46:51,040 --> 00:47:00,140
version and this one allows you to

794
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:03,049
create database backup it's only in this

795
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:06,650
version so what we do say Oh update

796
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:10,310
what's up we what we do is we then

797
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:12,680
change it and put this old

798
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:14,390
what's up version which is a older

799
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,419
version but it assigned what's up says

800
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:19,850
nobody's gonna say to us it's not signed

801
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:25,010
no it's a real what subversion so that

802
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:26,839
will allow us to extract I normally do

803
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:31,100
this in lineups with a series of

804
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:35,510
commands and that's it but with this

805
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:37,100
telephone doesn't work with line ups

806
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:41,660
have to do it with the windows with

807
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:43,400
PowerShell I don't have a virtual

808
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:46,370
machine with PowerShell here but it's

809
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:51,140
easy you can do it with a script with a

810
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:53,630
github or hit up sorry and we run it in

811
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,000
PowerShell and automatically it

812
00:47:53,630 --> 00:48:02,500
downloads the whatsup database there's

813
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,500
an article to explain how to do this

814
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:09,890
this is the video that explains how to

815
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,890
do it

816
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:25,519
I'm gonna put benny hill version up

817
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:30,260
which is that fast version here you can

818
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:33,348
see the telephones connected you run the

819
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:35,420
command or you got to do run script via

820
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:37,309
powershell it's doing the backup in case

821
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:41,210
anything goes wrong

822
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:43,880
it installs these previous version of

823
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:47,779
what's up the two eleven four three one

824
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:49,910
once it's installed it you can see the

825
00:48:47,779 --> 00:48:53,150
phone is saying to you do you want to

826
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:55,339
make a complete a security copy the app

827
00:48:53,150 --> 00:49:00,170
says asks you that you say yes yes i'll

828
00:48:55,339 --> 00:49:03,650
have that and then you carry on so the

829
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:07,549
telephone is just downloading this copy

830
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:08,930
into the computer and it'll open it said

831
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:10,940
that we can see it quite easy without

832
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:16,160
even having to hack it we can just move

833
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:21,940
it i i write down and it's an elegant

834
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:23,868
app which once again gives you the the

835
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:26,599
most updated

836
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:28,190
what's up version that you had before it

837
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:31,150
does that automatically you finish then

838
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:35,319
you go to this file and you can see

839
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:38,690
we've extracted the database there it is

840
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:40,220
and there's more than one database like

841
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:43,519
explain the other one later and you

842
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:45,430
don't need to be Ruth on on the

843
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:49,519
telephone any telephone that you've got

844
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:54,589
can do and it it's just a matter of

845
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:57,680
installing and old what's up version if

846
00:49:54,589 --> 00:50:01,099
you want to know where to find this old

847
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,769
version of what's up the CD and for

848
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:05,150
what's up gives you all the versions of

849
00:50:03,769 --> 00:50:08,149
what's up Atticus says so far and you

850
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:10,160
can download them but in and road seven

851
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:15,519
new but this doesn't work I don't know

852
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:19,640
why but it doesn't work and if what some

853
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:21,529
application is installed from the

854
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,868
factory so you you can buy a phone that

855
00:50:21,529 --> 00:50:26,000
swords got already go - what's up

856
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:30,480
installed when you if it's already got

857
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:32,940
what's I've installed in it won't work

858
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,010
so these are little avenues that you

859
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:39,740
need to research you to look into to

860
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:42,599
read to obtain what you want of course I

861
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:45,479
actually give this talk so that anybody

862
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:50,510
can do what I'm doing without spending a

863
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:57,270
lot of money but I'm talking about

864
00:50:50,510 --> 00:51:03,740
professional methods to extract this is

865
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:06,960
an effete actually what this is is a a

866
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:09,598
recorder mobile phone recorder and what

867
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:14,630
it'll do is it extract everything from a

868
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,630
mobile phone that you ask it to

869
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:31,420
if you've never seen how what these CD

870
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:33,730
bit reports look like this is what the

871
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,990
machine gives us when we connect and the

872
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:38,290
telephone to this kind of a machine

873
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:42,129
that's what the machine shows you it

874
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:47,920
goes to the data file here we've got all

875
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:51,430
the apps every single one of them we got

876
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,530
whatsup databases all of them it's easy

877
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:55,660
what's advantage of these kind of tools

878
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:57,250
it you don't need to be complicated we

879
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,779
need to know anything we just need to

880
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:01,869
find the next button on the screen

881
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,520
that's all the next next next just go to

882
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:07,650
next and then you can get all the

883
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:10,990
databases they're not encrypted

884
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:13,839
sometimes people say oh you know what's

885
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:17,379
up encrypts its database no it doesn't

886
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:23,170
do that it encrypts the database backup

887
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:28,750
only in Android and it makes a great

888
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:33,210
report that's number seven I think and

889
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:33,210
you can see it in PDF format

890
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:44,470
that's the report that this device gives

891
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:47,230
you it's a report that any other tool

892
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:50,220
could give you I just said that you know

893
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:53,800
that it exists and it's there the idea

894
00:52:50,220 --> 00:53:01,660
was to talk about commercial software at

895
00:52:53,800 --> 00:53:04,839
all so now that we've extracted the

896
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:07,720
files so at least we know how more or

897
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:12,820
less to extract them let's look at

898
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:18,879
what's important the most important file

899
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:20,859
is mg store MSG store DB there are

900
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,270
others we can look at but what we want

901
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:25,299
to see is where the kinds of

902
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:31,000
conversations are and the conversations

903
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:35,890
in what what's up as stored in SQLite

904
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:38,410
and they keep that information in an

905
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:45,040
understandable format and this is how an

906
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:46,930
ssq light works it's actually sometimes

907
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,910
a little bit difficult to understand

908
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,649
you've just got a series of numbers and

909
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,299
a little bit of information it's

910
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:56,050
different difficult to understand and

911
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:58,680
explain so let's open it so you can see

912
00:53:56,050 --> 00:53:58,680
what it looks like

913
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:21,799
and here we've got a database we don't

914
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:25,059
know if it's a whatsapp one if it's a

915
00:54:21,799 --> 00:54:28,099
database it doesn't have an add-on even

916
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:36,130
for example in Linux says such as in the

917
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:41,809
file command tells us what this is we

918
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:45,829
drag it over and I'm gonna know if I

919
00:54:41,809 --> 00:54:49,849
write it there you go and it says that's

920
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:52,609
an SQLite version 3000 without knowing

921
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:56,089
what sort of file it is it just as an

922
00:54:52,609 --> 00:55:01,130
SQLite so now we know how this database

923
00:54:56,089 --> 00:55:05,240
how to operate with this database if we

924
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:07,839
open it you can actually see more

925
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,839
information

926
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:26,808
and this is the same thing that I

927
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:29,959
explained to you earlier but it's opened

928
00:55:26,809 --> 00:55:31,759
at SQLite that's what a database of

929
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:33,109
what's up database looks like and when

930
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:34,489
you look at it like that you think well

931
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:36,469
hey you know what does that mean

932
00:55:34,489 --> 00:55:42,649
I'll explain to you what do you mean at

933
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:46,249
the top these 16 offsets give give us

934
00:55:42,649 --> 00:55:50,868
the security aversion this is what does

935
00:55:46,249 --> 00:55:53,839
is an SQLite and here and the remaining

936
00:55:50,869 --> 00:56:01,399
offsets is why we get the information

937
00:55:53,839 --> 00:56:03,078
from a database here what I'm trying to

938
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:09,788
do is to explain you something that you

939
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:13,459
can comprehend but look this is this

940
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:15,529
computer design this is the same as we

941
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:17,569
saw before what I've just done is

942
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:20,139
highlight it so you can understand it in

943
00:56:17,569 --> 00:56:23,538
yellow at the top that's the heading of

944
00:56:20,139 --> 00:56:26,989
the file in this decimal you've got all

945
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:32,119
that information if we convert it to a C

946
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:34,099
it'll just put sqlite format 3,300 so

947
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:43,549
that's what the first row is for so

948
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:48,109
forget about that offset 17 this is of

949
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:51,649
16 + 2 17 what it tells you is the size

950
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:57,019
of the page invites here it says a hex

951
00:56:51,649 --> 00:57:00,739
of a thousand we know it's a 496 that's

952
00:56:57,019 --> 00:57:03,738
the space that's left if we want to know

953
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:10,339
how much each page occupies you go to

954
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:14,449
the conversion it says 4096 and and here

955
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:16,749
it says the validity of option 1 is no 1

956
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:16,749
2

957
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:26,579
so we've got the reading and the writing

958
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:28,099
wall option the change numbers the

959
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:34,440
database there it is

960
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:37,069
122 122 but 290 if you put in decimal

961
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:40,799
what it means it's the number of times a

962
00:57:37,069 --> 00:57:42,329
database has been modified so if

963
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,910
somebody says they've said something

964
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:48,119
when that she didn't say it you can

965
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:51,538
actually manipulate the database then

966
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:54,170
what's up database but don't forget that

967
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:56,759
the information is kept in many other

968
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:58,049
places and if we start to inject some

969
00:57:56,759 --> 00:57:59,729
conversations that didn't exist and if

970
00:57:58,049 --> 00:58:00,960
this data didn't meet the other data

971
00:57:59,729 --> 00:58:05,519
then we've got the proof that this

972
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:10,049
database has been tampered with because

973
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:15,508
you can tamper with database but traces

974
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:18,180
are left in this add-on there's lots of

975
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:20,489
them here this is just one of them this

976
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:24,328
is the number of times that's been

977
00:58:20,489 --> 00:58:27,569
updated number of pages if at the top it

978
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:31,140
gives just the say size of each page and

979
00:58:27,569 --> 00:58:35,099
here we've got the number of pages 53 if

980
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:38,129
we multiply 83 by each page we've got

981
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:39,630
the size of the database if you look at

982
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:52,609
the size of the database it's in there

983
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:55,469
and finally the BD code utf-8 utf-16 in

984
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:57,029
it's just so that you can understand at

985
00:58:55,469 --> 00:59:00,210
a low level this database

986
00:58:57,029 --> 00:59:03,089
operates but I'm not going to work on it

987
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:06,210
no I'm not going to work on these

988
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:10,799
applications if you want to know more

989
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:13,469
about how database works there's an

990
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:16,249
article here about SQLite which

991
00:59:13,469 --> 00:59:21,239
explained in just three or four articles

992
00:59:16,249 --> 00:59:24,629
how a database works and this tells you

993
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:29,490
how SQLite works okay let's

994
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:31,350
start now analyzing the databases and

995
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:33,479
logs that we get in whatsapp and we

996
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:37,860
start out with the most important which

997
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:40,640
is mg a store DB I'm gonna start about

998
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:44,310
the most talking about the most recent

999
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:48,270
version of words ups by the way I've had

1000
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:51,390
to change my talk four times because

1001
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:53,790
there's been for updates to what's up

1002
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:56,819
and if it to update this talk so that

1003
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:59,910
it's updated to today I'm gonna tell you

1004
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:01,920
about now what what's up looks like okay

1005
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:05,310
it might not look like this tomorrow if

1006
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:11,100
they update it but let's now look with

1007
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:17,460
at class number nine class number ten we

1008
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:22,740
open the mgs store database let's start

1009
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:31,200
cut this database off with MSG store dot

1010
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:33,479
DB this is the word SAP database this is

1011
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,960
the series of tables in that database

1012
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:39,600
there's a lot these are tables places

1013
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,640
where information is stored in what's up

1014
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:45,299
let's start with the first one chat list

1015
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:47,640
checklist is a copy of the conversations

1016
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:50,970
that the person has had so the place

1017
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:53,490
where the conversations are saved but we

1018
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:55,200
can find this in the conversation table

1019
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:58,169
if anybody is manipulating on the other

1020
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:59,970
side there is a trace that it this isn't

1021
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:01,830
the version it's not compatible with the

1022
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:04,680
other one somebody has tampered the

1023
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:09,600
database it's the only sense of having

1024
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:12,600
this specific table the checklist it's

1025
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:16,980
not really interesting frequents the

1026
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:20,069
frequents it's interesting when you use

1027
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:23,040
what's up you have the favorites or your

1028
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:25,020
favorite charts or more interesting

1029
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,750
people for you these are saved here this

1030
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:32,460
is kept here and says the number of

1031
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:34,590
messages 21 message count number of

1032
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:37,260
messages that we have exchanged with

1033
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:38,200
that person you know the person who's

1034
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,690
always sending

1035
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:48,970
stupid videos well it's the highest

1036
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:51,160
ranking ranked in the message count I'll

1037
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,990
explain this in the other database about

1038
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:57,220
the hits now we'll have group of

1039
01:01:52,990 --> 01:02:00,910
participants another table all the

1040
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:04,660
groups that we have in whatsapp friends

1041
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:09,339
work etc are here it's listed here on

1042
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:14,200
top in the hint what we keep is the date

1043
01:02:09,339 --> 01:02:16,720
it's the epoch time 1 1 1970 and the

1044
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:20,618
number the phone number of the creator

1045
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:22,930
of the group three times the phone

1046
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:26,470
number of the group creator because in

1047
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:28,060
that group there's three people these

1048
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:30,220
are the three people in the group where

1049
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:32,740
this is the phone and this phone in this

1050
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:34,750
phone number this group we have these

1051
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:39,660
three people with these three phone

1052
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:43,270
numbers this is a very small database

1053
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:44,890
it's easy to interpret if you open your

1054
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:46,839
database this could be infinite because

1055
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:49,118
each participant in each group is going

1056
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:51,759
to appear here if the same participant

1057
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:57,040
is in one in more than one group this is

1058
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:59,560
going to be more complex so in a real

1059
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:02,250
production of a real what's up this list

1060
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:04,810
would be very long this is the broadcast

1061
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:07,839
messages they're not very much used

1062
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:13,839
what's up but for this example sends the

1063
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:16,210
same message to different people so it's

1064
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:18,400
not spam and it's done with broadcasted

1065
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:21,369
this person is not going to your contact

1066
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,740
list and sending it just to you he sends

1067
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:25,750
it to all the the the contacts this is

1068
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:29,649
the epic date and the person to which

1069
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:32,050
this has been sent this device one at

1070
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:35,560
this date this data is sent in a message

1071
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:42,960
to one just a single message to these

1072
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:42,960
people but these two people okay next is

1073
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:49,750
this is most important table of the most

1074
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:55,520
important database the messages table

1075
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:58,790
the MSA MSG stored database let's start

1076
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,310
with the first one ID it is the sequence

1077
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:02,720
sequence number of each conversation

1078
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:06,320
every time I receive a whatsapp message

1079
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:08,598
a photo a video any type of stupid thing

1080
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,650
that I received through whatsup has an

1081
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:12,260
ID number

1082
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:15,920
it's a sequential order in the numbers

1083
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:18,440
it means that if I want to tamper the

1084
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:24,109
database because oh why insulted a

1085
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:26,540
person I'm going to erase it so that

1086
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:29,029
nobody sees it so I erase the

1087
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:41,500
conversation but the IDE tidy is still

1088
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:44,390
there if you see the ID is 7 8 9 10 11

1089
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:47,000
verse Asian that's missing the 11 is

1090
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:50,259
missing there should be a conversation

1091
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:55,220
there somebody has erased a conversation

1092
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:57,280
out of this whatsapp group we know that

1093
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:01,520
something has been eliminated because

1094
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:08,119
there's an ID missing so we know that's

1095
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:11,839
something happening there the data it's

1096
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:15,349
where we keep a what with sent hello how

1097
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:18,470
are you what we do tomorrow all the text

1098
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:21,770
that we sent through whatsapp is kept in

1099
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:25,069
the data table texts and URLs that we

1100
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:28,250
could have sent we send a URL through

1101
01:05:25,070 --> 01:05:33,760
whatsapp everything is kept in this

1102
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:33,760
column called data here there's no page

1103
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:41,210
for instance photo camera camera we

1104
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:44,930
could have sent a link to an euro URL

1105
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:47,859
that would appear the data column can

1106
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:47,859
you remote hit

1107
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:58,868
here we see you who is the person with

1108
01:05:55,510 --> 01:06:01,420
which with whom you were talking to Jews

1109
01:05:58,869 --> 01:06:05,260
means group this is a conversation in a

1110
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:07,119
group what's shown here is group it's

1111
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:09,369
whatsapp dotnet it's a conversation

1112
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:12,580
between two to two between two people

1113
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:16,950
not a group oh it's easy

1114
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:19,810
well that wasn't easy I had to find it

1115
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:22,390
you can't reach conclusions with just

1116
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:25,330
looking at this now you see it's oh if

1117
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:27,819
it's Gigi's group of course it's not

1118
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:32,799
documented so we had to find it a phone

1119
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:34,390
number and the epoch date so the time if

1120
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,070
you don't know what is the a pocket

1121
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:39,460
eight it's stupid well it doesn't matter

1122
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:43,780
the seconds that have gone through since

1123
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:45,520
the first January 1970 1970 there's a

1124
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:49,119
Linux command that the command that

1125
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:51,880
tells you the time this conversation was

1126
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:55,030
created the 18th of November at 11 of

1127
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:59,640
three minutes in the morning this number

1128
01:06:55,030 --> 01:07:01,990
is transformed into a date that we know

1129
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,799
so that's the date when this message has

1130
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:10,149
been sent

1131
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:14,830
next yes I noted this down you are real

1132
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:17,710
hackers if you want to start put these

1133
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:21,279
phone numbers on and to activate those

1134
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:25,290
numbers these are manipulated no single

1135
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:28,660
phone number is real these no not real

1136
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:29,770
numbers no no you you can't send a

1137
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:36,910
message because that phone number

1138
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:38,740
doesn't exist that would a personís well

1139
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:41,500
I suppose this is a phone number but we

1140
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:44,470
don't know who's the owner so the

1141
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:46,960
database is cleaned this is just done

1142
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:48,759
with a query against the database

1143
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:53,790
everything that corresponds to the real

1144
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:56,080
number my number has to be converted and

1145
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:59,080
turned into another number all the

1146
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:00,670
databases are cleaned so we don't start

1147
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:03,009
using this phone numbers because they

1148
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:07,320
don't exist

1149
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:12,820
so first time it happens so before

1150
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:16,900
before a catastrophe huh appears well

1151
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:19,690
get for me the key remote hit doesn't

1152
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:22,479
tell us this person has sent the message

1153
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:24,870
or if it has received it the sent and

1154
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:28,080
the received message the kid from me

1155
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:31,839
this one tells us the truth

1156
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:35,670
0:01 it said when this one means that an

1157
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:40,420
out out coming a message and zero is an

1158
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:43,750
incoming message so here one one of the

1159
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:46,839
list it's out coming message the message

1160
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:53,729
has been sent to this person it doesn't

1161
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:57,818
say anything but we'll see why yeah

1162
01:08:53,729 --> 01:09:02,019
there's another table okay the AED key

1163
01:08:57,819 --> 01:09:04,660
ID so we have an idea of what we are

1164
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:09,310
sending I don't even know what these

1165
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:15,130
numbers mean but I'm not interested some

1166
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:18,850
of them start with call cool so in K key

1167
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:22,600
ID when it starts with call it means

1168
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:27,069
it's a video call or of a whatsapp voice

1169
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:30,910
call or with IP voice if it starts with

1170
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:36,069
cold means that this number has received

1171
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:39,160
a call from the other number from the

1172
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:42,640
other destination phone phone number so

1173
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:45,009
we know at that time all this

1174
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:49,210
information is there and little by

1175
01:09:45,009 --> 01:09:53,229
little we are going to discover what it

1176
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:54,940
conceals and the forensic tools are very

1177
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:56,440
expensive and they don't know how to

1178
01:09:54,940 --> 01:10:00,280
interpret because they don't know what

1179
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:02,889
these numbers mean so we can't really

1180
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:10,679
decipher that there was a have this

1181
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:15,400
other field status status in is

1182
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:17,140
the moment in the message double blue

1183
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:19,660
double check for instance if it's zero

1184
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:23,170
its received in the device just received

1185
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:25,210
if it's for waiting for the server you

1186
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:28,450
send a message you have no reception its

1187
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:33,100
mode for so waiting for for the coverage

1188
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:36,370
five it's it's received in the device

1189
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:39,880
but the user hasn't open it it's the

1190
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:44,140
gray double check the blue double check

1191
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:45,510
is number five I think or six I don't

1192
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:49,600
remember

1193
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:52,600
five or six that that message is a

1194
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:56,350
control message so we know if the

1195
01:10:52,600 --> 01:11:02,530
messages that this has correctly been

1196
01:10:56,350 --> 01:11:06,040
received in the in the phone when the

1197
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:12,179
status shows 13 I don't know what 13

1198
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:16,200
means if you know it please tell me

1199
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:19,030
these are just checking check check

1200
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:20,230
checks that are made in the database

1201
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:22,120
here we don't know where this figure

1202
01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:27,219
this number what I don't know what it

1203
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:29,740
means that time stand is the moment in

1204
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:30,220
which the moment the message has been

1205
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:35,380
sent

1206
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:37,630
again this is the epic format sent a

1207
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:40,030
message you can manipulate it but this

1208
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:40,870
you can't manipulate and we see what has

1209
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:45,540
happened really

1210
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:45,540
we don't have media URL

1211
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:53,400
it in fact we think it is a sent URLs

1212
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:57,570
but it's not the case when we send a

1213
01:11:53,400 --> 01:12:02,489
photo we send a URL to your destination

1214
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:06,989
so this is the web database this is the

1215
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:09,000
URL pointing to the file in your whites

1216
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,019
observer when we send a picture we

1217
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,940
upload

1218
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:14,790
- what's observer and what's up sends it

1219
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:18,089
to another person so this is a photo you

1220
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:20,790
sent and this is the encryption and you

1221
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:26,160
can download it then we have media what

1222
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:29,190
type here media what type so it's

1223
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:30,469
telling us what has been sent it's quite

1224
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:34,259
important zero

1225
01:12:30,469 --> 01:12:39,060
well it's zero here it means it's just

1226
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:48,690
sent text hello how are you or URL text

1227
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:53,910
if it's one one is a picture has been

1228
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:56,129
sent one a photo a picture photos taken

1229
01:12:53,910 --> 01:13:01,349
with your mobile phone or photos in your

1230
01:12:56,130 --> 01:13:05,640
gallery - is an audio message instead of

1231
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:07,320
writing people send or audio messages

1232
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:12,630
that lasts for 40 minutes three is a

1233
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:16,650
video recorded from your camera and four

1234
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:18,810
is the contact card people are asking

1235
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:20,610
for a contact and you go to your agenda

1236
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:22,010
and you send a contact what's the

1237
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:24,540
problem

1238
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:27,780
well you send the contact but you don't

1239
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:29,429
just send the number you send the name

1240
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:32,699
that you have allocated before that

1241
01:13:29,429 --> 01:13:35,460
person in your agenda please don't I'll

1242
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:37,678
send the contact of your boss and you

1243
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:39,750
have a horrible name for your boss this

1244
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:42,360
person has will see the contact name

1245
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:46,530
that you've selected for your boss so be

1246
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:52,019
careful so the contact card be careful

1247
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:54,480
of that 5 is geo-positioning I send the

1248
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:56,520
position to another person so we don't

1249
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:59,370
know where is the place and I send my

1250
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:04,580
position to the another person

1251
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:10,080
the field five will appear eight again

1252
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:14,340
IP voice IP call call and it was on with

1253
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:16,650
number to call to weaken manipulators or

1254
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:18,930
modify the database we don't modified it

1255
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:22,349
here you have the proof and the evidence

1256
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:24,270
that the database eight with IP voice

1257
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:26,030
call has been modified and the last

1258
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:29,840
number sixteen

1259
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:33,179
it's a couple of weeks since it started

1260
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:35,970
we can't interpret sixteen is a new

1261
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:38,730
what's up option then allows you to

1262
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:42,390
share the location for fifteen minutes

1263
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:44,519
for five hours or eight hours I'm say

1264
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:46,920
sending my location for fifteen minutes

1265
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,680
up to eight hours to the other person

1266
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,480
the other person on a map sees how I'm

1267
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:54,660
moving around there's a new

1268
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:57,990
functionality this is not kept us link

1269
01:14:54,660 --> 01:15:00,269
five but as 16 if we see a sixteen the

1270
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:02,540
means that this person has shared this

1271
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:06,380
he's over location with another person

1272
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:10,110
let's say the time media duration

1273
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:14,070
everything is in English in English so

1274
01:15:10,110 --> 01:15:16,920
media duration column the seconds June

1275
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:20,280
which the person has shared his or her

1276
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:22,920
location so sixteen and then here the

1277
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:25,860
number of seconds I've been sharing this

1278
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:30,780
my position with another person during

1279
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:34,670
this time then here eleven seconds I'm

1280
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:39,509
sharing you my location for 11 seconds

1281
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:42,840
media name the name of what we are

1282
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:46,800
sending if we send a photo there's a

1283
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:50,760
name attached to that photo so it will

1284
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:52,590
appear here here well it's a video here

1285
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:57,180
this is the name of the picture that we

1286
01:15:52,590 --> 01:16:00,300
sent the real name so we sent a video

1287
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:03,240
this is the video name and here the name

1288
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:06,000
of the location when we send a location

1289
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:08,730
through whatsapp we're giving the court

1290
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,130
GPS coordinates port through Google Maps

1291
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:12,070
it shows us while the name of the

1292
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:15,690
streets

1293
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:19,150
of the city etc it's saved here jnjah

1294
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:23,259
Santander just an example the name of

1295
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:27,370
the location the GPS coordinates here is

1296
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:29,020
a precise point the GPS location we can

1297
01:16:27,370 --> 01:16:31,570
manipulate one but not the others and

1298
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:34,480
now we know whether people are so the

1299
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:37,120
GPS coordinates either if we send a

1300
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:42,849
unique position I'm here that's all or

1301
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:48,160
if we are sending positions in time so

1302
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:51,430
we have media hash this is it's

1303
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:53,680
fantastic for forensics science we time

1304
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:55,690
we send a picture a video not only you

1305
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:58,150
send it but it's hashed there's a

1306
01:16:55,690 --> 01:17:01,900
digital signature attached to that file

1307
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:07,809
I send a photo with little cats oh I was

1308
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:10,330
i received a photo a very and difficult

1309
01:17:07,810 --> 01:17:16,870
photo and you contains a calculates all

1310
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:20,380
the hashes with spaces for 64 with 256

1311
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:22,150
and it's coded in base for so you will

1312
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:32,520
see more information about the picture

1313
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:32,519
or the element that is sent LCP

1314
01:17:51,749 --> 01:18:01,409
here three columns the moment in which

1315
01:17:55,739 --> 01:18:03,299
this it's an epic there's nothing it's a

1316
01:18:01,409 --> 01:18:06,780
moment when the message got to the

1317
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:09,090
server the date on which this has

1318
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:13,139
reached a little device and they're

1319
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:16,619
reading date in the device everything is

1320
01:18:13,139 --> 01:18:18,840
not shown like in whatever we know when

1321
01:18:16,619 --> 01:18:20,610
the picture has got to the server when

1322
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,070
it's got to the destination device and

1323
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:29,159
when the person has seen it this is the

1324
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:34,049
epic date it's not parsed and another

1325
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:36,148
new novelty here edit version people in

1326
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:40,639
whatsapp have added a new functionality

1327
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:43,649
that allows us to delete a message

1328
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:47,879
remotely I send a message but I don't

1329
01:18:43,649 --> 01:18:51,260
want it and I press delete delete in my

1330
01:18:47,879 --> 01:18:54,179
phone but remotely there's a hack there

1331
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:56,969
do in the next seven minutes if I send

1332
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:59,099
you a message and I want to delete it in

1333
01:18:56,969 --> 01:19:02,639
eight minutes I cannot do it just

1334
01:18:59,099 --> 01:19:05,369
locally but during my first seven

1335
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:08,519
minutes I can delete it in the in the

1336
01:19:05,369 --> 01:19:10,409
server - if you have seven in edit

1337
01:19:08,519 --> 01:19:12,419
version it means that the user has

1338
01:19:10,409 --> 01:19:14,339
deleted that conversation knows only in

1339
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:16,769
his phone but for the rest of people

1340
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:20,309
that have received it if there's another

1341
01:19:16,769 --> 01:19:22,260
figure maybe it's deleted it but your

1342
01:19:20,309 --> 01:19:25,499
five is just in his phone

1343
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:28,260
it's an new functionalities and the last

1344
01:19:25,499 --> 01:19:32,369
version of whatsapp and now how to

1345
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:35,189
recover spice that have been deleted in

1346
01:19:32,369 --> 01:19:39,360
whatsapp we want to get this deleted

1347
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:41,280
files out of you the phone it's passing

1348
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,489
what's been deleted that's the basis to

1349
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,489
it

1350
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:57,030
what

1351
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:03,600
mr. SES Clippers

1352
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:18,640
estaba Seto's ki Ensenada para ganar

1353

Yali simplemente tell me what recipe

1354
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:23,830
okay this is another hip hop script SQL

1355
01:20:21,699 --> 01:20:29,259
parse and you can download it for free

1356
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:38,199
and you can extract deleted content from

1357
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:41,590
the database it's easy of course it

1358
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:46,030
doesn't say I'm deleted in blue well you

1359
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:49,360
have to look for that here mono mono do

1360
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:52,660
you remember the the number 11 the 11

1361
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:54,940
that was deleted yes it's a message sent

1362
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:57,940
to Mono and I wanted to delete it I

1363
01:20:54,940 --> 01:20:59,370
delete I've done the carving of the

1364
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:02,469
database and this message has been

1365
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:08,530
deleted they're armed phone numbers and

1366
01:21:02,469 --> 01:21:11,020
other deleted items we have to analyze

1367
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:16,259
it in careful but you seeing what's up

1368
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:16,260
you can delete and recover deleted files

1369
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:26,320
see what's up web quite recent

1370
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:29,349
functionalities in whatsapp let's open

1371
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:40,900
this database in the web sessions what's

1372
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:42,760
up web if you don't know how whatsapp

1373
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:45,160
web works in fact it's quite curious if

1374
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,590
you send a message it's not a computer

1375
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:49,300
that is sending the the computer is

1376
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:52,719
sending to the phone and the phone is

1377
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:54,910
sending to the contact to the service

1378
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:56,949
the telephone has always neat neat

1379
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:59,650
reception if you there's no coverage

1380
01:21:56,949 --> 01:22:02,710
your whatsapp web is not going to work

1381
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:04,900
we are QR 10th occasion we have the

1382
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:09,699
windows white submarines installs the

1383
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:12,489
what's up windows is like a browser it's

1384
01:22:09,699 --> 01:22:20,250
if the information is kept in a user app

1385
01:22:12,489 --> 01:22:20,250
data that's not really interesting

1386
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:29,930
the whatsapp web database we have the

1387
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:33,080
all the information so we have a the

1388
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:37,250
browser ad identifier here I don't

1389
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:43,640
really know what how to obtain it it's a

1390
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:45,560
hash base64 it's an AI unique ID single

1391
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,780
ID of the browser that we are using I

1392
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,700
don't really know how this is generated

1393
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:51,710
how this specific hash is generated I

1394
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:54,860
suppose it's an X file but I don't have

1395
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:59,180
it I didn't identify it here have the OS

1396
01:22:54,860 --> 01:23:00,469
stable the operating system so it's the

1397
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:02,750
operating system that the person is

1398
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:06,590
using to send the what's up Windows 7

1399
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:09,560
Linux or another one this is yoo

1400
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:14,440
byung-eon - and to know if a person has

1401
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:17,720
connected a prodigiously to my web

1402
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:20,750
whatsapp web so we know this is chrome

1403
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:24,440
and this is a Firefox browser and the

1404
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:26,200
latitude and the longitude the GPS it

1405
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:32,509
says to us here

1406
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:34,220
it's tell us the the session GPS but

1407
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:37,040
it's quite deceptive it's not the

1408
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:40,970
computer's GPS location it's the mobile

1409
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:43,430
phone GPS location for for us forensics

1410
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:47,240
we know where the user was but this is

1411
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:51,830
just the phone GPS the computer GPS it's

1412
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:54,380
15 meters and the place in Madrid it's

1413
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:56,480
it's the computer GPS location and the

1414
01:23:54,380 --> 01:24:00,680
last activities we know if this message

1415
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:03,830
has been sent and when was the last

1416
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:06,320
activity here when somebody has closed

1417
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:11,269
the session if you close the wats up web

1418
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:14,000
session so that it can it stops

1419
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:17,920
functioning but I left something here

1420
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:27,350
you will go to MC msg store dot DB

1421
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:29,910
messages yeah k and d key ID three three

1422
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:33,320
zero here

1423
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:36,630
these 3k ID numbers at the beginning

1424
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:41,070
well we have three that starts with

1425
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:43,110
three eb0 this is a unique pattern that

1426
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:44,969
whatsapp creates every time you send a

1427
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:46,830
message through watch this whatsapp web

1428
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:48,690
how do I know if as message has been

1429
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:51,180
sent through the normal what's up all

1430
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:53,190
through the whatsapp web we need to look

1431
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:55,320
for three b eb0

1432
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:56,940
this pattern in the database we know

1433
01:24:55,320 --> 01:25:00,000
that if this message has been sent

1434
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:01,019
through whatsapp web imagine the person

1435
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,110
has disappeared

1436
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:06,210
says she's sending messages insulting

1437
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:08,370
the other person my phone was on the

1438
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:11,220
table and I never touched it well we

1439
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:13,230
know now that the message has been sent

1440
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:16,590
through whatsapp web though thanks to

1441
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:19,889
the other table we know who or what

1442
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:25,260
computer has sent these messages through

1443
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:39,120
whatsapp web and that's interesting for

1444
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:42,570
us so whatsapp is saving traces of

1445
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:48,540
everything so if you try to tamper the

1446
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:56,250
database in fact you can't and you'll be

1447
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:58,590
identified anyway your functionality

1448
01:25:56,250 --> 01:26:02,040
lights up to share locations for a

1449
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:05,670
period of time it's called location dot

1450
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:08,670
TB that database is saved then phone

1451
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:14,330
number or so to which you send your

1452
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:17,160
location origin destination and expire

1453
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:19,050
it's not the moment in which it expires

1454
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:23,460
at the moment when you send it I don't

1455
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:26,250
know why this is the date in which

1456
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:28,910
you've sent it not the expiring date of

1457
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:31,680
your session and here a single you

1458
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:33,690
identifier or the message let's see the

1459
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:39,830
other table it's the same this it's the

1460
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:39,830
same ID then we have another database

1461
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:52,590
so lot weight it's fast but in fact you

1462
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:57,030
can see this slowly at home if you're

1463
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:58,710
interested you can see it with more

1464
01:26:57,030 --> 01:27:01,469
there's a lot of information I know it's

1465
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:02,760
too fast I would like to give you the

1466
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:04,650
information and to want to keep it for

1467
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,490
me but then you will have access to this

1468
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:10,559
presentation

1469
01:27:05,490 --> 01:27:14,179
the axilor database is the one that

1470
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:17,070
manages the point-to-point encryption

1471
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:20,910
it's not plain text it's a

1472
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:26,460
point-to-point this database is managing

1473
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:28,590
that it tells us the the single ID the

1474
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:31,350
telephone number the connection of this

1475
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:36,090
phone with whom and when through the

1476
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:38,340
double ratchet the encryption systems

1477
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:42,000
here tell us if anybody has talked with

1478
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:45,480
anybody if anybody the person has opened

1479
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:47,820
a window to speak with someone once we

1480
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:50,309
have this person well there's a message

1481
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:52,139
given by the watts of certificate and as

1482
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:54,000
soon as this appears means that this

1483
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:57,600
person has tried to speak with someone

1484
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:00,060
and this and we know with whom you've

1485
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,830
spoken we don't know what you've said

1486
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:04,920
but at least a person has spoken with

1487
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:09,990
another person or at least this person

1488
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:12,630
has tried this is 13 yes practice 13 if

1489
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:16,050
you really want to know how this

1490
01:28:12,630 --> 01:28:19,140
point-to-point encryption works not not

1491
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:22,380
how it's kept in your phone but Rowell

1492
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:25,650
since gave a presentation and explains

1493
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:27,750
in depth how this point-to-point

1494
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:30,000
encryption works in whatsapp growl

1495
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:33,660
sealless that's in communication this is

1496
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:37,350
not the storage part another database

1497
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:40,710
that I just love it is the emoji emoji

1498
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:43,560
dictionary all the emojis in whatsapp

1499
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:45,180
are caps it's a fantastic database the

1500
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:48,780
most important the one we have to

1501
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:53,660
extract emoji dictionary dot DB that's

1502
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:57,929
it and here we find all the emojis

1503
01:28:53,660 --> 01:29:04,440

01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:09,710
of the emoji let's look for pea emoji

1506
01:29:13,010 --> 01:29:20,570
now you can't really see the picture

1507
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,570
this is in symbols you can't see

1508

1512
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:23,950
- chorim just believe me there's another

1513
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:27,090
interesting thing about this the emoji

1514
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:30,690
dictionary let's look for the burger now

1515

1519
01:30:51,620 --> 01:31:01,340
a look at this and you'll find if we

1520
01:30:54,860 --> 01:31:05,660
convert this you'll see what you get is

1521
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:06,830
the a her a burger icon and you might

1522
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:07,519
think well why is he want to explain

1523
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:09,440
this to me

1524
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,350
I don't if you know it there's a slight

1525
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:16,969
difference between Apple and Android

1526
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:20,690
burgers apples put the cheese on top of

1527
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:23,300
the meat but androids put the cheese for

1528
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:25,790
the burger below the meat the meat

1529
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:29,290
patties so if you've got an iPhone this

1530
01:31:25,790 --> 01:31:31,580
is what you're fine with this burger

1531
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:34,100
what do you want the cheese on top of

1532
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:40,330
the cheese below the burger I mean it's

1533
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:45,040
stupid but hey but if you go now to data

1534
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:45,040
vending cachet I think it's this one

1535
01:31:47,950 --> 01:31:52,790
this is the most important Android

1536
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:55,099
directory it's where the emoticons and

1537
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:57,950
here you can see it this is the emoticon

1538
01:31:55,100 --> 01:32:01,840
this one this is a Mac one this is

1539
01:31:57,950 --> 01:32:04,910
emoticon which is in inside the

1540
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:06,620
telephone that I've analyzed so that how

1541
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:09,110
do we know if it's an Android or Mac

1542
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:15,290
what depends for the cheese's you can

1543
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:17,420
imagine writing reports saying how you

1544
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:19,250
know it's an Android phone because the

1545
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:29,420
cheese is blue that burger rather than

1546
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:31,090
above the burger we vary about 17

1547
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:33,140
minutes left so we gotta get on with it

1548
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:36,260
I'm internal never get this internet

1549
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:37,970
posting be tanka Farmington aranga give

1550
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:39,920
me some internet please just just give

1551
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:40,520
me some internet and then I'll treat

1552
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:43,600
your coffee

1553
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,600
give me some internet please

1554
01:32:57,370 --> 01:33:06,410
such settings for the selassie settings

1555
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:10,220
Islamic this is the database that

1556
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:13,250
manages the setup for each chart for if

1557
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:16,930
I've I can silence a person that keeps

1558
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:21,830
on sending me stuff all of this is

1559
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:24,410
managed by this whatsup database the hot

1560
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:29,690
idea is also the person's identify here

1561
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:32,780
you can see it's a group you can see

1562
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:37,639
it's a user a specific user and these

1563
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:40,070
are a set up for a specific group this

1564
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:42,530
is set up for a specific user and this

1565
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:46,190
is the set up a general set up for all

1566
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:49,730
users and this is a general set up for

1567
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:54,879
all groups and you can see that this is

1568
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:58,549
this guy's sick so of getting these

1569
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,960
videos and so I've silenced it until it

1570
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:03,740
gets to this date and then it will start

1571
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:08,810
knowing me again we've also got the

1572
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:12,559
content of the message here you can

1573
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:16,520
change the sound that the mobile phone

1574
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:17,560
makes this is the sound if we go there

1575
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:24,650
to this address

1576
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:27,640
it's a tone we can also manage if the

1577
01:34:24,650 --> 01:34:31,490
phone allows you to how much it vibrates

1578
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:34,340
it can either vibrate a lot or level-3

1579
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:37,450
it vibrates a lot level one less than

1580
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:41,120
the pop-up emerges and then the color

1581
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:43,490
because there are some phones where you

1582
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:47,680
can see it comes up in green or in white

1583
01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:50,809
that's where you control that FF white

1584
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:54,680
so if this person sends me a message the

1585
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:58,100
light will shine white and this is

1586
01:34:54,680 --> 01:35:01,700
managed by wassup via a database that's

1587
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:03,010
in the internal memory so is a lot of

1588
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,809
information there

1589
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:08,719
that you can get out from just a simple

1590
01:35:05,809 --> 01:35:10,249
app imagine this multiplies with all the

1591
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:12,440
other apps that we have in your mobile

1592
01:35:10,249 --> 01:35:15,079
phone together with the information that

1593
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:18,079
the operating system has you know the

1594
01:35:15,079 --> 01:35:23,780
whole life story of one person let's

1595
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:29,179
look at another BD watt DDP this is the

1596
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:31,190
contact list what's up asks access to

1597
01:35:29,179 --> 01:35:33,199
all your contacts on the phone that's to

1598
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:37,159
see whether the contracts that you've

1599
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:40,428
got in your phone have got o whatsapp

1600
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:44,869
Earth installed so it'll read all the

1601
01:35:40,429 --> 01:35:47,119
contacts and if if they've got whatsapp

1602
01:35:44,869 --> 01:35:50,719
installed you can talk to that person

1603
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:54,469
with what's how you manage that it's G B

1604
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:57,170
D these are just some of the contacts

1605
01:35:54,469 --> 01:36:00,650
that I've got in my address book that

1606
01:35:57,170 --> 01:36:05,630
I've got whatsapp the status is another

1607
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:07,429
interesting this thing status is it's

1608
01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:12,829
this the personal sense of having what's

1609
01:36:07,429 --> 01:36:20,989
up there's people that insult others via

1610
01:36:12,829 --> 01:36:30,499
status they harass people status and on

1611
01:36:20,989 --> 01:36:33,468
the status table you can see it when you

1612
01:36:30,499 --> 01:36:35,539
can see using when the status as updated

1613
01:36:33,469 --> 01:36:37,369
whether they update it every month or

1614
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:39,650
they didn't update it for the last three

1615
01:36:37,369 --> 01:36:41,630
years the number is there a real

1616
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:44,780
telephone number not the what's up

1617
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:48,949
telephone number so I've saved it in my

1618
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:51,710
agenda if I've saved it here you can see

1619
01:36:48,949 --> 01:36:57,289
plus 34 plus 34 and the mood we store

1620
01:36:51,710 --> 01:37:00,289
information displaying is what I changed

1621
01:36:57,289 --> 01:37:04,039
before it's the name that I've saved for

1622
01:37:00,289 --> 01:37:08,329
example I write any old thing here or an

1623
01:37:04,039 --> 01:37:10,940
insult oh I just said I can share this

1624
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:12,829
contact with somebody

1625
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:14,539
they'll it'll appear as that same old

1626
01:37:12,829 --> 01:37:15,889
pain in the neck because that's what

1627
01:37:14,539 --> 01:37:17,750
I've saved it does the same old pain in

1628
01:37:15,889 --> 01:37:22,309
the neck

1629
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:22,309
there's anything else of interest here

1630
01:37:22,699 --> 01:37:27,379
let's move on to number 17

1631
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:51,070
mallalieu Siemens account Quinton sir

1632
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:54,700
this counts the number of messages that

1633
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:57,299
this contact hasn't read so if he's sent

1634
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:59,889
20 messages and they've not been read

1635
01:37:57,300 --> 01:38:05,830
it'll tell you that so that's quite

1636
01:37:59,890 --> 01:38:07,990
useful and you can also see the day that

1637
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:10,090
you modified your whatsapp photo if you

1638
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:12,519
want to know when they updated the photo

1639
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:17,140
recently we can you can see that

1640
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:22,600
let's now leave database and now let's

1641
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:27,520
look at what's up directories I think

1642
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:30,040
we're on number 17 files files in the

1643
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:34,420
internal memory saves all this

1644
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:37,450
information if we go to avatars here

1645
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:40,030
that it saves all those images of all

1646
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:43,000
the users and all the contacts that I

1647
01:38:40,030 --> 01:38:46,809
have in what's up and of course mine as

1648
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:48,430
well and all the others all the other

1649
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:49,660
contacts that I have in Watts up I've

1650
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:52,960
got their photo and their telephone

1651
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:54,910
number might be a witch which I don't

1652
01:38:52,960 --> 01:39:03,930
know what that is somebody that kept

1653
01:38:54,910 --> 01:39:09,130
this on what's up however it's got all

1654
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:14,560
Albertus in it but in just files we've

1655
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:16,240
got me dot jpg this is interesting cuz

1656
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:18,370
it's downloaded from a server I don't

1657
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:22,420
know if you've ever had that when you've

1658
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:25,240
installed whatsapp from scratch the

1659
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:28,540
photo that you had appears again that's

1660
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:30,400
because it's saved in the server not the

1661
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:32,080
one that's in avatars but this one it

1662
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:34,509
takes it down from the server so you can

1663
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:37,930
see when it was created when it was

1664
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:40,690
installed etc and then we've got this

1665
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:44,710
other file which is me me saves

1666
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:53,129
information such as the phone number

1667
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:53,130
that I've linked which one is joined

1668
01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:01,340
this is the one that I've linked of

1669
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:03,890
course it's not this one but this in

1670
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:06,590
theory is that phone number that I've

1671
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:10,550
used to operate with this what's up and

1672
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:12,890
you can see all the places where you can

1673
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:16,940
duplicate and triplicate all these

1674
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:22,550
things key the key this is what allows

1675
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:25,099
us to decipher the databases that are

1676
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:26,630
outside in dot crypt with this key if

1677
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:30,680
you can manage to extract it and I've

1678
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:33,170
extracted I can decipher the external

1679
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:35,710
data base that I have in the phone and

1680
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:39,140
then status of course that's the same as

1681
01:40:35,710 --> 01:40:49,400
before it shows you this my status the

1682
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:51,800
one that I've put on what's up esta la

1683
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:55,969
memoria mr and these are the file such

1684
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:58,580
an external memory any body can access

1685
01:40:55,970 --> 01:40:59,990
these external files you don't need to

1686
01:40:58,580 --> 01:41:01,880
be rude or anything else that I

1687
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:08,150
mentioned what sort of files do we have

1688
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:13,130
here in database we've got the the nine

1689
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:15,769
most recent security copies that I've

1690
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:20,120
got these were updated on 2:00 a.m. in

1691
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:22,700
the morning it's actually it makes a

1692
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:25,880
complete backup and that is encrypted

1693
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:27,800
with the key that I showed you before

1694
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:30,980
which is stored in the part that you can

1695
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:34,250
give here you've got all the dates if

1696
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:37,639
there's one that doesn't appear either

1697
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:39,860
the whatsup was turned off or the phone

1698
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:44,720
was turned off because every day it

1699
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:48,259
should have made this backup and in the

1700
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:53,690
meantime in media you can see PDFs that

1701
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:56,949
you've uploaded photos etc this is a

1702
01:41:53,690 --> 01:42:00,428
photo that I received

1703
01:41:56,949 --> 01:42:03,759
and this is frozen I've sent if it's

1704
01:42:00,429 --> 01:42:06,730
here it's received if and it's it's

1705
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:08,920
because I've sent how do I know that

1706
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:09,580
it's this photo not a different one that

1707
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:15,040
I sent

1708
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:20,350
well you just click on it and you type

1709
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:21,610
in sha-256 some and you can calculate it

1710
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:26,110
this is the hash okay

1711
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:30,820
the pictures hash it doesn't let me

1712
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:33,910
access it because I don't have internet

1713
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:40,719
connection I'm gonna try to sign off and

1714
01:42:33,910 --> 01:43:15,519
sign on again I just need to connect to

1715
01:42:40,719 --> 01:43:17,949
change to base64 okay if not here we've

1716
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:21,190
created a number in base64 and where is

1717
01:43:17,949 --> 01:43:30,309
this number in base64 if we go back to

1718
01:43:21,190 --> 01:43:32,400
the MSG store and we look at this table

1719
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:32,400
again

1720
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:51,199
here we go to the messages where

1721
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:51,199
everything's stored here in this table

1722
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:59,579
this number if the hush that I took her

1723
01:43:56,340 --> 01:44:03,119
out of words converts it to base64 there

1724
01:43:59,579 --> 01:44:07,259
it is they have their liberties I take

1725
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:11,130
the hash and I convert it and it gives

1726
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:17,579
me the information in base64 but it

1727
01:44:11,130 --> 01:44:22,230
doesn't coincide why because I've put it

1728
01:44:17,579 --> 01:44:29,579
in text a hash doesn't have zeros ones

1729
01:44:22,230 --> 01:44:32,659
or N or N and you so you can put and go

1730
01:44:29,579 --> 01:44:32,659
back to the database

1731
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:59,800
well as portable school sei unit table

1732
01:44:57,579 --> 01:45:03,489
Telecom intenders discuss the operations

1733
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:06,039
has concrete oh but in base64 you can

1734
01:45:03,489 --> 01:45:09,879
see the file that I sent in here we can

1735
01:45:06,039 --> 01:45:13,570
see this is the file that's on the

1736
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:21,219
database and not another one so here we

1737
01:45:13,570 --> 01:45:25,058
can see this is the same file they just

1738
01:45:21,219 --> 01:45:31,170
have to calculate 256 and then put it

1739
01:45:25,059 --> 01:45:38,829
into base64 and to finish a final lesson

1740
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:43,150
which i think is number 19 which is lot

1741
01:45:38,829 --> 01:45:44,980
log file the look for has lots of

1742
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:49,659
informations got you can see lots of

1743
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:52,209
code lines what I've shown you here in

1744
01:45:49,659 --> 01:45:53,379
my presentation I'll explain to you so

1745
01:45:52,210 --> 01:45:59,590
you've got an idea of what I'm talking

1746
01:45:53,380 --> 01:46:02,860
about if we find this string with grep

1747
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:10,510
what you'll find is the phone numbers

1748
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:13,210
that have started a session of course

1749
01:46:10,510 --> 01:46:15,760
there should only be one plus 5 in this

1750
01:46:13,210 --> 01:46:19,000
case it means that the phone has been

1751
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:22,480
linked to different devices and/or

1752
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:25,449
different SIM cards we've got another

1753
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:29,079
one which is MSG store backup which

1754
01:46:25,449 --> 01:46:31,150
tells us the date when the most and

1755
01:46:29,079 --> 01:46:33,130
career the most recent encrypted to

1756
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:35,679
backup was made every day at 2:00 a.m.

1757
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:38,289
in the morning it should be there if

1758
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:41,289
this isn't doesn't appear in our log

1759
01:46:38,289 --> 01:46:44,349
table it means that the mobile was

1760
01:46:41,289 --> 01:46:48,159
switched off but if we find this here

1761
01:46:44,349 --> 01:46:52,510
and we don't find an external file it

1762
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:56,259
means that somebody's rubbed it out it

1763
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:59,800
means that the encrypted database has

1764
01:46:56,260 --> 01:47:02,320
been rubbed out in block list we can

1765
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:03,760
know which ones we've blocked you know

1766
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,478
the typical pain in the ass that keeps

1767
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:07,059
sending us

1768
01:47:04,479 --> 01:47:08,319
messages he appears on block list if we

1769
01:47:07,059 --> 01:47:11,289
look for the block list

1770
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:13,929
string you can see all the phone numbers

1771
01:47:11,289 --> 01:47:18,249
that we've blocked and the date that we

1772
01:47:13,929 --> 01:47:20,649
blocked them of course this is repeated

1773
01:47:18,249 --> 01:47:23,529
if we look for group info now you'll see

1774
01:47:20,649 --> 01:47:25,839
those users that were within a group

1775
01:47:23,529 --> 01:47:27,369
it's easier to see it here than

1776
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:30,459
somewhere else because here what you've

1777
01:47:27,369 --> 01:47:32,139
got the name of the group the telephone

1778
01:47:30,459 --> 01:47:35,108
of the administrator and all of those

1779
01:47:32,139 --> 01:47:39,689
people that are in that group in just a

1780
01:47:35,109 --> 01:47:42,309
txt you can see it and contact status

1781
01:47:39,689 --> 01:47:47,799
here you can see the status once again

1782
01:47:42,309 --> 01:47:51,909
of this contact so if there are four

1783
01:47:47,799 --> 01:47:55,859
months ago they spent time insulting

1784
01:47:51,909 --> 01:47:58,749
somebody by contact status you can see

1785
01:47:55,859 --> 01:48:01,629
you can see the date and what they wrote

1786
01:47:58,749 --> 01:48:03,789
what about we fee we can see when the

1787
01:48:01,629 --> 01:48:11,699
phone was connected to a wireless

1788
01:48:03,789 --> 01:48:11,699
because here you can see the date and

1789
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:20,499
the type of wireless connection so you

1790
01:48:16,889 --> 01:48:21,399
now know that if the phones are right up

1791
01:48:20,499 --> 01:48:22,449
in the middle of the mountain it

1792
01:48:21,399 --> 01:48:25,239
probably won't be connected at a

1793
01:48:22,449 --> 01:48:27,518
wireless but anyway the same thing this

1794
01:48:25,239 --> 01:48:32,039
is it's the same thing for Android which

1795
01:48:27,519 --> 01:48:36,069
actually keeps the a wireless name and

1796
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:44,648
password the password that was used to

1797
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:47,649
link mobile you can get the ISP that we

1798
01:48:44,649 --> 01:48:49,389
were connected to for example I've got

1799
01:48:47,649 --> 01:48:52,709
telefónica MOU based on my phone and

1800
01:48:49,389 --> 01:48:56,409
here it'll put telefónica so i know what

1801
01:48:52,709 --> 01:49:01,869
network my mobile phone is using at a

1802
01:48:56,409 --> 01:49:05,888
given moment in time and then 53 y 53 53

1803
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:10,940
is the UDP port which the dns is work

1804
01:49:05,889 --> 01:49:13,820
for if I search for 53 I can

1805
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:16,879
the domain resolution IP that my

1806
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:19,400
telephone has I can see I've been if

1807
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:23,420
I've been attacked because it's

1808
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:26,629
historical log device battery here it

1809
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:30,260
tells us if the phone was charging or

1810
01:49:26,630 --> 01:49:33,140
discharging here you can see the battery

1811
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:36,410
level and how it gradually goes down

1812
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:40,330
sixty four fifty two forty three that

1813
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:49,340
means that it's not connected to the

1814
01:49:40,330 --> 01:49:52,480
charger and here you can see it's

1815
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:55,910
connected one and the battery goes up

1816
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:57,799
plugged one you can see that just as in

1817
01:49:55,910 --> 01:49:59,930
the what's that blog so the what what's

1818
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:02,060
up knows if we're charging when we

1819
01:49:59,930 --> 01:50:04,610
plugged it in when we unplug it and when

1820
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:07,660
we've plugged it back in again and just

1821
01:50:04,610 --> 01:50:12,040
to finish now alternative access methods

1822
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:14,840
this is the final last resource that you

1823
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:19,670
should use to get information about a

1824
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:21,380
phone this is emergency when there's no

1825
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:22,940
other way of getting information for

1826
01:50:21,380 --> 01:50:26,780
example when what's up could downgrade

1827
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:29,629
doesn't work or there's no possibility

1828
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:35,599
of routing the device or you need to

1829
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:37,550
analyze the database in depth I could

1830
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:39,770
see that conversations on the screen but

1831
01:50:37,550 --> 01:50:43,430
maybe I need to know every single thing

1832
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:46,670
whether I've got it via whatsapp web or

1833
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:49,430
whatever so what do you need you need a

1834
01:50:46,670 --> 01:50:52,640
sim access that's not that difficult

1835
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:55,970
access to the SD card a public side of

1836
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:59,060
it because there's no key and some kinds

1837
01:50:55,970 --> 01:51:01,100
of other a virtual or physical terminal

1838
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:03,530
which is routed and we go to the lab so

1839
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:09,680
what do we do we copy the encrypted

1840
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:13,820
database from the original mobile we

1841
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:17,120
copy it we stick it in our SD card in

1842
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:23,780
our lab a mobile

1843
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:28,780
there you can see it so it's copied in

1844
01:51:23,780 --> 01:51:33,490
the external memory in our lab machine

1845
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:36,530
we can check that there's no Arthur

1846
01:51:33,490 --> 01:51:39,800
versions of whatsup installed and we

1847
01:51:36,530 --> 01:51:44,990
install what's up from zero from scratch

1848
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:48,500
we install it we put the telephone

1849
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:51,019
we just need to access the cards SMS

1850
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:53,270
says the phone number and that says do

1851
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:56,380
you want to restore your security copy

1852
01:51:53,270 --> 01:52:02,050
yes and then what's up

1853
01:51:56,380 --> 01:52:05,120
ask the SMS number it will get it all

1854
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:09,380
decipher the database and copy it

1855
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:11,510
locally so we've got rooted and we can

1856
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:14,660
access the internal database we can copy

1857
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:15,830
it and then extract all the information

1858
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:19,430
that otherwise we wouldn't have been

1859
01:52:15,830 --> 01:52:21,290
able to and this is another method this

1860
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:23,750
is a far more reckless than the previous

1861
01:52:21,290 --> 01:52:27,410
one but it works you need to know what

1862
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:31,940
you're up to there which is to it invent

1863
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:36,830
a chat send a chat by email to print it

1864
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:43,040
out you don't normally send it by email

1865
01:52:36,830 --> 01:52:47,350
so how do you do that what's that powers

1866
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:49,880
of the option of sending chats by email

1867
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:54,650
without data so you can send that and

1868
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:58,390
you add it to an email whatever once

1869
01:52:54,650 --> 01:53:01,940
you've done that you keep it as a draft

1870
01:52:58,390 --> 01:53:06,460
of course we're tampering with evidence

1871
01:53:01,940 --> 01:53:09,370
but that's any way we can do it we go to

1872
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:12,390
draft

1873
01:53:09,370 --> 01:53:15,550
and we can open it open it with an HTML

1874
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:18,460
view err so we open it and that's what

1875
01:53:15,550 --> 01:53:28,050
it shows us we can read it and we can

1876
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:28,050
copy it so we select all copy it paste

1877
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:38,620
it where we do have access it's not easy

1878
01:53:34,900 --> 01:53:40,360
but if you're a forensic here's a camera

1879
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:48,300
that you can record the mobile what

1880
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:53,099
would you rather have a 15 minute video

1881
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:57,010
somebody actually downloading videos

1882
01:53:53,100 --> 01:54:00,100
that's the best way of using a forensic

1883
01:53:57,010 --> 01:54:03,220
software and finally everything that

1884
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:04,990
we've done all the information needs to

1885
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:10,890
be signed to digitally how do you do

1886
01:54:04,990 --> 01:54:10,889
that you create a hash you can calculate

1887
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:22,300
and then you can package it up and you

1888
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:24,519
compress the hash of this the only thing

1889
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:28,240
you need to do is to always have to sign

1890
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:30,640
evidence digitally sign evidence you

1891
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:31,929
can't tamper with the information and

1892
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:34,090
that you extract and with everything

1893
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:36,730
that I've explained to you you can

1894
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:38,380
actually get information from a little

1895
01:54:36,730 --> 01:54:39,910
what's up and what you know what the

1896
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:44,050
best thing about this talk is that

1897
01:54:39,910 --> 01:54:46,840
possibly tomorrow what I've told you

1898
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:48,970
probably won't be useless because

1899
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:53,280
they'll have changed everything that

1900
01:54:48,970 --> 01:54:58,600
I've done but anyway I hope not so

1901
01:54:53,280 --> 01:55:00,519
remember it's not a matter of doing it

1902
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:04,330
today and forgetting it tomorrow you

1903
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:07,240
have to be on the ball day after day you

1904
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:09,970
have to want to find out how things work

1905
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:11,980
and you have to be motivated and that's

1906
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:14,800
how we can get all that information even

1907
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:16,599
more information from what's up and I've

1908
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:20,140
shown you over the last two hours thank

1909
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:22,499
you for having spent the last two hours

1910
01:55:20,140 --> 01:55:26,039
with me and we've got any

1911
01:55:22,499 --> 01:55:26,039
questions please

1912
01:55:26,789 --> 01:55:33,119
ask me now five minutes for questions

1913
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:52,560
I can hear you but maybe at the back

1914
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:55,590
they can't do you will see further ok

1915
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:57,890
encryption when when the Mobile's

1916
01:55:55,590 --> 01:56:02,790
completely encrypted

1917
01:55:57,890 --> 01:56:06,090
how can you access these data how do you

1918
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:08,550
think you could solve this there

1919
01:56:06,090 --> 01:56:12,740
different ways of encrypting mobile

1920
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:16,530
devices there it can be a password a

1921
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:20,940
fingerprint but depending upon the type

1922
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:27,360
of encryption it is but normally it's

1923
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:31,080
via the router depending upon the level

1924
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:32,670
of vulnerability that it has it may well

1925
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:34,650
be that I can't access some part of the

1926
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:38,280
system but the other but it is it it's

1927
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:39,900
easy that's why because you don't want

1928
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:42,269
people to see information that's not

1929
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:48,360
there so it's it's not easy but there

1930
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:50,610
are different alternative methods and in

1931
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:53,929
a if you're free to trial you've got

1932
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:57,839
somebody's encrypted mobile the time

1933
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:59,520
that you need to decipher it is it

1934
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:03,060
feasible it depends upon upon how

1935
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:07,380
important the Mobile is and and the

1936
01:57:03,060 --> 01:57:12,240
possibility of encryption but it really

1937
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:15,720
depends on each system we then do it for

1938
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:19,880
all mobiles on offer all evidence are

1939
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:19,880
you got any other more questions

1940
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:33,840
do you know any anti forensic techniques

1941
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:36,449
can I as a user avoid you doing all of

1942
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:40,860
this yes of course I do

1943
01:57:36,449 --> 01:57:42,329
I can you share that with us you can

1944
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:46,848
only ask a question I'm not gonna sorry

1945
01:57:42,329 --> 01:57:49,380
gonna reply to the question this is like

1946
01:57:46,849 --> 01:57:56,610
the genie in the lamp

1947
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:58,889
there are many anti forensic tests but

1948
01:57:56,610 --> 01:58:03,329
I'm not gonna talk about that that's not

1949
01:57:58,889 --> 01:58:04,829
the object of this talk so you guys can

1950
01:58:03,329 --> 01:58:07,049
go stay put a probe on the ribbon does

1951
01:58:04,829 --> 01:58:17,940
complicate I'm not prepared to reply to

1952
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:19,679
complicated questions I will have me

1953
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:23,879
number says what my name is

1954
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:27,719
Edward I wanted to ask in when we looked

1955
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:30,719
at the message tablet there was a

1956
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:33,349
message ID and you strung them to each

1957
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:36,769
other he joined them to each other so

1958
01:58:33,349 --> 01:58:40,380
you said that in a real case the

1959
01:58:36,769 --> 01:58:43,380
database can be very big so how do you

1960
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:46,110
check the correlation how can you check

1961
01:58:43,380 --> 01:58:48,889
that all the messages are correlated

1962
01:58:46,110 --> 01:58:48,889
well

1963
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:59,730
to the left you'll see the row line and

1964
01:58:55,860 --> 01:59:02,730
if you see it's row 40 and the IDS on 30

1965
01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:05,700
you know that you've got ten left you

1966
01:59:02,730 --> 01:59:08,009
can either do it manually or you can

1967
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:09,120
encrypt it in Python it's like an island

1968
01:59:08,010 --> 01:59:18,080
table so I trying to find something on

1969
01:59:09,120 --> 01:59:18,080
excel what about the function of

1970
01:59:19,010 --> 01:59:26,760
removing a message how is that recorded

1971
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:31,530
on your screen it'll say this message

1972
01:59:26,760 --> 01:59:35,040
has been removed but at a forensic level

1973
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:39,990
or it is rights over it so it writes

1974
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:44,250
over the line the code line yeah so is

1975
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:46,679
it lost there no for example I eliminate

1976
01:59:44,250 --> 01:59:50,550
this and I and I put hello hello ello

1977
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:53,640
ello but the ID still where it should be

1978
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:54,990
so does it keep the ID yes it does keep

1979
01:59:53,640 --> 02:00:00,630
the ideas that's what you're asking

1980
01:59:54,990 --> 02:00:04,410
and finally if they've got a real case

1981
02:00:00,630 --> 02:00:07,580
of the forensic publishing his report

1982
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:07,580
goes to court

1983
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:11,869
[Music]

1984
02:00:14,270 --> 02:00:19,740
how's it all backed up with all I mean

1985
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:24,570
how does the judge interpret the data

1986
02:00:19,740 --> 02:00:29,309
that you offer is there any kind of

1987
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:33,950
official documents no no it's based on

1988
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:39,120
the evidence that the proof so if you

1989
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:40,650
can't debate with me that it's not you

1990
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:44,610
you're gonna have to tell me that it's

1991
02:00:40,650 --> 02:00:47,639
not that's not true it's a bit visceral

1992
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:50,400
but you have to do lots of drawings and

1993
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:52,140
colors and things thank you any further

1994
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:56,690
questions my goodness there's six

1995
02:00:52,140 --> 02:01:02,160
questions out there okay off you go

1996
02:00:56,690 --> 02:01:04,589
it's there any way of knowing how they

1997
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:09,150
you whether they user conversations are

1998
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:11,490
complete if they've got a copy seer of

1999
02:01:09,150 --> 02:01:12,599
the sim if they've taken the sim out and

2000
02:01:11,490 --> 02:01:15,090
put it in another device and had two

2001
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:17,340
other conversations as soon as you take

2002
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:21,300
the sim out the device the what's up

2003
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:22,910
will still work in the same way I take

2004
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:26,550
the sim out of my device

2005
02:01:22,910 --> 02:01:29,190
I've taken the what's up with it until

2006
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:31,560
that sim isn't a link to another

2007
02:01:29,190 --> 02:01:34,019
telephone and link to that other

2008
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:36,150
telephone I can carry on operating as

2009
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:38,250
well so until it's linked to another

2010
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:40,440
telephone the database will still be

2011
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:42,540
here when it's linked to another phone

2012
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:45,089
this is not going to be recorded but in

2013
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:47,820
the new one in the what's up blog will

2014
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:49,350
you say with indication error talk that

2015
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:53,360
day that hour if you see that with

2016
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:57,180
education error means the same card is

2017
02:01:53,360 --> 02:02:00,269
failed or it's not inside or anybody has

2018
02:01:57,180 --> 02:02:02,100
registered in a remote another location

2019
02:02:00,270 --> 02:02:05,940
but somebody would do it intentionally

2020
02:02:02,100 --> 02:02:09,840
not to leave any trace especially to

2021
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:12,690
delete some conversations yes they would

2022
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:14,610
need to change phone and that we never

2023
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:17,790
find the phone that the person has used

2024
02:02:14,610 --> 02:02:19,320
yes because the database is kept in in

2025
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:23,690
another place because of it's a

2026
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:23,690
different phone can we

2027
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:32,760
ask the whatsapp company to ask for that

2028
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:36,930
because we have a legal order no did

2029
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:38,640
whatsapp give you any information no if

2030
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:40,170
a thing is encrypted they cannot give

2031
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:43,860
you a name for me they don't know the

2032
02:02:40,170 --> 02:02:46,100
content of the messages I don't know the

2033
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:52,559
last question

2034
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:54,180
raise your hands nobody oh my this

2035

congratulations I just loved that I have

2040
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:10,860
it out you said to extract the database

2041
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:15,510
from the mobile is quite complex

2042
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:19,650
you use who booth it's yes the pan I

2043
02:03:15,510 --> 02:03:22,530
showed you how does it work how does it

2044
02:03:19,650 --> 02:03:25,410
work with these restrictions you said

2045
02:03:22,530 --> 02:03:27,330
you say the second hand machines are not

2046
02:03:25,410 --> 02:03:30,590
very very expensive tell me where tell

2047
02:03:27,330 --> 02:03:33,330
me where you buy that they're not cheap

2048
02:03:30,590 --> 02:03:37,530
it's it's a memory dump that you do

2049
02:03:33,330 --> 02:03:40,260
depends when you use this tool it's not

2050
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:42,179
a big button you have different types of

2051
02:03:40,260 --> 02:03:45,780
extractions according to the mobile

2052
02:03:42,180 --> 02:03:47,460
phone it's a different dumping or you

2053
02:03:45,780 --> 02:03:49,290
can get in in under different why

2054
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:52,680
depends on the phone it's not it's not

2055
02:03:49,290 --> 02:03:55,860
automatic you select the model yes this

2056
02:03:52,680 --> 02:04:00,000
is a phone Sony Xperia whatever and it

2057
02:03:55,860 --> 02:04:02,489
says to you what you can do it's a

2058
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,890
cloner you know I don't know if you used

2059
02:04:02,489 --> 02:04:09,080
hard drive cloner it's not difficult and

2060
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:12,630
and to exit everything is ok

2061
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:14,340
the you fede is just the same you have a

2062
02:04:12,630 --> 02:04:16,280
very complex off to be hunted but for

2063
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:19,380
you they user it's very very handy

2064
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:21,960
that's why it's very popular it's very

2065
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:24,270
comfortable next next next and then you

2066
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:25,650
have the information that is copied to

2067
02:04:24,270 --> 02:04:30,810
another location where you can analyze

2068
02:04:25,650 --> 02:04:34,280
it okay it's low level functioning it

2069
02:04:30,810 --> 02:04:36,200
well it's the designers mine

2070
02:04:34,280 --> 02:04:38,750
I don't know if it's baby or Android

2071
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:41,420
back up the same that I used but it's

2072
02:04:38,750 --> 02:04:43,460
Ultima automated and it knows how it

2073
02:04:41,420 --> 02:04:45,110
needs to attack them up the specific

2074
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:47,750
model of the phone it's a database of

2075
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:50,679
phones and what you can do to that phone

2076
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:53,839
module thank you very much everybody

2077
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:53,839
