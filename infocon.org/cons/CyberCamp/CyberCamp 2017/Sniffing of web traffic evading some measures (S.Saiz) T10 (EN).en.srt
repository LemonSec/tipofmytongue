00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:28,330
Oh hola what hey good morning everybody

2
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,330
how are you doing with this cyber camp

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:44,390
welcome to this workshop on how to sniff

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:47,840
web traffic we're gonna look at some of

5
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,850
the means of doing so and first and

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,089
foremost are going to introduce myself

7
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:57,970
to you I'm safe you're safe I'm the

8
00:00:53,089 --> 00:01:02,839
co-founder and director of the acongress

9
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:04,989
cyber security and at the end of January

10
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:10,789
will be holding holding the fourth year

11
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:15,229
in Santander I currently work Nikia and

12
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:19,760
I'm in charge of security and here

13
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:21,829
I've put some headlines of companies and

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,020
the things that I've been doing I'm not

15
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:29,479
gonna hand the floor over to my

16
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:34,250
colleague hello good morning my name is

17
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:36,079
Alberto sulfonyl I'm known as Alberto I

18
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,869
see Casey so if you've got anything just

19
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,779
you want to ask and I think please just

20
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:46,850
ask me use my Christian name I work

21
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:49,990
alongside surf here and I'm working with

22
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:56,560
him on net kiya on systems and networks

23
00:01:49,990 --> 00:02:03,429
and not just on security issues I'm

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:08,538
interested in anonymity in free software

25
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:10,509
let's now start a talk it's a really

26
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:13,578
important talk

27
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,578
[Music]

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,520
how many of you have connected to a

29
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:29,550
hotel wireless I'm not talking about a

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:38,320
paid one but even a free of charge one

31
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:43,290
just one person that I might share

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:49,390
you've checked your email you surprised

33
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:52,950
and you know what you're exposed to as

34
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,950
long as you're aware of that

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:06,880
another thing is completely the opposite

36
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,880
so let's talk a little bit more about

37
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:14,140
the world of sniffing so that you can

38
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:18,880
see how easier it is for somebody to

39
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:23,500
catch your data especially in the case

40
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:26,709
of adolescents data consumption in roga

41
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,660
when we see an open network you see and

42
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,489
you connect it and you know what that

43
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,109
involves we don't know who's behind it

44
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:38,980
we don't know who's managing it even

45
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:41,250
typical networks such as open cafes as

46
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,359
long as you're aware that to what you're

47
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,730
connecting to you're risking something

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,380
need to be aware of that and it may well

49
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,480
be that a few months later in a

50
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,480
different city in in a different country

51
00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,609
and there's another cafeteria with an

52
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:03,760
open wallet in your mobile directly

53
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,080
connects to this wireless network and

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,179
you didn't realize that you've been

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:12,730
connected so you need to be careful

56
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:17,709
especially with smartphones or wireless

57
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:19,238
connections etc just with NFC and

58
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:25,539
Bluetooth

59
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:29,770
so let's carry on looking at and see how

60
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:40,919
easy it is to be exposed to a

61
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:40,919
man-in-the-middle attack and the way

62
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:51,130
traffic is sniff and to see the traffic

63
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:53,590
that's being sent out or received here

64
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,060
we're going to explain the important

65
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,349
most common and most well known

66
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,770
technique which is violet man in the

67
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:04,449
middle which is a technique based

68
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,830
basically placing myself right in the

69
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:13,990
middle of the communication between the

70
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:17,289
victim and in this case the Rooter as

71
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,360
you can see in the diagram there we are

72
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:23,469
right in the middle here you can see

73
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:27,280
another kind of diagram where you can

74
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,849
see that we're right in the middle of a

75
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,849
communication

76
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:36,370
there are all sorts of hundreds of

77
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,280
diagrams like this one this isn't just

78
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:48,190
the only one and this is basically it's

79
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:51,880
a man-in-the-middle I'd like to say that

80
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:55,630
this isn't a normal kind of a talk it's

81
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:59,219
a workshop so we're gonna do several

82
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:01,630
exercises here so that you can see how

83
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,160
you can get right in the middle of a

84
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:09,909
communication how you can see the

85
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:16,270
traffic and how if things don't work as

86
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:19,240
we've been trying them sometimes things

87
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,539
fail and don't work right going to the

88
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,040
right first time you can imagine

89
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,190
sometimes you put a lot of effort into

90
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,590
it and then it doesn't work sometimes

91
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,930
there's a 3G problem or any kind of

92
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:40,299
other connection problems so let's start

93
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:42,660
doing our exercises thank you if I can

94
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,660
close this

95
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,890
this is a user

96
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:41,280
but my other secrecy okay

97
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:47,810
Salameh so not bein a I say hey can you

98
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:52,070
see this on the screen anyway the

99
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:56,670
technique that's most frequently used to

100
00:07:52,070 --> 00:08:02,700
to do the man in the middle is to use

101
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:05,310
our pace poot RP spoofing it comes from

102
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:10,370
RP tables and for those of you that have

103
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:10,370
not heard of RP spoofing mmm RP

104
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:22,820
resolution protocol it's a an address

105
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:25,830
protocol resolution it's as if it was in

106
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:31,890
layer 2 and what this protocol does is

107
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:37,169
it translates IP addresses into smart

108
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:43,289
addresses so when a customer connects to

109
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:47,520
the network if you have connectivity

110
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:52,020
with other pieces of equipment a packet

111
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,870
of B request packet is sent where they

112
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,870
ask whose own cells

113
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:03,180
this is sent to the broadcast address

114
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:07,380
and whoever has this IP address replies

115
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:10,010
and says is me and then the other

116
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,010
colleagues

117
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:22,559
picks it up right sit down in there are

118
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:25,079
P so for this technique as if you're an

119
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:30,329
attack of your hacker what you do is you

120
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:35,339
send continually time and time again RP

121
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:37,019
reply packets which is a reply to a

122
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,389
supposed to request which hasn't been

123
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:45,259
carried out but we reply to it and we

124
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:49,860
say hello I'm the router this is my map

125
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:55,589
so you give them the route address will

126
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:58,049
give them 192 168 1 1 and Mac is this

127
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:01,049
one and this response packet is being

128
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:05,279
sent for example to the victim that we

129
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:09,629
want to attack if it's one or several or

130
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,829
everybody at the same time so do you see

131
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:12,829
what I'm getting at are you following me

132
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:32,279
so now let's do the first demo and you

133
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:34,160
can see here that we arrived I'm the

134
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:38,040
attacker and the first thing that we do

135
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:42,779
very basically is to see what the IP

136
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:46,410
address we have we see what IP address

137
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:54,299
here you can see it there you can see it

138
00:10:46,410 --> 00:11:00,379
102 it ends in what's the link ports IP

139
00:10:54,299 --> 00:11:00,379
address where do trace at route

140
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:17,010
dot yes and let's see if it replies here

141
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,010
you can see the the link point number

142
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:25,420
and what's the next thing we do we try

143
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:35,920
to see what other clients are connected

144
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:40,500
to this network just we launch so we do

145
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,500
an SP two one nine two once eight eight

146
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:53,439
from one one two one two three five it's

147
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:58,750
checking it's pinging all the eyepiece

148
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:08,920
and the any that reply will they'll give

149
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:14,400
us the information Valley Aki vemos and

150
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,400
here you can see this replied

151
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,080
the link points that suggest one one

152
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:26,060
that's replied at the bottom of

153
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:35,350
everything we've got 100 to 1 103 and

154
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:39,099
one 100 this is an iPhone by the way

155
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,100
have you got your iPhone

156
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:50,330
Rafa haha m-mother pose Achilles area

157
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,900
question only comment and this is just a

158
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:58,730
matter of choosing a victim of now I

159
00:12:52,900 --> 00:13:03,079
know he's won 100 so just need to choose

160
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:12,160
a victim randomly if we know it's that's

161
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:19,090
fine fantastic so how do we carry on

162
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:24,290
using our piece booth which is a tool

163
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:28,820
which we use for this ARP spoof um we

164
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:33,860
can see how to spend our P reply packets

165
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:35,840
to the victim because whether we've got

166
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,380
the Reuter IP address why are we doing

167
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:43,100
that is so that the victim sends things

168
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:46,490
to us I'm also do the reverse will get

169
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:51,440
the victim will get the Reuter and will

170
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:56,510
say to the router that the address of is

171
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:02,960
the same as our Mac we'll do this with

172
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:09,939
ARP spoof the network interface the

173
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:13,280
victim which is in this case 192 168 1 0

174
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:19,390
we do it the other way around and the

175
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,390
link port 1 I 2 1 6 8 1 1

176
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:29,050
so here we can see how we're sending our

177
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:34,420
P reply packets directly our peer

178
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:36,910
replies is at and you can see the MAC

179
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:39,969
address which is always the same one and

180
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:43,600
we're saying it 2 1 1 and 1 100 that's

181
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:47,470
why they are going to write down on

182
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,660
their RP table these data when this IP

183
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,990
address is sent it's translated and then

184
00:14:49,660 --> 00:15:01,300
it's sent to our network card you got it

185
00:14:52,990 --> 00:15:03,490
simple yeah if the victim tries to

186
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,010
browse just to give you an idea I think

187
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,280
that I've got to do this check that I've

188
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:20,610
got the IP 100 and we've got a nut a

189
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:20,610
browser first I did it in flat HTTP

190
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:34,780
what's happening here the person can't

191
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:37,600
browse why we're doing service refusal

192
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:43,150
that victim receives a service refusal

193
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:48,730
because by default our machine doesn't

194
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:50,410
route traffic it either goes adjoins or

195
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,220
leaves but it doesn't forward traffic

196
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,219
brook

197
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:02,118
there you can see IP forward

198
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:16,150
I don't know if you can see the top one

199
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:19,210
this file as a zero so it can't the

200
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:27,819
machine can't forward traffic what we

201
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:31,620
need to do is to establish it at one and

202
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,620
then we're going to refresh the page

203
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:50,069
now you can see it's you can see the

204
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:53,009
brows it and no now I'm looking at the

205
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:58,740
real page and I can't tell what's going

206
00:16:53,009 --> 00:17:01,519
on here we can just see we're right in

207
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,530
the middle of the communication of

208
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,980
course these packets are going via our

209
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:12,599
machine so we can read them we can save

210
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:21,569
them as well what I'm doing here so that

211
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:27,869
you know it's open here to see the

212
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:30,750
traffic and here we can see all the

213
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:40,260
different traffic that's going via our

214
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:46,140
network so here are P requests and

215
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:47,789
responses there's not a lot of traffic

216
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:52,940
so what we're going to do is filter a

217
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:57,270
little bit we just want to see the

218
00:17:52,940 --> 00:18:02,520
packets with an origin original IP

219
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:05,039
address between one and a hundred and we

220
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,720
only want to see HTTP traffic the rest

221
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,720
isn't it of any interest

222
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,550
- your young solar power if I join this

223
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,550
web

224
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:33,179
they're gobbling up all our informations

225
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:38,668
you can see it's accessed this IP

226
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:41,929
address it's gonna get to this web and

227
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:44,730
here you can see below all the HTTP at

228
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:49,559
addresses there's no response

229
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:53,309
because we're filtering it according to

230
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:56,489
who the IP address is all you need to do

231
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:59,220
is to use that filter remove it or apply

232
00:18:56,489 --> 00:19:08,100
it inversely we can put on the origin or

233
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:25,489
the Destiny HTTP address and now we've

234
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:30,899
got the scenario ready if you take the

235
00:19:25,489 --> 00:19:36,029
packets with the image like with web

236
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:38,820
shock so let's apply the reverse filter

237
00:19:36,029 --> 00:19:43,460
so that the IP address the origin IP

238
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,460
address is 37

239
00:19:52,660 --> 00:20:03,110
ending in 134 for and also the ITT P

240
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:10,760
here we can see that a picture's been

241
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:14,990
sent as a response and here we choose

242
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:22,730
this stretch we go back down to the

243
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:24,590
bottom here to there j TP g part so

244
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,000
we've got all the information there and

245
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:36,919
not clicking on the right button export

246
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:40,300
packet bytes and we save it save the the

247
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,300
j jpg image

248
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,890
but it Yeti

249
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:13,140
you can also do this if he's sending a

250
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:16,320
picture let's imagine that what is doing

251
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,070
is accessing his the private section of

252
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:23,330
a cloud undecide uploading or

253
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:29,639
downloading private images in this way

254
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:39,360
we can obtain these images we can also

255
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:44,610
obtain text for example a login if you

256
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:49,969
want we can look at it now this is the

257
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:49,969
filter here so that it's visual

258
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,899
but I feel traumas in Louisville towards

259
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,150
me remember sake okay

260
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:26,690
I'd sooner but if young get al formulary

261
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,690
they login what a pagina they estación

262
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:41,189
well if you'd escaped as Provost estamos

263
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:44,250
utility' known only few alligator okay

264
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:51,780
para mas que no you know fibroid

265
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:53,310
cobertura Valley a insert a lien is

266
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,670
trillion cells normal maintained in a

267
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,669
logging

268
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:18,790
everything's everything with you

269
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:21,969
laughter so now while I still have the

270
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,710
lobby did I live in Kyiv Emma's gone

271
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:28,300
right so what happened here we can see

272
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:32,440
how a post request has been made and if

273
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:36,120
we now go to the the forum section of

274
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,120
things you can see that the fields are

275
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:47,850
log and password and with that we have

276
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:53,920
obtained their username and password

277
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:57,689
easy PC so please be aware when you're

278
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:00,820
using public and open wireless networks

279
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:01,930
so what's the big mistake the big human

280
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,080
mistake here

281
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:08,860
well quite obviously it's been to

282
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:11,679
connect with a web HTTP without an

283
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:18,899
encrypted communication with an SSL TSL

284
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:23,680
that's the mistake so of course to solve

285
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:26,920
this problem we had SSL and then

286
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:33,360
subsequent to that TSL and let's have a

287
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:33,360
look at that now there's also add-ons

288
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:44,529
such as the HTTPS Everywhere which

289
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:49,178
forces all the connections that you work

290
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:52,510
with on internet can only be seen via

291
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:56,980
encrypted traffic with so lets certified

292
00:24:52,510 --> 00:25:02,940
if you've got any trustworthy web which

293
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:02,940
needs HTTP you remove the filters and

294
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:21,760
you've got a safer in relation so other

295
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:23,799
things I'm now gonna cancel the RP

296
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:32,220
spoofing attack and what this tool will

297
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:35,799
do it was reverse the attack as my

298
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:38,230
machine has the MAC addresses of the

299
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,620
victim and the router it sends back a

300
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:46,090
reply with the true data so that the

301
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:53,260
system isn't poisoned it's not made

302
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:57,549
unstable and for the next demo we're

303
00:25:53,260 --> 00:26:02,408
gonna use another tool called better

304
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:02,860
better cup I don't know if you've heard

305
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:05,980
of it

306
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:10,928
it's a tool that you can use to do man

307
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:17,409
in the middle and it's good because it's

308
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:21,190
easy to use allows you to launch tools

309
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:27,309
such as SS strip automatically without

310
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:30,659
having to say so explicitly so it's very

311
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:30,658
it's very easy to use

312
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,779
[Music]

313
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,960
we apologize that the gentleman just

314
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,960
closed his microphone without meaning to

315
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:00,300
what we're going to try to do now is to

316
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:04,270
do the same demo but in this case with

317
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:08,830
HTTP traffic so you'll see that in that

318
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:11,860
case you can't see the data clearly so

319
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:21,159
we can launch the same attackers before

320
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:28,959
the RP spoof attack this is web shock

321
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:33,970
and for those of you that are watching

322
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:38,670
what that green flash says is saying

323
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:42,520
that our traffic between the US and the

324
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:52,170
server the destination server is

325
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:56,190
encrypted so here what we can see is

326
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,190
this is encrypted alert

327
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:06,399
it's loading the login page and here we

328
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:09,310
can see packets that that say

329
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,480
application data so if we try to see

330
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,480
some of them

331
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:23,250
well what she might be able to see

332
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,250
anything here however

333
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:54,669
my keepers for example oh well it's

334
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:58,359
traffic on he found almost not inclined

335
00:28:54,669 --> 00:29:04,959
Vallecano qual siempre que estamos

336
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:08,769
haciendo we're accessing a web or in

337
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:12,899
general we're broadcasting traffic via

338
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:15,299
an encrypted channel so without

339
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:18,639
complicating too much the attack

340
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:21,999
scenario if there are no mistakes with a

341
00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:24,820
certificate then were safe so that's on

342
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:29,529
the client side of things if your admin

343
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:33,519
or or if you depend on this technical

344
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:39,269
side of server setup if we activate the

345
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:43,149
HTTP and HTTPS for all traffic we also

346
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:49,149
gain in privacy both for our services

347
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:51,008
and for any clients that you may have so

348
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:56,168
let's look at the attacker game and now

349
00:29:51,009 --> 00:30:00,159
what you'll see is how we can avoid this

350
00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:01,839
restriction the SSL restriction and

351
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,749
we're not going to do anything new

352
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:08,918
actually we're not going to break the

353
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:11,379
SSL or the TDS nor are we going to

354
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:20,709
decipher traffic but what you will see

355
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:29,259
now is how normally when you get go to a

356
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:31,269
web we don't normally type in HTTP colon

357
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:34,539
slash slash and then the web you just

358
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:40,089
type in the web name and you access it

359
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:42,489
via an HTTP address vamos a ver comma Y

360
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:46,178
is tell for your wallet and see how the

361
00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:48,249
fault and the error appears what's the

362
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:49,719
status of the fault and we realized that

363
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:53,889
this connection has been established

364
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:58,880
without encryption with HTTP when really

365
00:30:53,889 --> 00:31:02,719
it should be HTTPS if we see that we are

366
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,240
connecting to Facebook and it's HTTP if

367
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,930
we realize it something is happening

368
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:13,760
it's strange it's odd it's not going to

369
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:17,660
with HTTPS these are signals and signs

370
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:21,950
that help us identify that something

371
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:25,460
strange is happening as I said let's see

372
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:30,230
the better cap tool with a minus T

373
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:33,110
parameter we say who's our victim one a

374
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,450
hundred this parameter wouldn't be

375
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:38,929
necessary but it's not strictly

376
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:48,770
necessary but we'll use a minus G the

377
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:54,460
Gateway the the link board one one we

378
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:58,100
are going to be a proxy the post

379
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:05,480
requests are going to interest us and

380
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:10,000
the network interface W land zero can

381
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,000
you see the command fine

382
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:29,110
we are in the middle this is the strip

383
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,610
less trip that's that the two in this

384
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:35,949
with this two one way to ask her a

385
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:40,719
request to web sites with HTTP normally

386
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:51,750
what this web does is to redirect us to

387
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:56,200
the HTTPS version 3:01 3:02

388
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:57,490
and that's alice's trip in the due to

389
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,820
the fact that we are in the middle it's

390
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:04,530
going to change all the links to HTTPS

391
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:08,889
and they're going to be replaced by HTTP

392
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:11,500
so as attackers we would be browsing

393
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:15,220
between inverted commas with through

394
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:18,220
HTTP but we given the customer or the

395
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:22,390
client there's tripled the stripped a

396
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:29,770
data we're going to give them back the

397
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:30,670
HTTP version petrol cap is started we

398
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,540
are in the middle

399
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:41,800
we've prepared a domain for this it's

400
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:45,610
the same HTTPS encryption and here we

401
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:53,620
see that this is the strip it's going so

402
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:58,389
stripping HTTP link inside you can't see

403
00:33:53,620 --> 00:34:08,168
Alberto screen but here it's stupid this

404
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:10,240
little green thingy are has is there

405
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:14,609
it's the padlock at the green padlock

406
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,609
and all the traffic goes through HTTP

407
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:25,860
that's all so we return the customer the

408
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:30,540
HTTP version we removed all the HTTP

409
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:33,419
links and if he up said accessed the

410
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:39,179
login page if he had access to the login

411
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:44,219
page we would see the data that this

412
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:46,260
customer is typing in the form we could

413
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:48,629
capture images we're not going to do

414
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:53,669
that now because we've already seen it

415
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:57,110
but now this scenario for the victim is

416
00:34:53,668 --> 00:35:05,009
exactly the same it's HTTP connection

417
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:10,080
and there's nothing else here so there's

418
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:14,270
the typing of this data what is the

419
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:17,520
error here well he doesn't realize that

420
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:22,530
he's accessing through HTTP instead of

421
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:28,259
HTTP so in this this moment he would

422
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:29,730
typed HTTP slash it would be encrypted

423
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,410
we couldn't wouldn't be able to see

424
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:33,410
anything but this is not the case

425
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:51,830
to improve this connections and avoid

426
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:57,810
this scenarios we have etched a HD STS

427
00:35:51,830 --> 00:36:00,150
it comes from HTTP Transport Security

428
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:02,970
and what it says

429
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:06,300
in fact is that we as a client we

430
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:10,649
connect to a network through HTTP that

431
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:16,160
web server returns us a redirection to

432
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:20,670
the HTTPS and it includes a heading

433
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,190
saying from now on and until I don't

434
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:30,390
know how much time you can to connect to

435
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:35,100
myself only through HTTPS the browser

436
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:43,620
keeps that information and even though

437
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:45,779
you type HTTP slash the wrap browser

438
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,120
that has this information and it's going

439
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,270
to turn into HTTPS and the web server

440
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:55,920
will be browsing with HTTPS that's

441
00:36:51,270 --> 00:37:02,040
Google PayPal and other whoops you is

442
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:06,500
that and any error that may appear with

443
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:09,480
a certificate well normally the browser

444
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:12,600
allows you to add an exception yes I

445
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,310
want to access this website with this

446
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,490
type of heavy you cannot add an

447
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:20,520
exception you cannot access through HTTP

448
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:22,890
even if you want to the big sites in

449
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:26,730
internet sites by defects have an

450
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:31,500
agreement and this is included in all

451
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:35,340
browsers but we as not in our part we

452
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:38,460
can also activate it the Apache

453
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:41,000
configuration allows that we include a

454
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,160
couple of lines and we force it once a

455
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,660
person is connected through HTTP the

456
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,910
connection towards our sites for a

457
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:53,029
specific period of time that we define

458
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:53,029
will be through the secure protocol

459
00:37:53,180 --> 00:38:03,690
fine in the next demo we're going to

460
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:13,259
skip this security measure and for this

461
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:18,110
purpose we have two different ways of

462
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:24,390
doing this if my browser well it has a

463
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:27,240
pre-loaded list of sites with HD CCS so

464
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,339
from the first time you start or you

465
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,299
install the browser that information is

466
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:38,430
loaded and can you cannot access through

467
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:40,140
HTTP anymore if that domain specifically

468
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:43,799
the one that we've prepared is not in

469
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:47,160
that pre-loaded list the first time the

470
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,870
he axis says you can go through HTTP but

471
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,700
not the next ones at this the first time

472
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:56,370
you can do with HTTP it's a very

473
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,109
difficult case it's very rare you're

474
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:01,290
going to connect the first time with

475
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:02,940
HTTPS and then you get intercepted but

476
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:07,650
we need to know them the first time

477
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:12,030
might be through HTTP another option is

478
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:15,330
that the customer who cleans the catcher

479
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:18,390
and the browser data and you lose the

480
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:20,279
information and the next time with HTTP

481
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:23,549
he can do it again because he's cleaned

482
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:28,380
the cache but what happens in the case

483
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:31,800
and we can see it here so we have we

484
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,330
have the clean browser cache a so our

485
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,710
browser doesn't know that our

486
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:40,220
destination site as HT CCS activated the

487
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,220
first time

488
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:56,779
here it we get to a sub-domain

489
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:59,780
it's called DeLorean so HTC s trip is

490
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:02,360
acting here it's operating because we in

491
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:05,420
that situation the browser doesn't have

492
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,820
that information for HTTP so it's

493
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:14,710
possible to be connected through HTTP

494
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:17,560
and direct an attack what I'm doing now

495
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:19,700
is to stop it the attack

496
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:23,690
Berta's going to get to the network so

497
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:27,470
that the browser gets the browser gets

498
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:31,580
the HTC's yes so the attack it's not

499
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:40,990
going to work anymore we will stop the

500
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:45,980
attack I'm gonna launch I'm gonna clean

501
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:53,680
this guy IP tables because bitter cup

502
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:53,680
and other tools use this to have a proxy

503
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:03,710
as attackers we're not going to launch

504
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:06,939
this attacks we will launch one or two

505
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:10,580
but not many of them so to clean it up

506
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:13,540
they are IP tables I'm going to clean

507
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:21,069
them these IP tables

508
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:24,620
well I've accessed once in my server as

509
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:28,850
delorean is the web provider I said to

510
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:31,940
the visitors browser that that has to

511
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:35,810
access through the HTTP as always so I

512
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:39,250
can't launch my attack anymore so this

513
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:39,250
is the heading attack

514
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:57,130
the the attack now is launched so it was

515
00:41:52,660 --> 00:42:01,808
the HTTP CSS it's accessing the web and

516
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:09,640
we don't know about it it are now HTTP

517
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:12,210
that has been forced how can we skip

518
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:17,920
this restriction

519
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:21,040
well the HT CTS heading has must a max

520
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,680
eight it's the time what for this

521
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,960
information to expire I don't know if

522
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:39,460
it's two years by the fact Twitter I

523
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:45,299
think it was 30 years how can we skip

524
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:48,400
this restriction the client the victim

525
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:51,670
could be you know later date on a later

526
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,030
date than the one determined by the max

527
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:59,140
six how this case can happen where the

528
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:03,549
customer changes the date of his or her

529
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:07,629
computer and you can you can change the

530
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:12,210
date and many years in advance so it's

531
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:12,210
not spontaneous yeah we can force it

532
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:24,130
will use a tool called DeLorean that was

533
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:31,900
designed by horses salaries security

534
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:34,750
researcher he's here in cyber camp he

535
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:38,380
was making a research on synchronization

536
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:45,700
of dates in the various operating

537
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:49,980
systems and he devised this tool which

538
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:55,058
establishes who sets a server NTP date

539
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:57,780
in your your PC so we are in a scenario

540
00:43:55,059 --> 00:44:00,010
of man-in-the-middle the victim

541
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,420
computers asking for the date what is

542
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:03,670
the current date

543
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:08,020
as we are in the mid in the middle and

544
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:10,900
this servo is intercepted with DeLorean

545
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:14,079
we are at this is the Dayton three years

546
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:20,890
four years later I recommend you to

547
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:23,220
visit tempest dot dot yes and this is

548
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:29,049
interesting so you can have a look at it

549
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:33,669
for this how can we force the fact that

550
00:44:29,049 --> 00:44:41,500
the customer asks for the date well it

551
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:43,569
depends because the windows systems and

552
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:47,609
hoses always reached the conclusion that

553
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:52,058
they synchronize the hour apparently on

554
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:59,319
Sunday during the night yes assume they

555
00:44:52,059 --> 00:45:03,760
Sunday nights so it's not just by chance

556
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:05,380
that we have the opportunity to have

557
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,059
this scenario of this man-in-the-middle

558
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:12,460
scenario until the Sunday night and at

559
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:19,270
this moment at this precise moment the

560
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:22,900
victims computer is on but there's a

561
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:26,829
case of Ubuntu it's installed here

562
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:29,079
Ubuntu and it updates every time it

563
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:34,299
connects to the network if there's a

564
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:38,339
request to be reconnected against the

565
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:45,339
end ttp let's see it

566
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:53,349
you as a user in your Ubuntu screen you

567
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:56,319
only have the hour 10:45 if you connect

568
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:59,589
now so that you can see that request and

569
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:02,160
see the date yes I'm going to connect to

570
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:02,160
his computer

571
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:23,690
here you see the date I don't know if

572
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:30,580
you can really see it now the current

573
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:30,580
date Saturday the 2nd of December 1046

574
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:40,570
so I'm going to disconnect so that

575
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:43,900
there's no problem how can we force this

576
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:46,460
disconnection from the network by chance

577
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:51,440
this is connected in a wireless manner

578
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:54,800
as you know wireless communications like

579
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:59,690
they are as they are I'm going to use a

580
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,550
Wi-Fi external card to push it out of

581
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:07,250
the network and to force them to

582
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:10,360
reconnect in this way there will be a

583
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:16,520
date request we'll give him the date I'm

584
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:17,750
going to change the date and the next

585
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:23,540
time he connects

586
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:26,290
he will connect with HTTP the key here

587
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:30,680
is that he connects without typing

588
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:33,440
specifically the word HTTP in that way

589
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:37,609
we can skip this restriction because it

590
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:40,670
date has been changed here we have the

591
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:49,210
man in the middle scenario I'm going to

592
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:49,210
launch the DeLorean

593
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,150
and here

594
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:06,620
I'm going to but the monitor the manager

595
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,620
mode for the card

596
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:17,220
we with arrow damp air will dumb

597
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,990
- be

598
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:37,390
we'll see here the Wi-Fi networks that

599
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:42,960
are all around ours is this one we

600
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:48,460
stopped it and it's Channel six

601
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:54,520
so I'm going to stop it's with VBA it's

602
00:48:48,460 --> 00:49:06,760
with VBA yes let's start again with the

603
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:11,770
display mode channel 6 let's launch an

604
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:15,490
attack authentication attack with our

605
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:22,950
air play - 0 is the authentication type

606
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:27,419
of attack indefinite the access point

607
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:27,419
various is D is this one

608
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:46,720
and the client or the victim has a MAC

609
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:51,160
address you've caught it somewhere here

610
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:56,649
we take it from here this is it we

611
00:49:51,160 --> 00:50:00,009
obtain it easily with a Rodin we can

612
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:07,859
obtain it when I stopped the RP spoofing

613
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:10,930
attack I got it it's not a mysterious

614
00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:20,590
thing to do and the network interface

615
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:22,419
now wlm through this attack I'm going to

616
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:23,970
force them to push him out of the

617
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:32,830
network

618
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:35,950
DeLorean it's listening here when you

619
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:40,540
get you disconnect tell me because I'll

620
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:44,980
stop the attack sometimes it takes a

621
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:49,509
little while to crush not it's not

622
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:52,630
always an immediate now it's crushed

623
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:55,180
okay it's the network is disconnected I

624
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:57,820
was pushed out of my network and I

625
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:03,790
reconnect my computer and now we are

626
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:06,280
sending the date to its 2021 we pushing

627
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:10,150
forward the date so I'm going to

628
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:12,130
reconnect again in the Ubuntu screen

629
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:14,650
we've seen a micro disconnection from

630
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:17,530
the why fight sometimes it happened and

631
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:20,950
now it's still there we didn't feel a

632
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:23,470
flashing sign there's nothing strange

633
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:31,930
happening in our computer let's go to

634
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:36,910
the calendar it's January 2021 we just

635
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:40,960
changed the date de Lorean attack in

636
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:43,210
fact we won't stop it in case it asks

637
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,320
for the date again and it picks the

638
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:50,500
right one but we realized is that if

639
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:52,960
this computer has the date configuration

640
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:56,910
in manual mode it doesn't work has to

641
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:59,950
had the automatic mode for the date

642
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:02,040
because if it's not if it's manual it's

643
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:04,390
not going to ask the date to any server

644
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:08,440
well it's very strange to have the

645
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:11,848
manual setting for the date now we skip

646
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:15,609
the limit date to maxixe

647
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:20,530
and if he connects again to the same

648
00:52:15,609 --> 00:52:32,290
website website it's going through HTTP

649
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:35,589
now so we can see the traffic DeLorean

650
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:43,630
here you see the attack we are seeing

651
00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:46,390
his traffic so we are escaping this

652
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:51,099
restriction and he it's not secure

653
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:55,118
anymore with H STS it's an effective

654
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:58,810
measure it's not that easy to skip this

655
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:04,740
and we've prepared this scenario so that

656
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:09,720
you can see a concept test but really

657
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:09,720
it's it's an effective measure

658
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:21,830
Moscow has persuade no and Jacques

659
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,540
Thomason and Metallica so we are in the

660
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:31,160
middle of the communication with better

661
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:35,450
cup what we can do is to ask for a DNS

662
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:37,370
file DNS spoofing now with the same

663
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:42,910
scenario we are in the middle of the

664
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:46,279
communication this time when he requests

665
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:49,279
to access a website we're gonna say that

666
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,890
they'd website is an in an IP address

667
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,510
that we control our server controls this

668
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:59,000
I babe and we're not going to tell him

669
00:53:53,510 --> 00:54:07,240
it it's not the original IP it's a to

670
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:07,240
spoof our DNS file let's stop the attack

671
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:17,540
okay the Alerian is stopped can you

672
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:32,030
disconnect so that it gets the the right

673
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:34,600
stage this time mo moany Toro let's stop

674
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:39,770
the screen

675
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:42,680
we switch it off and now the as the

676
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:47,120
display mode is switched off we're going

677
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:53,980
to clean the the IP tables in this case

678
00:54:47,120 --> 00:55:00,350
I don't know if you know the set toolkit

679
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:03,770
through this - it's for social engineer

680
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:10,100
attacks and it's got a function which is

681
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:13,430
to clone a website will have been

682
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:19,640
playing with it a little bit it's quite

683
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:23,540
simple it's not for it's not made for a

684
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:27,259
complex environments in this case I

685
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:31,490
decided to mount to have it exactly the

686
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:32,900
same website in the computer at local

687
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,879
level and when the victim

688
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,760
let's send us a request to that website

689
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,550
I'm saying it's in my computer in fact

690
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,700
and he connects to mine instead of to

691
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:54,340
the original website let's do the

692
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:58,210
service Apache starts and my SQL ok the

693
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:58,210
web server is up

694
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:20,340
so tests are made with a workplace we've

695
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:26,170
just changed the title secure secure or

696
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:31,600
time travel let's use better cup metal

697
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:36,060
cap will say what is the network

698
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:36,060
interface our victim

699
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,960
the Gateway

700
00:56:46,900 --> 00:57:05,950
the attack is the DNS spoofing and the

701
00:56:53,890 --> 00:57:05,950
the file root document DNS fine okay

702
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:12,279
so to see this that this file is

703
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,280
contained here

704
00:57:18,299 --> 00:57:27,279
this are the entries that are in there

705
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:34,000
there my IP address is 102 these domains

706
00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:36,640
correspond to that IP address now we

707
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,720
have better cap that's been launched we

708
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:44,890
didn't activate the sniffing module

709
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:48,129
we're just going to see how it really

710
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:53,470
act and get to a website that is not the

711
00:57:48,130 --> 00:58:01,869
original one and it's this it's the same

712
00:57:53,470 --> 00:58:05,348
cases we've seen before CSV highs astora

713
00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:09,119
and did you know that in the title we've

714
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:13,829
changed the title to either identify it

715
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,829
maybe you can see it the spoofer side

716
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:27,690
the access to look in Apache music we

717
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:32,310
can see this is the last access this is

718
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:35,130
localhost one 100 this is now it's

719
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:38,009
accessing to the website that we put in

720
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:42,360
a local level when you visit this domain

721
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:44,760
we said what is the DNS why and the the

722
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:48,120
victim has gone to our website instead

723
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:51,650
of going to the original website so the

724
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:57,210
scenario here would be exactly the same

725
00:58:51,650 --> 00:59:05,250
if you've accessed the HTTP well we

726
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:07,830
could access HTTP in the same way if the

727
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:10,680
result is the same in this case is

728
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:14,509
accessing a website with HTTPS and you

729
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:20,669
can say okay we can't see the traffic

730
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:22,740
but we have two options either we

731
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:29,610
launched the attack to strip that part

732
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:32,899
of SSL or as we have control of this web

733
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:37,920
server and we're given a certificate to

734
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:39,890
establish the SSL session obviously in

735
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,420
the browser

736
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:44,910
there should be an error in the

737
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:47,610
certificate because it will be self

738
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:51,750
signed in fact it's not signed by a

739
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:55,020
recognized entity recognize the

740
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:57,750
signature in that case we would gave

741
00:59:55,020 --> 01:00:01,259
wayside the private key of this

742
00:59:57,750 --> 01:00:06,210
certificate and it could be it could

743
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:08,940
decrypt the SSL part as long as we have

744
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:13,800
the control of the web server we can

745
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:21,570
decrypt them decrypt and decode the

746
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:24,810
traffic we can have we can replace the

747
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:28,110
website we can compile all the data and

748
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:30,570
collect the data of this people with

749
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:32,100
credentials we could have a database

750
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:41,490
of these credentials for instance in

751
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:44,549
facebook we can do we could hijack and

752
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:47,220
there's a Facebook clone and everybody's

753
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:49,310
leaving the Facebook log and in fact it

754
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:53,700
goes to the database that is fake and

755
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:57,810
it's not Facebook it's it's a fake

756
01:00:53,700 --> 01:01:02,660
facebook you can imagine what this would

757
01:00:57,810 --> 01:01:07,259
mean how could we generate a self-signed

758
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:09,750
certificate and if you look in google

759
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:14,970
you'll find thousands of pages saying

760
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:24,090
how you can do that with HB c CL opens

761
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:29,720
ssl the request option we can ask for

762
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:29,720
the certificate 509 new key

763
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:43,240
it's the file does key I was a fear

764
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:47,550
kilogram assertive Oh

765
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:54,600
so our RSA that's the number of bytes

766
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:59,890
it's not encrypted the Khazar encrypted

767
01:01:54,600 --> 01:02:09,960
we wanted now this in the file that we

768
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:09,960
choose this certificate in itself

769
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:27,450
fine name dot CRT and it would be valid

770
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:32,190
for 365 days we would generate and self

771
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:34,589
signed certificate dot k dot CRT that we

772
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:40,650
can use in the web server and this dot k

773
01:02:34,589 --> 01:02:47,700
key we be given two ways are to decrypt

774
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:50,880
the traffic Mali apart a story ma what

775
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:54,629
can we do apart from this once we are in

776
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:58,950
the middle of the communication it's

777
01:02:54,630 --> 01:03:02,760
just your imagination so let's do

778
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:07,049
another demo I want to is we're going to

779
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:10,020
place a JavaScript into any website that

780
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:12,180
this victim visits and to do that we're

781
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:15,059
going to use Biff I don't know if you've

782
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:19,410
heard of this tool Biff we'll have a

783
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:22,829
look at it now the Biff tool mrs.

784
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:29,308
merriman tacky Siri para I this is a

785
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:32,099
tool to hijack the web browser the

786
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:34,140
victim is going to load the JavaScript

787
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:37,859
they're going to run it and they're

788
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:40,020
going to return to us the connection

789
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:42,000
with their browser so we're going to be

790
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:44,819
able to launch a series of attacks

791
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,559
against her his or her whereby the

792
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:52,500
social engineering attacks or whatever

793
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:56,930
so let's just have a look at it we've

794
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,930
activated this Biff service

795
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:08,240
I'm going to try and do now is say for

796
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:14,259
example it's like the same attack we did

797
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:14,259
before this booth but nah

798
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:37,060
okay well yeah we have the network

799
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:37,060
interface there as before and our victim

800
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:49,620
[Music]

801
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:56,040
in this case were tell gonna tell it not

802
01:04:49,620 --> 01:05:01,799
not to use the SSL strip and we'll set

803
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:05,490
up the proxy and we're gonna say we're

804
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:09,690
going to use a proxy module which is

805
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:10,770
going to be is inject JavaScript I don't

806
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:16,320
if you can see it's at the bottom of the

807
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:24,150
screen here and the URL where this Java

808
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:26,900
scripts located is the local URL this is

809
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:26,900
the IP address

810
01:05:29,859 --> 01:05:44,848
one 102 bought three thousands of stroke

811
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:44,849
hook so you can see how this works

812
01:05:56,569 --> 01:06:02,199
I put some fun

813
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:22,170
Valley Park in a.m. Monday there from

814
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:25,940
feelings how ice cream palette racism

815
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:27,300
poco assume pocket of stencil Mali

816
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:31,740
better one

817
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:35,240
I also have a out on the court ain't on

818
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:37,740
face so what we're gonna do

819
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:40,350
we'll put the man in the middle of the

820
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:43,370
proxy and we're gonna tell it to load

821
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,370
this JavaScript

822
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:03,640
in May 11th and Oh

823
01:07:11,619 --> 01:07:21,130
but okay very soggy yes you can see it

824
01:07:15,309 --> 01:07:28,989
now on the screen Alpana dime is nothing

825
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:33,670
the movies okay beef it's called Molly

826
01:07:28,989 --> 01:07:36,130
Monica variables so there are two

827
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:37,180
directories here we've got the online in

828
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:39,430
the offline

829
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:41,618
here you can see where we've been

830
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:48,549
carrying out trial now they're online

831
01:07:41,619 --> 01:07:57,489
and here you can see those that are

832
01:07:48,549 --> 01:08:03,130
currently hooked see if at this moment

833
01:07:57,489 --> 01:08:07,839
in time the victim access is a web we

834
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:11,680
should be able to see how this

835
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:13,769
JavaScript's injected there you can see

836
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,769
it

837
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:25,830
and if everything's gone okay here in

838
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:28,830
beef you can see how this this browse

839
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:35,519
has now been hijacked there are all

840
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:37,290
kinds of data here for example the

841
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:42,380
browse the D is the language that it

842
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:42,380
uses the platform you can see whether

843
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:55,649
what what plugins it has and what can we

844
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:59,370
do we can launch several launch several

845
01:08:55,649 --> 01:09:04,170
commands for example we can launch

846
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:08,880
commands to detect if see if there's any

847
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:10,620
of these plugins or maybe to see the

848
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,560
person's webcam has that person got a

849
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:17,488
webcam you can if you can see the green

850
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:18,779
dot what that means that this is that

851
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:21,660
this attack is probably going to be

852
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:23,460
successful and if it's red it's probably

853
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:30,500
going to fail or you can't launch the

854
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:39,120
attack and just to give you an example I

855
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:43,049
think if we go to exploit here and you

856
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:53,399
can see I mean we can launch all sorts

857
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:55,759
of things social engineering this one

858
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:55,759
here

859
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:06,659
what this is going to do is it's going

860
01:09:59,409 --> 01:10:14,348
to send a window a pop-up window near

861
01:10:06,659 --> 01:10:16,210
the browser asking for your credentials

862
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:17,320
as if you your facebook session had

863
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:22,510
finished and they're gonna ask you to

864
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:24,790
reopen it so that's the kind of attack

865
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:28,500
that we could do I don't know if you can

866
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:28,500
see this clearly on the screen

867
01:10:28,739 --> 01:10:38,379
yeah it's to load any sort of local that

868
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:41,138
we want to load I'm not going to ask any

869
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:48,909
for the moment so if we launch this

870
01:10:41,139 --> 01:10:52,830
attack here in the victims browser a pop

871
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:57,809
ups opened in which they asked for their

872
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:57,809
username and password for facebook

873
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:18,210
already homes

874
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:24,750
Molly Aguilar I wash there you can see

875
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:29,790
it that I've typed in username and

876
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:31,920
password and we can also carry out more

877
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:40,940
attacks for example there are some

878
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:40,940
attacks where you see on the web browser

879
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:49,110
a blog with a banner which says mmm

880
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:56,100
install flash again and what they'll do

881
01:11:49,110 --> 01:12:06,380
is it'll put a payload in or anything

882
01:11:56,100 --> 01:12:12,420
else what can we conclude from this

883
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:13,020
in general the protection measures that

884
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:16,710
exist

885
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:20,910
HT TS can be considered safe and

886
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:24,240
effective always the biggest mistake a

887
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:27,090
human factor of course we don't realize

888
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:30,860
as humans that actually were accessing

889
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:35,820
via HTTP that's my personal opinion any

890
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:45,000
web should you should access by default

891
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:48,210
HTTP unless we've seen how you can be

892
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:54,840
attacked if you don't type HTTP colon

893
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:56,910
slash slash and it's difficult because

894
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:00,320
if there's a certification error you

895
01:12:56,910 --> 01:13:04,470
won't be able to access the web so in

896
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,790
production environments you you don't

897
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:09,300
want your clients or for whatever

898
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:12,740
meeting you don't want this so many

899
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,740
clouds to have this service that's why

900
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:20,820
we're frightened of doing this but it's

901
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:22,920
an effective measure I know they're all

902
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:30,660
just little things but they're little

903
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:32,580
layers that we add if you remove the

904
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:34,349
wireless connection of your of your

905
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:39,540
terminal because you're not using it at

906
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:47,190
that time don't connect to open wireless

907
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:50,580
is by default don't try to use a safe

908
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:53,239
sites whenever you're using your device

909
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:57,720
especially when you're accessing your

910
01:13:53,239 --> 01:14:01,410
blogs your cloud your banking account

911
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:06,120
and returning to this case with which we

912
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:08,790
started to the workshop were it was you

913
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:10,830
in a public place like a hotel where you

914
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:17,430
can get free wireless if you're going to

915
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:24,300
use it we recommend you use a VPN or an

916
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:28,350
ssh connection and then access internet

917
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:29,670
after having activated your VPN because

918
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:34,140
then the network that you're connected

919
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:36,090
to isn't able to decipher traffic do you

920
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:38,489
know what a VPN software is there's

921
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:42,920
anybody in the room not know what VPN

922
01:14:38,489 --> 01:14:47,280
software is doubly important for that

923
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:49,770
you know we recommend it 100% if you are

924
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:55,309
away from home if you have to use lots

925
01:14:49,770 --> 01:15:01,020
of hotels he activates your VPN network

926
01:14:55,310 --> 01:15:03,180
if you can get a VPN network it's an

927
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:08,460
another another layer of security which

928
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:13,680
we add to you know navigate or browse a

929
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:17,550
little more safety normally with these

930
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:20,520
kind of attacks what they'll usually

931
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:24,500
steal is your username or password or

932
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:29,740
things that can harm but

933
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:32,210
humm to a certain extent but imagine

934
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:34,250
that they don't just get there you're

935
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:38,480
using a password but more other data

936
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:43,010
personal data in that sense you've got a

937
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:46,309
a more hardcore scenario because with

938
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:50,390
just a relatively few personal data you

939
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:55,190
can actually prepare an attack a fairly

940
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:57,320
powerful attack and and also one day T

941
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:59,210
it takes you to the next one so you just

942
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,150
get you plant one little seed you you

943
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:05,840
you pull the thread and in the end you

944
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:09,589
can collect all kinds of data from that

945
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,720
person we're talking here about a person

946
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:18,680
of course you know that's how we focused

947
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:22,970
this but imagine an attack in which they

948
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:26,000
get personal information about you they

949
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:29,840
can access your personal accounts they

950
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:36,680
can carry out identity theft at the very

951
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:40,270
least it's easy just to get your email

952
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:42,530
you can find that person in Google

953
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:49,820
they've already got a Facebook profile

954
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:55,040
and 70% share it publicly with all the

955
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:55,910
photos so you can get the photos you

956
01:16:55,040 --> 01:17:00,410
know what they cause you know where they

957
01:16:55,910 --> 01:17:02,360
live you've got all their data so you

958
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:06,880
get a Facebook profile with all their

959
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:08,599
data and from then onwards wherever the

960
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:14,960
imagination will take you in whatever

961
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:16,370
your fancy doing having reached this

962
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,980
point people are gonna do I'm gonna do

963
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:25,720
things for good I don't if you know the

964
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:25,719
case of Sandra Bridge Sandra prints

965
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:39,719
was a u.s. lady and she was a drug

966
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:43,740
consume identity was in a drug dealer as

967
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:50,940
well but she was arrested and what they

968
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:54,269
did they took her smartphone they

969
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:58,500
accessed her personal data they took a

970
01:17:54,270 --> 01:18:03,900
photo and instead of a Facebook page

971
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:06,690
with these photos to attract other

972
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:09,719
dealers and in that way tried to trap

973
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:11,910
them in fact that's what happened they

974
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:14,940
managed to get hold of quite a few drug

975
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:18,660
traffickers so what I'm saying with this

976
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:20,960
is that personal data are data and

977
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:30,510
they're personal they're very valuable

978
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:32,550
and a very powerful attack can be

979
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:34,650
committed with just some limited

980
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:36,360
personal data not just hacking at all

981
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:39,269
but just a public information that's on

982
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:43,950
the Internet and another of the

983
01:18:39,270 --> 01:18:48,900
workshops that we've attended over the

984
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:50,849
last few days somebody told me a recent

985
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:55,620
case of just a few months ago when a

986
01:18:50,850 --> 01:19:00,240
national company because of its purchase

987
01:18:55,620 --> 01:19:03,330
volume orders an amount of material from

988
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:06,750
an international company and decides

989
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:09,900
they're gonna pay from a Panama accounts

990
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:12,450
that counts they make an older valued in

991
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:14,670
about 400,000 or 500,000 euros and

992
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:16,889
everything that was a little bit suspect

993
01:19:14,670 --> 01:19:20,460
was a third they said that on this

994
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:26,220
occasion that the amount should be paid

995
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:28,350
into an account in Argentina and so from

996
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:33,900
a certain amount over and above a

997
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:36,210
certain amount the multinational has to

998
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:38,190
pay to an Argentinean counts and the

999
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:40,239
financial manager says that if the

1000
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:43,999
multinational

1001
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:46,669
has those rules and regulations okay

1002
01:19:43,999 --> 01:19:50,389
well we'll make the payment there and

1003
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:54,380
then two weeks later the only thing that

1004
01:19:50,389 --> 01:19:55,670
they know is the account number where

1005
01:19:54,380 --> 01:20:03,880
they've paid the money nobody knows

1006
01:19:55,670 --> 01:20:07,869
where the material is the multinational

1007
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:11,479
it's pending payment to actually send

1008
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:13,429
the material the national company is

1009
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:14,539
waiting for the material to be delivered

1010
01:20:13,429 --> 01:20:17,030
which they're not gonna get because

1011
01:20:14,539 --> 01:20:22,969
they've paid for it and the customers of

1012
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:23,900
the national company going to the

1013
01:20:22,969 --> 01:20:26,300
competitors because they haven't

1014
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:29,869
received their delivery and you can

1015
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:31,249
imagine what all sorts of investigations

1016
01:20:29,869 --> 01:20:33,978
complaints and what's happened quite

1017
01:20:31,249 --> 01:20:40,459
probably this is somebody that's got an

1018
01:20:33,979 --> 01:20:42,800
access to their internal network that

1019
01:20:40,459 --> 01:20:44,239
it's got the information just before the

1020
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:49,880
transaction was carried out and knows

1021
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:55,489
how the company operates so this is just

1022
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:59,389
due to a human failing somebody's access

1023
01:20:55,489 --> 01:21:02,449
that information so we've got a little

1024
01:20:59,389 --> 01:21:04,429
bit of time left over you've got any

1025
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:07,219
questions does anybody want to ask any

1026
01:21:04,429 --> 01:21:08,929
questions it's sorry we can't hear the

1027
01:21:07,219 --> 01:21:13,610
questions from up because the persons

1028
01:21:08,929 --> 01:21:17,380
not using the mic so we'll interpret the

1029
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:17,380
answer if we hear the answer

1030
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:37,400
este tip better gotta maintain a own

1031
01:21:34,940 --> 01:21:40,190
para Metro menos de Mayu schooler para

1032
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:43,909
there's another parameter which is -

1033
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:45,530
mini D when you launch it it emitted

1034
01:21:43,909 --> 01:21:51,049
gives you information about what it's

1035
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:53,420
doing because when we launched all these

1036
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:57,199
attacks we saw how useful it was to see

1037
01:21:53,420 --> 01:22:00,730
how to do things properly actually it's

1038
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:05,928
quite interesting because the first

1039
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:10,449
worked these kind of demos you know you

1040
01:22:05,929 --> 01:22:10,449
can't do overnight you need to test it

1041
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:38,320
there are other questions does anybody

1042
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:38,660
else have any other questions thank you

1043
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:46,840
so much

1044
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:46,840
