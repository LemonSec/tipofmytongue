1
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:24,330
when I started this at the Lowe's

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:26,910
good evening and I hope that you can

3
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,229
hear me because I know that I speak

4
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:34,739
quite low and I hope you can hear me

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,769
with this microphone amusing in spite of

6
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:42,720
the time I know you're all tied but

7
00:00:37,769 --> 00:00:45,629
let's try and tell you about the Rose

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,180
roll that mathematics are plays in

9
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,769
cryptography and to tell you that

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,690
they're essential that they've played an

11
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:54,059
essential role a very important role and

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,559
that they can keep on playing a role

13
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:03,330
much more so than up till now also try

14
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:06,530
and see some of the lines of our seem to

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:12,630
be more promising and where mathematics

16
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:16,110
can help in cryptography and I'm sure

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,710
that we're all convinced of the fact

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,770
that cryptography is an essential pillar

19
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,969
of cyber security because that pays

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,548
plays a very important role in security

21
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:32,820
and it's not just based in cryptography

22
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,659
but it couldn't exist without it and in

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:40,548
cryptography mathematics have played a

24
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:43,649
role that has surprised even

25
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,719
mathematicians I have here a sentence

26
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,530
quote by kibbutz

27
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:52,350
where speaks about how useful

28
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,460
mathematics are in physics and in nature

29
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,490
science

30
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,720
and I hope you'll agree Caesar says that

31
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,660
a huge usefulness of mathematics in

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,210
security of information is the border of

33
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,359
mystery and there's no rational

34
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,820
explanation for it and before we speak

35
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,620
about the role of mathematics in

36
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,760
cryptography I'd like to briefly go over

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,690
something and I'm going to do this very

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,250
quickly about these history of

39
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,200
cryptography because there's not

40
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,260
something they started being applied a

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,410
few years ago the rather they started

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,630
several centuries before Christ even

43
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:38,829
though we must say that at the very

44
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:41,730
beginning it was more of an art more

45
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:45,070
than more so than science and in the

46
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:47,170
Spanish language the dictionary when we

47
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:51,190
look for the definition of cryptography

48
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:55,660
says the art of writing with a private

49
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:59,109
password or with an enigmatic or in an

50
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,140
enigmatic and mysterious way where are

51
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,799
the first examples of a cryptography I'm

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:10,260
sure you've all heard about it say using

53
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:14,100
Sparta and Persia in several ceremonies

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:18,250
what they did was to write on a

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:21,910
parchment and when the parchment was

56
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,540
rolled up it was called a CT Allah so

57
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,760
psyched Allah well and

58
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,450
[Music]

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,048
on rolling it you could see the letters

60
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:36,798
and when the message reached it's a

61
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:40,340
recipient the recipient had to have the

62
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,379
same sort of a stick in order to roll up

63
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:45,310
the parchment and recover the message

64
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:48,620
and retrieve the message another sort of

65
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,909
encryption we all know of is the famous

66
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:56,299
as Caesar's encryption or encrypting

67
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:59,870
where he substitutes a letter whether

68
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:03,680
letter that two layer two letters ahead

69
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:06,760
in the alphabet and in these

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,709
replacements we have the where the

71
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,668
encryption and a special disk was

72
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:16,238
designed for this disc that I'm sure

73
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:19,070
kids have been able to see in

74
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,669
cryptography workshops this morning so

75
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:28,880
therefore in cryptography this wish for

76
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:31,010
security has been present and all of

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:39,469
them have something in common

78
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:42,680
they today private key cryptography so

79
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:47,000
people that want to communicate they

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,760
agree on a key to encrypt the messages

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,849
and communicate they use different

82
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,990
techniques even though this might seem

83
00:04:52,849 --> 00:05:01,010
to be rather based on ingenious but

84
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:06,800
there's always a mathematical operation

85
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:14,680
behind but as we see they do not use

86
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:17,599
deep or serious maths in private key and

87
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,349
didn't that we used today they use a

88
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:25,310
different type of mathematics but not at

89
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:30,380
the level we wish to reach at present

90
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:34,409
they use a flow encrypting or block

91
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:38,249
encrypting and behind all of them there

92
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:44,159
mathematic operations but in fact what

93
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:47,999
was a milestone and change cryptography

94
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:53,580
was the calming of public key

95
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:58,739
cryptography this is recent as in 1976

96
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:02,039
as I said the tog Rafi was always on

97
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:06,539
private key and they used was for

98
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:09,300
diplomatic or military purposes military

99
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:13,919
secrets or state secrets were protected

100
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:17,459
as I said the essential idea was that

101
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:21,209
the same key had to be shared in order

102
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:24,959
to do so both persons had to meet or

103
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:28,379
they should both access the king the

104
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:31,439
fact of getting under key that had to be

105
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:34,610
communicated was always a tricky point

106
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,559
the fact of intercepting it my had fatal

107
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:45,419
conditions as in Maria's Tardos case

108
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:49,829
that she could be beheaded we see the

109
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:55,308
public cryptography this is the problem

110
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:58,499
that we try to avoid to have the key

111
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:59,759
exchange and no longer be a problem and

112
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:04,949
for it to be able to set through a

113
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:07,619
public channel this pioneer work with

114
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:10,169
this new ideas launched a new idea that

115
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:13,519
breaks away with a previous one because

116
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:23,188
right now the encryption and decryption

117
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:26,489
keys are the same well and but there's

118
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:29,759
the same level of difficulty so what

119
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:35,489
they propose in their work is that each

120
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:40,019
user will have two different passwords

121
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:41,760
or keys one for encrypting and the other

122
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,370
one for

123
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:49,500
[Music]

124
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:52,050
this encrypt but the what the password

125
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,070
or key they use to encrypt them must be

126
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:59,760
a key or password that only he or she

127
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,550
knows so that anybody who can see the

128
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:07,110
messages that are encrypted will not be

129
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:10,560
able to read them or see them so this in

130
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:14,850
principle is shocking how can one do

131
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:19,530
something in such a way that everybody

132
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:27,090
can know how to encrypt and not know how

133
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:30,710
to encrypt it so or decipher it so there

134
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:34,610
are what we call one-way functions

135
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:38,309
function we're given element we can

136
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:41,520
estimate or calculate the image of an

137
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:44,550
element and birch on the other hand or

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:48,240
the other will run if I know element

139
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:51,089
which I know is the image of the

140
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,770
function another I have to find great

141
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:58,220
difficulties in order to be able to

142
00:08:52,770 --> 00:09:08,010
estimate the element it is an image of

143
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:12,570
so so when we see this work we they

144
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:17,600
thought about using without using what

145
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,600
could be more appropriate

146
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:33,020
here we use a problem that

147
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:39,220
mathematicians call a discrete logarithm

148
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:46,610
problem because I don't know where the

149
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:49,970
logarithms are still being taught but if

150
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:55,610
the same idea them with logarithms in a

151
00:09:49,970 --> 00:10:00,980
discrete environment so here we have a

152
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:03,980
cyclic group operation and here with one

153
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,649
element we can generate everything we

154
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,149
have an element generated by the group

155
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:14,510
and the rest of the elements that are

156
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:29,390
obtained by multiplying playing G by

157
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:36,790
itself so here we choose a finite group

158
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:42,050
and what and here a select randomly an

159
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:43,839
exponent from exponent a and they don't

160
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,459
tell anybody who it is where they

161
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:56,630
calculate the power and D receives this

162
00:10:49,459 --> 00:11:00,319
power and selects randomly B exponent

163
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:07,390
calculates the power and sensitive a so

164
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:11,779
that a once has received the g bi

165
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:16,550
obtains an element that B can also

166
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:22,970
obtain by doing the operation in the

167
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:26,500
inverse or reverse a manner because

168
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,500
powers work

169
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:42,220
where the numbers G so was the key

170
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:44,360
we need this problem to be complex

171
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,970
enough so that I have some buddies of

172
00:11:44,360 --> 00:12:01,280
watching a network what does he see he

173
00:11:46,970 --> 00:12:09,350
sees these GA element we have a problem

174
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:12,430
of the discrete logarithm if no G it

175
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:17,290
should be able to determine a this is a

176
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,290
problem of the discrete logarithm

177
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:37,700
there's multiplication number of a

178
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:43,270
finite element in mathematics we use the

179
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:46,370
two element body but we have finite

180
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:49,970
bodies with any element that's the power

181
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:51,920
of a prime number and body's weight no

182
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,740
longer have an operation we have to the

183
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,199
addition and the product we can add we

184
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,120
can multiply and we remove the zero

185
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:04,730
that's opposed the product because any

186
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:09,170
element multiplied by zero will result

187
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:10,910
in zero so without a zero this forms a

188
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:14,780
cyclic element with the multiplication

189
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:17,030
and every choose a very large prime it's

190
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,540
very difficult to solve the discrete

191
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:24,079
logarithm in this group so this was one

192
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:30,069
of the major problems we find that were

193
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:33,340
used and after seeing this a few

194
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:36,970
sometime later he come out

195
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:43,960
Pro proposed a system which is based on

196
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:51,310
the list read logarithm two years later

197
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:56,890
after this proposal there's something

198
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:59,500
used another problem and now we're going

199
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:04,900
to formulate it in the easiest possible

200
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:09,330
way the factorization of large numbers

201
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:14,680
so the authors of the famous as as a

202
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:20,050
decided to apply the scheme defined by

203
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:22,449
Hellman using the factoring of very

204
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:27,010
large number so they use this scheme and

205
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:32,230
what does this consist of whoever will

206
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:34,990
design the keyword with a slight trick a

207
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:41,770
very large number is built but as a

208
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:44,700
product after large primes so this

209
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,699
allows

210
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:56,969
when we want to calculate the function

211
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:01,050
of an N number we have to count the

212
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:04,530
numbers smaller than n and that's our n

213
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,020
prime and the way to define it is very

214
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,120
easy but if we think of a number like a

215
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,180
hundred of a hundred and twenty eight

216
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,550
the digits are thinking about counting

217
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:17,400
all the numbers that are smaller would

218
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:21,420
take a centuries it's impossible to do

219
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:25,110
it not even with computers so this is

220
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:32,449
something that is difficult to you know

221
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:32,450
if we don't have the factoring of number

222
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:52,650
so when you have all this information

223
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:54,270
you choose an exponent apart from all

224
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,240
the things that have been added in order

225
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,189
to insure security but in order for the

226
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:04,730
system to make sense it's going to be a

227
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:08,160
relatively prime what this R value we

228
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:14,730
there why do we need this because we

229
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:18,540
know we have two full numbers and we

230
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:21,000
calculate its maximum common divisor

231
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,900
this is related to the numbers too which

232
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,880
is a maximum common divisor through an

233
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,270
identity and what it says is that this

234
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,700
can be expressed as a linear combination

235
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,720
of these two are numbers in this case

236
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:42,840
and so we know that E is relatively

237
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:46,260
prime where I am we may find another D

238
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:49,860
element that states that the product of

239
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:54,860
Hebe times d is 1 plus a multiple or

240
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,860
multiple of 5 en

241
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:02,630
that means that this D value has to be

242
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:08,880
maintained secret because it will

243
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:18,420
prevent anybody else from decrypting it

244
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:22,620
so so here we show the experiment we've

245
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:26,429
selected and as a private key we have to

246
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:32,370
maintain this D that meets this

247
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:34,600
condition we maintain secrecy and the T

248
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,979
Prime

249
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,770
[Music]

250
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:51,690
but if we know the two prime ones when

251
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:59,790
other D so know crypting crypting and

252
00:17:51,690 --> 00:18:02,280
decrypting is easy if we want to have a

253
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:04,220
text and translated into a number the

254
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,500
decks are represented by a number

255
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:12,809
smaller than the module and we calculate

256
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:15,510
the e part of this text module and so

257
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:17,340
the person who is intercepting this and

258
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,450
doesn't know D doesn't know how to

259
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:24,480
retrieve the X starting from its e power

260
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,280
some for us it's easy because what we

261
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,160
need to do is to elevate this to the

262
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:38,059
other exponent that we have a secret and

263
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:41,100
we retrieve the original one is the CIO

264
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:43,050
poor tanto Sherpa and then they maintain

265
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,360
so surprisingly

266
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:51,419
but of the part of the mathematics and

267
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,909
the theory of numbers there were some

268
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:59,309
mathematicians they said that the beauty

269
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:01,679
of the numbers had based on its use

270
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:07,300
uselessness this was basically in order

271
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:10,300
to define define the first scheme

272
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:15,570
piranha plant they are say the chewy

273
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:20,399
professional and so in case somebody

274
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:23,919
people never is it so easy difficulty

275
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,880
factorize a big number because there is

276
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:31,720
also very simple we've all heard about

277
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,880
the screening of prime numbers I can

278
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,100
start calculating to see if it's a

279
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,470
divider or not but the problem has to do

280
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:42,280
with the size of the number with which I

281
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:44,500
want to try the dividers so here I've

282
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:51,850
included a reference to thermo number

283
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:54,190
numbers these numbers numbers that the

284
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:57,250
exponents of exponents were very

285
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:59,260
difficult to write so and we used

286
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,510
mathematicians in the programs with

287
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,060
which we write the mathematical programs

288
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:09,940
even though they are compiled later CDN

289
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:17,080
is 2 a 2 and + or 1 the exponent of 2 is

290
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:23,410
2 elevated at 9 and this is number so I

291
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:32,879
have 0 would be 2 - 0 - at 1 + 1 3 F 1

292
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:43,450
would be 5 F to become 17 F 3 257 at 416

293
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:48,130
4537 numbers keep growing so much and

294
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:50,619
I'm sure you this rings a bell he is one

295
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:56,419
of the best-known

296
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:58,728
persons in mathematics where this famous

297
00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:00,259
theory theorem he thought that the

298
00:20:58,729 --> 00:21:06,830
numbers are chief like this overall

299
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:09,919
prime he didn't give much proof of this

300
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:12,589
because the first five were prime

301
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,849
numbers he knew so he said that all

302
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:21,349
numbers would be prime numbers so when

303
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:28,369
we calculated five as you can see this

304
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:31,158
is ten digit number figure so illa one

305
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:36,589
of the most brilliant mathematician in

306
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:39,349
history factorized it as 641 was one of

307
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:42,529
our first primary dividers he could

308
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:47,450
think of and he said it was a factor of

309
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:51,369
the number but long time elapsed until

310
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:55,039
we could say what happened with the next

311
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:58,488
certain numbers so f6f for instance that

312
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:01,249
appears here on the screen is a figure

313
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:02,559
with one two three four five six at 20

314
00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:05,749
digits

315
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,749
it was factoring as a product of two

316
00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:11,839
prime numbers one with six digits and

317
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:15,469
the other one with 14 but f7 for

318
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:20,629
instance that's called 39 digits was

319
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:23,719
factorized in 1970 so nothing yesterday

320
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:25,820
every competitor with martin numbers

321
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:30,049
when they were suggested by their math

322
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:32,509
and this factorizing i was done by using

323
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:35,809
computers and a sophisticated algorithm

324
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:37,969
in order to simplify factory arising

325
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:42,979
from they're not always are working with

326
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:45,919
powerful computers we could factorize f8

327
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:47,809
which is a figure that's got 78 digits

328
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,019
and factorized as a product of two

329
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:55,639
primes one which is one with 16 digits

330
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:58,519
and the other 32 or f9 number 150 fifty

331
00:22:55,639 --> 00:23:00,889
five digits that keeps on the number of

332
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,810
they just keep multiplying

333
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,510
as factorized as the product of two

334
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:08,899
primes one of them is 49 and the other

335
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:14,270
91 so we come to that indeed factorizing

336
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:16,130
larger numbers is a problem luck cannot

337
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,740
be easily treated but from a

338
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,330
computational standpoint it takes a long

339
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,300
time not that we don't know how to wit

340
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:27,320
do it but it just takes her too long to

341
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:29,750
do it and even with a with the help of a

342
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,760
powerful computer that will simplify

343
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:38,980
things if the figure is large enough

344
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:42,680
well as I said earlier the other

345
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:47,410
original scheme that came up at the same

346
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:51,990
time is the MAL that uses discrete

347
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:54,130
logarithm in the initial version of the

348
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:58,130
[Music]

349
00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:02,200
C we see that there's a group that's

350
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:09,950
been developed that comes from the

351
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:11,930
algebraic discipline and this is a

352
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:17,000
number that allows us to use a smaller

353
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:21,650
Keys so the encryption the processes are

354
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,230
much easier so this is so we've see the

355
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,780
gamal scheme that's been developed with

356
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:30,380
an elliptical curve through what is

357
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:33,560
called a lexical cryptography the

358
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:37,340
beginning I said that cryptography is

359
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:42,879
basic for security a why well why did I

360
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:47,919
say this because just to illustrate how

361
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:53,090
it underlies or security problems and

362
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:54,910
for instance we may go into an HTTPS and

363
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:59,090
we want to communicate with a server

364
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:01,190
every time we do this and I'm sure that

365
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:04,850
this is something that has done millions

366
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:06,550
of times a day we use cryptography well

367
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,370
because the

368
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:11,889
the server and the user that are

369
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,439
communicated do so because they share a

370
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:17,590
key and as soon as they get in touch

371
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:21,690
they start using the computer that the

372
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:26,290
user is using and they start using this

373
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:30,390
algorithm and so these two people that

374
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:33,370
are communicating same key and they

375
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:35,590
encrypt messages so they sent them

376
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,360
encrypted even though you they don't

377
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:41,320
know because this is something that the

378
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,629
users computer does with us other but on

379
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,909
the other hand the server must be sure

380
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,070
that he is actually communicating with a

381
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:50,890
server or not and not with somebody who

382
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:53,740
pretends to be the server and this is

383
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:57,010
something we can do with crypto graphics

384
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,170
and encrypting code that generates a

385
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:02,110
label for instance and when their user

386
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:04,360
receives that label this computer checks

387
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,929
that this corresponds to the key he or

388
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,399
she has for authentication and therefore

389
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:13,600
this means that it must have been the

390
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:18,640
server that sent it so thus we are sure

391
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:22,510
that they can communicate an reliable

392
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:25,360
secure way and we can also use public

393
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:27,490
password or key cryptography in this

394
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,240
sort of communication first of all the

395
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:33,970
user may download this public key from

396
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:39,250
the server and then use this public

397
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:41,710
password in order to encrypt his own and

398
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,800
from there not communicate through

399
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:52,420
symmetric cryptography because it is

400
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:54,820
much faster and in this case you know in

401
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:57,280
order to ensure and make sure that it is

402
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,860
the server that's are sending it they

403
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,170
use digital signature so the server

404
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:06,300
sends the message encrypted with this

405
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:10,860
digital signature with some

406
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:12,930
trusted identity and this is really

407
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,459
important in everything we do every day

408
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:19,140
for instance every time we update a

409
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:23,370
computer software if our computer wasn't

410
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:26,610
sure that this update of dating has been

411
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:29,040
sent by the programs our program we

412
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:32,760
could instill a pirate programmer

413
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,860
instead of an update that could destroy

414
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,800
everything we have in it so therefore

415
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:40,020
the type of processors raw processes

416
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,290
it's essential to have a cryptography

417
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,150
and obviously an having looking for

418
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,190
security bear in mind that absolute

419
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,180
security doesn't exist that is a

420
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:55,290
cryptography is constantly erased trying

421
00:27:51,180 --> 00:28:01,100
to do safe schemes in order for others

422
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:05,670
to look for vulnerabilities and as but

423
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:07,350
the perfect scheme doesn't exist we're

424
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:11,280
not going to be able to find one that

425
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:13,560
will be able to withstand anything so

426
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,660
apart from these two problems that we've

427
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,450
mentioned and that have been used in

428
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:27,320
their cryptography there is another one

429
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:31,590
apart from the famous is a logarithm and

430
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:34,080
elliptical curves this gives rise to you

431
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:37,409
the cryptography of elliptical curves

432
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:41,159
that is used in ninety codes where you

433
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:43,560
see the identity of the person and he or

434
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:50,610
she can even sign documents with it so

435
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:52,620
here I've selected for following some

436
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:55,800
your ideas and I wouldn't to tell you

437
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:58,949
that this is likely different from what

438
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:02,250
I've been telling you of so far we have

439
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:05,940
the hash cryptographic functions a hash

440
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:10,309
function or a summary

441
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:17,390
function is a function that associates

442
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:20,190
arbitrary longitude with fixed M length

443
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:24,360
but in order for hash function to be

444
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:27,450
used for cryptography there are certain

445
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,379
requirements we cannot use just any hash

446
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,200
functions

447
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,260
there's requirements about efficiency

448
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,610
there's got to be efficient

449
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:39,929
implementations that will allow us to

450
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:43,889
estimate the image of an arbitrary

451
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:48,900
length image I know there's going to be

452
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:51,630
all the other safety security conditions

453
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:56,130
must be met one is called

454
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:59,450
a resistance to collisions resistance to

455
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:03,360
the second other image or resistance to

456
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:08,730
target collision and they are very close

457
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:12,539
we can try and define them superficially

458
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:14,640
a resistance to collisions means that it

459
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,470
will not be impossible to you find that

460
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,419
two elements that will have the same

461
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:20,419
image according to the hash function

462
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:28,049
there we know the summary of our

463
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,799
sequence there there as far as not to be

464
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:37,700
possible for us not to be able to

465
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:40,679
estimate the sequence it is a summary of

466
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:42,720
what must be difficult for us is the

467
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,760
following if we are given an element

468
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:50,159
which I'd know here is the hash of

469
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,780
somebody 1 and whose hash it is and to

470
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,500
be able to find another element that

471
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:58,379
will have the same summary function and

472
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,960
resistance to objective collision if we

473
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,870
select a specific target it would be

474
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,250
wouldn't be difficult to find another

475
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:11,399
element with the same image based on the

476
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:14,879
hash function that we specified

477
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:18,899
it must be said that currently there are

478
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:22,199
no families of hash functions that are

479
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:25,379
at the same time efficient and secure

480
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,779
and this security can be duly

481
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:30,869
demonstrated with what mathematicians

482
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:32,940
consider a true demonstration of

483
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:34,649
security that it can be demonstrated or

484
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,649
approved with a series of steps and

485
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:41,609
using specific tools what happens

486
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:43,228
problem is that some work and it seems

487
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:45,199
that they work because they're able to

488
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:48,450
resist the attacks that they are

489
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,919
constantly receiving from cryptographers

490
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,249
so we understand that they are

491
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,659
reasonably secure I mean the security

492
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:57,419
cannot be demonstrated but they are

493
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:00,469
recently secured for a long time sure

494
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:04,830
one was used but then collisions were

495
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:09,559
identified and this and dangerous

496
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:14,399
security but the fact that one has been

497
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:18,749
identified doesn't disabled but calls

498
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,849
for of course examination whenever

499
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:23,609
there's a hash function that is

500
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:25,950
compromised them and this is something

501
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:29,149
that happened with sha-1 a collision was

502
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:32,519
detected and there are procedures that

503
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:35,570
sometimes obliges to lose some efficacy

504
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,099
because they complicate the process but

505
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:41,939
contribute to their resilience or

506
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:44,218
resistance so there are hash functions

507
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,259
that are apparently safe and secure and

508
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:52,099
that can be used for cryptographic

509
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:55,710
purposes in order to use these functions

510
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:58,918
the only security parameter we have is

511
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:02,460
the length of the summary that we

512
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:06,899
associate to a random arbitrary chain

513
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:09,119
and that's an example if we think about

514
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:11,758
an attack that can be perpetrated to

515
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,738
whatever hash functions using the

516
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,690
birthday paradox and I don't know if

517
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:18,960
you're aware of the birthday paradox is

518
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:21,719
simply if we ask ourselves how many

519
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,729
people are there in a room or should

520
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:27,749
there be a tomb for their likely in

521
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:31,049
their selves two of them having the same

522
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:34,739
birthday being at least 0.5 well the

523
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:37,710
answer is much lower than one what might

524
00:33:34,739 --> 00:33:39,359
expect 23 people whenever there's 33

525
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:43,109
people the probability of having two

526
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:45,178
having the same birthday is 1/2 if there

527
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:48,299
are 90 people in a room

528
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:51,749
sorry 50 people in the room you're going

529
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:55,229
to exceed 90 percent of likeliness this

530
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:57,989
is surprising itself that's why it's a

531
00:33:55,229 --> 00:34:00,389
paradox and using this fact an attack

532
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:03,629
was the sign that it works with all hash

533
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:07,738
functions if we want a hash function

534
00:34:03,629 --> 00:34:11,868
that has an N length and an attack it's

535
00:34:07,739 --> 00:34:15,809
designed based on the birthday paradox

536
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:18,960
the time required to you of fine by

537
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:22,980
brute force a collusion is 2 to the

538
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,529
power of n halves so and currently for

539
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:30,240
us to feel safe we would need a length

540
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:33,649
up at least 256 for the time required to

541
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:37,469
find the collision would be long enough

542
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:40,230
and therefore not a matter of concern it

543
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:42,359
seems it seems that with a point a

544
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:47,159
computer that is sufficiently powerful

545
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:50,819
with enough Quantic doors and time it's

546
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:53,309
not reduced as much it would be to ^ and

547
00:34:50,819 --> 00:34:57,410
thirds so it would be enough to broaden

548
00:34:53,309 --> 00:35:00,859
the length of the hash function to 384

549
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:05,190
if we don't want

550
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:08,190
resistance to collisions but second

551
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:10,650
image the birthday paradox wouldn't help

552
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,960
us this sign attack we need to do this

553
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,789
using brute force and the time would be

554
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,069
2 to the power of n and the left would

555
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:19,890
be lower smaller and we wouldn't need

556
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:20,500
such a long length and it seems that in

557
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,990
this case

558
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,960
quantum computers don't have a

559
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:29,020
devastating effect and it would simply

560
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,330
reduce to two and to the broth and a

561
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:35,830
half so the length wouldn't be

562
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:39,130
multiplied significantly another type of

563
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:42,610
problems that we need to consider when

564
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:44,980
considering cryptography are those that

565
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:52,300
are linked to reticles and more

566
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:54,130
specifically short Richter's what are we

567
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:57,790
really talking about when we talk about

568
00:35:54,130 --> 00:36:00,610
reticulum it's a subgroup of a vectorial

569
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,320
space after I mentioned and if we think

570
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:05,550
about a plane point so we think about

571
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:10,300
the ability to generated by 0 1 and 0 0

572
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:13,630
we would be drawing like fisherman's net

573
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:16,300
a mesh and the vertex vortexes would be

574
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,820
the point of the reticulum so in a

575
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:22,390
reticulum we had K vectors that are

576
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:25,570
linearly independent and all linear

577
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:30,100
combinations of those vectors give us a

578
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:32,770
reticulum so and the reticulum we can

579
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,080
have more than one base or we can

580
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:36,970
generate this with different faces and

581
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,770
what do they share well the fact that

582
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:41,410
they have the same number of elements if

583
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:45,759
I generate a particular them with a base

584
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:49,120
of four elements whatever other base I

585
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:53,260
find will also have four elements one of

586
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:56,830
the pelvis that we know that it's hard

587
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:59,410
to solve in computational terms yes of

588
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:02,410
finding in a random particular vector

589
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:05,109
with a shortest length length understood

590
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:08,379
whether you keep you Canadian metrics

591
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:12,250
that we've studied at school and this is

592
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,650
a problem that can be exploited with

593
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:18,070
cryptographic purposes and now they're

594
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:20,049
probably related to this although it was

595
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:23,469
slightly different

596
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:25,869
is what happens when we get a point of

597
00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:27,910
the art and pictorial space and find a

598
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:30,579
vector from the reticulum that is as

599
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:32,649
close as possible to this point and this

600
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:37,259
is a room that is considered to be

601
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:39,789
difficult to solve yes there is another

602
00:37:37,259 --> 00:37:43,779
significant problem which is that of

603
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:46,209
reduction of a reticulum base ie finding

604
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:49,989
a face with good properties I'm

605
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:54,519
referring to base made up of small size

606
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:59,259
shorten and vectors and this problem is

607
00:37:54,519 --> 00:38:03,368
also tough reduction can be fixed in

608
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:05,199
different manners we can be in demand

609
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:08,380
more or less to the elements of the base

610
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:11,140
but it's an important problem because if

611
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:14,289
we want to design an efficient procedure

612
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:18,999
with traps that allow us in a reticulum

613
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:21,279
to find short Landa reticulum it's not

614
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:23,379
the same to work with one base row with

615
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:25,029
another with some bases the problem is

616
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,410
impossible to solve there's no

617
00:38:25,029 --> 00:38:29,049
reasonable time to do this

618
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:32,410
but there are some vases with some more

619
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:34,810
or short vectors with which you can work

620
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:38,220
and the process can be done

621
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:40,509
in a reasonable period of time so

622
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:43,029
reasonable processes to calculate

623
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:45,460
shorter vectors requires a routine the

624
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:53,980
ability to calculate appropriate based

625
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:57,400
reductions good let's move on another

626
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,020
problem that uses what we call error

627
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,930
corrective codes

628
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:05,140
the idea behind error correcting codes

629
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:08,080
is as follows initially when we think

630
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:11,140
that this is close to cryptography and

631
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:15,610
that what we do is also encrypt but what

632
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:19,900
we do truly is code because the goal is

633
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:24,610
essentially different we modify a

634
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:27,790
message and we encrypt it so people

635
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:30,640
don't know what we're saying and

636
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:32,980
corrective codes what we try to do is

637
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,230
ensure the reliability of information I

638
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:41,200
we just met and fell through a noisy

639
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:43,900
Channel and there is some sort of

640
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,589
perturbation sound electromagnetic

641
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:50,170
perturbations physical alterations of

642
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:52,060
their message when the message reach the

643
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,560
destination we need to be able to detect

644
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,560
that there have been alterations in

645
00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:00,160
order to correct them so for example we

646
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,779
use satellites that take pictures so

647
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,480
let's imagine that we send a satellite

648
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:07,570
to take pictures of the moon a specific

649
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,130
face to be then sent back to Planet

650
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,600
Earth and we can say well there's no

651
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,150
problem if when those we receive the

652
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,220
picture is flawed it can take further

653
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,110
pictures but maybe that's not possible

654
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,180
because the position of the moon has

655
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,710
changed and the new picture sent from

656
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,290
this satellite will not provide us with

657
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,300
it info we're looking for that's why

658
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:30,100
it's very important that we are able to

659
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:32,620
correct the errors produced and the

660
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,440
daily basis computers are constantly

661
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,210
managing corrective codes or corrective

662
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,380
codes because the data that are stored

663
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:42,119
need to be stored with a code that

664
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,579
there's an error in the processing of

665
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:48,410
that info allows to detect that error

666
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:51,660
and to recover it in an automatic way

667
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:54,839
error corrective codes are another

668
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:58,078
important field of research that resort

669
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:00,269
to mathematics and in this case we're

670
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,140
only going to think about linear codes

671
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:04,019
okay

672
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:08,460
linear codes are always build based on

673
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:13,038
our pictorial space on a finite body as

674
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:16,499
you know finite bodies are in this field

675
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:19,019
superstars in the past because of the

676
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:21,149
influence of physicists we only talked

677
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:25,279
about real numbers and complex numbers

678
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:28,349
in the best of cases and we live aside

679
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:32,220
rational numbers and finite bodies but

680
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:33,930
with these new theories the theory of

681
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,368
finite bodies has played an essential

682
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,169
role it's no longer something

683
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:40,529
sophisticated something very

684
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,950
sophisticated we ultra expert and invent

685
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:45,089
it

686
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:49,439
and now play your stellar role so we're

687
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:52,589
talking about finite bodies a series of

688
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,739
elements in the finite body and that

689
00:41:52,589 --> 00:42:01,609
hold or use of a space as I mentioned K

690
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:06,869
the curve but it does is called elements

691
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:09,180
that add additional elements up until n

692
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:13,349
so that those elements that don't

693
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:16,578
contain info allow us to detect errors

694
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:23,329
and then correct them so these

695
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:25,829
parameters are essential together with

696
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:29,130
other elements that provide us with

697
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:32,150
corrective capabilities when we want to

698
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:35,279
build a code we do this by multiplying

699
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,120
matrixes we have a generating magic

700
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:39,210
skate

701
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:41,960
and sighs and we get the ketchup ooh

702
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:46,260
that can change the digits of them

703
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:50,850
message and obtain the number we're

704
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,520
looking for in this act or Aeolus pace

705
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:56,370
and a finite body we also have a metric

706
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,640
that is very different to Euclidean

707
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:02,910
metrics and this is what we call hamming

708
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:07,740
distance and what Hamming distance says

709
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:09,540
is that tells us how many positions are

710
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:13,200
different between two different elements

711
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:16,290
that's what this Hamming distance tells

712
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,140
us the problem when it comes to decoding

713
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:21,630
is that we're trying to find effective

714
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:25,879
mechanisms so that when we receive the

715
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:28,800
coded word we're able to detect errors

716
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,960
if it's not the case we recover the info

717
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,600
received immediately but if there have

718
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,390
been errors we recover the correct and

719
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:39,420
for the word that was truly sent before

720
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:41,779
the channel alter the words through

721
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:45,330
knowing or because of whatever reason

722
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:47,640
and of course we cannot correct as many

723
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:50,220
errors as you wish the number of errors

724
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,319
we can incorrect is at your mind not

725
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,990
only by the physical features of the

726
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,570
channel would also by be corrective

727
00:43:54,990 --> 00:44:00,899
capability of the code we are using and

728
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:03,960
this corrective capacity can be known a

729
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,530
priori by knowing the minimum distance

730
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:12,090
of the code ie by knowing the smallest

731
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:15,690
distance between two code words when we

732
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:18,030
build these codes the words of the code

733
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,740
need to be sufficiently separated so

734
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,570
that the minimum distance between them

735
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:25,709
is sufficiently big to allow us to

736
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:28,080
correct errors in order to correct an

737
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:31,290
error you need a minimum distance of

738
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:35,880
three because if we have a minimum

739
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:38,520
distance D the code can and they take -1

740
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:43,800
errors and can correct

741
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:46,170
d / 2 errors when we design these skills

742
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,839
what we're looking for is for the

743
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,670
dimension to be big enough I mentioned

744
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,920
okay it's the subspace because this

745
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:56,430
basically tells us that we can code many

746
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,249
words at a time the length can be too

747
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:03,029
big however because in length ads or

748
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:05,160
aggregates control digits in order to

749
00:45:03,029 --> 00:45:07,200
correct errors if we aggregate a great

750
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,999
deal we will be losing efficiency in

751
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,538
terms of money and time because the time

752
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:14,189
devoted Forest costs money and on the

753
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:16,319
other one we want distance to be

754
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:18,509
sufficiently big to be able to correct a

755
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,019
reasonable number of errors and of

756
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:24,900
course these three objectives are

757
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:28,140
sometimes incompatible it's they are

758
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:32,609
interrelated but we can contribute to

759
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:35,879
one part be detrimental to another good

760
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:39,109
we know that the decoding problem in

761
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:45,289
linear codes is an np-complete problem

762
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:48,150
ie a problem for which there is no known

763
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:50,729
algorithm that can solve it and should

764
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:53,930
it exist it would probably tell us that

765
00:45:50,729 --> 00:46:00,629
crash P and class and P coincide

766
00:45:53,930 --> 00:46:03,749
therefore this could only be solved in

767
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:06,989
polynomial time with an algorithm

768
00:46:03,749 --> 00:46:09,649
however this also know that there are

769
00:46:06,989 --> 00:46:09,650
some codes

770
00:46:10,819 --> 00:46:18,180
coach for which every use matrix a

771
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:20,869
specific metric for these codes we can

772
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:24,719
do this in a reasonable amount of time

773
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:27,930
and how can we build them the go part

774
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:32,569
coach our mathematical code of point of

775
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,569
view are very simple we use irreducible

776
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,160
polynomial and the fourth mathematic

777
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:44,150
problem I wanted to talk to you about is

778
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,299
the MQ probably multi linear quadratic

779
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:49,079
problems

780
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:53,160
that tells us that if we have polynomial

781
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:55,319
equations of several quadratic degree

782
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,499
two variables with coefficients in a

783
00:46:55,319 --> 00:47:00,170
finite body finding common solutions to

784
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:04,790
all these equations is

785
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:06,619
very tough problems in fact if the

786
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,630
number of variables that we are using

787
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:10,640
the number of fully known was are

788
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:18,500
comparable and have a comparable size

789
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:22,160
this problem is np-complete as well why

790
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:24,619
have we chosen I have I chosen these

791
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,040
points well because based on these

792
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:30,410
problems there are some cryptographic

793
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,890
constructions of encryption systems and

794
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:37,250
digital signature systems that do

795
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:41,118
hope and light to the continuity of

796
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:45,109
cryptography and a post quantum period

797
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:48,740
we know that currently the two systems

798
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:53,000
that are most using cryptography are RSA

799
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:57,229
and Curt elliptic curve cryptography or

800
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,089
EC and this is of course a personal

801
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,059
opinion and one of the reasons why they

802
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:03,470
are used aside from their effectiveness

803
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:04,910
and they are also efficient and they

804
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:08,169
can't be done a short period of time and

805
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:09,950
it's because during the past years many

806
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,720
implementations have been done there is

807
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:16,089
an industry around this and they have

808
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:19,790
improved the problem know how to choose

809
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:21,319
module and in the RSA or what curve

810
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:23,660
needs to be chosen and some

811
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:25,790
implementations are secure because

812
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,558
they've been honed and fine-tuned each

813
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:29,558
time there was an attack against them

814
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:37,670
the concept of quantum computer that was

815
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:42,259
introduced in the 80s unveiled an

816
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:45,230
underlying threat to public key

817
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:48,770
cryptography because it seemed that

818
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:52,329
quantum computers should if you build

819
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:54,740
would allow for very complex um

820
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,630
equations and transactions should be

821
00:48:54,740 --> 00:49:00,859
done in a very short period of time the

822
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:03,559
threat group when in 1994 Peter shor

823
00:49:00,859 --> 00:49:05,799
presented quantum algorithms that

824
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:07,870
allowed to factor

825
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,150
all numbers and calculate discrete

826
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:14,770
algorithms in polynomial time

827
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:18,190
meaning that using RSA for electrical

828
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:20,080
curve photography and having a quantum

829
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:22,750
computer that was sufficiently powerful

830
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,210
to do is efficient number of quantum

831
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:29,140
operations we would take just as much

832
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:31,510
time and encrypting RSA and elliptical

833
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:35,370
curve so both of these procedures will

834
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:40,150
no longer would no longer be useful and

835
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:44,920
of course we need alternatives be

836
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:48,970
planned in our portfolio so in case

837
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:52,240
quantum computers are built with enough

838
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:54,009
cake capacities we'll need alternatives

839
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,169
because small ones with six or eight

840
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:58,290
quantum doors so of course those have

841
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:01,870
been built but that's not enough and

842
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:03,970
until those large quantum computers our

843
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:07,540
Bellevue will be able to continue using

844
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:10,990
cryptography well very I'm going to run

845
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:14,529
over this because it's a bit late but

846
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:17,259
eyesight from the survey then we have

847
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:19,510
the grover algorithm which is a quantum

848
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:24,040
algorithm that allows you to conduct a

849
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:29,590
series of data and an orderly database

850
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:32,110
if we're given for a telephone book that

851
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:34,600
is not ordered it would be impossible to

852
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:36,880
find a telephone number and this

853
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:43,720
algorithm allows you to find in an

854
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:48,220
unordered database in time that is the

855
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:51,310
root of square root of n and if a

856
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:54,520
quantum computer is developed this would

857
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:57,850
also be affected for example the Dodge

858
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:59,830
and the AES or it could be affected but

859
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,319
the effect is not as devastating or

860
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:04,750
dramatic as and their show algorithm a

861
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,850
wouldn't destroy the use of AES the

862
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,830
advanced encryption standard but we

863
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:10,170
would have to increase the number of

864
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:13,810
keys

865
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:16,630
there are some digital signature schemes

866
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:18,759
that are being used that seem to be

867
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:23,730
secure and efficient and that our face

868
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,730
on hash functions as mentioned earlier

869
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:30,360
there are no encryption systems based on

870
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:33,430
these functions as of today there is

871
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:37,030
much research to be done because there

872
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:41,200
are some drawbacks that this sign is

873
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:45,160
based on binary trees and single years

874
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:47,859
of keys and you need to keep a log of

875
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,710
the keys use the stories therefore

876
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:53,200
capabilities need to be high but there

877
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:55,270
soon for hope here it's promising and

878
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:58,060
seems that we will be able to have

879
00:51:55,270 --> 00:52:00,610
digital signature schemes based on hash

880
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:04,480
functions that can be used up securely

881
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:07,000
and efficiently there are so some multi

882
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,630
variable cryptography based on the

883
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:17,680
problem that I previously described

884
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:22,630
there's public key scheme and what this

885
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:25,569
does as you can see on screen as other's

886
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:34,050
keys based on corrective furs or on

887
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:38,440
reticula this basically put a trap and

888
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:40,840
mask it with others so that once mess

889
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:44,620
the image that you can see is have a

890
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:48,400
ransom image that cannot be decrypted

891
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:51,839
and that's what we do here using multi

892
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,840
variable cryptography

893
00:52:52,829 --> 00:53:00,549
for the sake of time we'll move on I'll

894
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:03,609
skip some slides I just like to say that

895
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:05,799
we can also build encryption schemes for

896
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:07,660
the multivariable choreography we have

897
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:11,410
digital signature and we have encryption

898
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:13,629
and C and for encryption purposes we

899
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:16,868
demand more from that good function

900
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:21,250
aside from being able to find three

901
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:24,579
images were able to re-inject and

902
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:29,500
there's also code based cryptography and

903
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:31,690
this scheme that sicilian force for code

904
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:36,089
based cryptography was introduced by

905
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:40,240
Mike Kelly's in 1978 the same year as

906
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:43,480
RSA this system is considered to be

907
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,899
secure and safe because since it was

908
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,240
introduced it suffered ongoing attacks

909
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:52,089
it exposed vulnerable ities and

910
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:55,450
weaknesses there was this huge RSA

911
00:53:52,089 --> 00:53:58,599
attack that it was launched lunch by the

912
00:53:55,450 --> 00:54:01,808
inventors of RSA but it has survived

913
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:06,400
time up until now it's true that the

914
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:09,970
beginning was less efficient than our sa

915
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,430
but it's being improved and there are

916
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:15,399
some code based schemes that are

917
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:18,970
efficient what it does as in the

918
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,950
previous case is mask the goods

919
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:24,660
generating metrics that allows us to

920
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:27,460
decode a code with other two other

921
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:29,890
metrics as a permutation in a similar

922
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,440
metric so that the owner of the key can

923
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:35,259
decipher but those that tried to do so

924
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,770
using brute force will have problems and

925
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:42,210
decoding a linear code and this is son

926
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:42,210
np-complete problem which is hard to so

927
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:52,140
in this case asides from encryption we

928
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:54,720
have digital signature schemes an

929
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:59,190
encryption scheme based on this I'm

930
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:02,310
regarding reticula I like to say that

931
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:07,700
there are some photography based on

932
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:10,860
reticula this cryptography what it does

933
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:16,379
is exactly the same as the previous ones

934
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:19,110
we have a reticulum and we have info

935
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,810
that tells us that the base is good that

936
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:23,760
the length is short and therefore we can

937
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:25,500
implement in an effective manner for

938
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,350
serial procedure in order to calculate

939
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:31,590
the shorter Specter so what we do is use

940
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:35,339
it for encryption purposes and we mask

941
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:37,650
and what we provide is on their base

942
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:39,540
with poorer properties than that doesn't

943
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:42,000
allow to calculate the shorter specter

944
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:44,910
how do we improve this by introducing an

945
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,760
error so that what we obtain is not a

946
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:49,770
vector from the reticulum we then

947
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:52,500
recover the message because we know how

948
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:54,690
to calculate the vector of the closest

949
00:55:52,500 --> 00:56:00,360
reticulum but the person that wants to

950
00:55:54,690 --> 00:56:05,070
intercept it is unable to do so and the

951
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:06,930
chicken base cryptography but we're

952
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:10,290
seeing as that great progress is being

953
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:14,790
made much work has been done to fine

954
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:17,220
tune it and digital signature schemes

955
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:20,970
have been disowned but there are some

956
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:23,250
security issues associated why well

957
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:26,609
because the implementations that have

958
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:30,660
been done to make them efficient are not

959
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:33,870
based on reticulum issues but others

960
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:36,390
that stem from them and therefore we

961
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:38,940
cannot demonstrate improve security in

962
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:41,629
such an effective and efficient manner

963
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:44,690
there are important drawbacks and

964
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:48,960
conservation and

965
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:52,200
he's happy used in a homomorphic

966
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:57,210
cryptography homomorphic cryptography is

967
00:56:52,200 --> 00:57:00,839
another subject that has drawn attention

968
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:04,470
for a long time some people said it was

969
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:07,500
a holy cause of cryptography and the

970
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:10,529
goal was to design encryption systems to

971
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:13,770
operate with encrypted data

972
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:18,140
this may seem unnecessary but if you

973
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:23,460
think about examples you can see the

974
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:25,950
usefulness the cloud storage data and

975
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:29,970
some hospital storage disaggregated data

976
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:32,399
from patients that they then improve to

977
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:37,319
send to the cloud what's normalized to

978
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:40,109
send the data encrypted to privacy by

979
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:43,410
this data can also help us calculate

980
00:57:40,109 --> 00:57:47,430
statistical data and help us help us

981
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:50,788
take a diagnosis decisions the statistic

982
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:55,308
decisions that are made are simple some

983
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:59,670
days averages or standard deviations and

984
00:57:55,309 --> 00:58:02,039
if we have homomorphic cryptography that

985
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:04,079
allows us to operate with encrypted data

986
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:08,430
so that the encryption of the sum is the

987
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:10,650
sum of the encryptions when we want to

988
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:12,930
do statistical calculations we don't

989
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:15,270
need to download data decipher them do

990
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:17,910
our mess and then upload them again

991
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:20,430
after encrypting them again know with

992
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:23,308
decipher we do or the mess and we save a

993
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:27,328
lot of time in the process the solution

994
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:29,020
should have a more of a cryptography the

995
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:32,170
first is saying

996
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:35,650
of homomorphic a choreography appeared

997
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:39,610
and more of these dissertation as it was

998
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:42,730
reticulum based so as a conclusion I

999
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:46,990
would say that there is a huge field of

1000
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:50,140
work to conduct research to see how we

1001
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:54,549
can apply maths to promote cybersecurity

1002
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:58,720
and cryptographic systems both in terms

1003
00:58:54,550 --> 00:59:01,860
of digital signature and encryption and

1004
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:04,149
can be used the idea is that

1005
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:07,450
cryptography can have a promising of

1006
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:10,119
future and a post quantum scenario these

1007
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:12,730
are the references that I've directly

1008
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:14,590
quoted I haven't included them all but

1009
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:16,300
if you're interested I can give you the

1010
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:20,280
indirect references and thank you very

1011
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:20,280
much everybody for your attention

1012
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,880
you
