00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:17,400
thank you very much to you and first of

3
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,529
all thank you very much for to cyber

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,509
come for having invited me to be here

5
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,239
with you today and I would like to

6
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:31,919
welcome you to my talk and a morning

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:35,879
10:30 and in the Sunday well it's not a

8
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:39,239
typical day and time of the week to give

9
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:41,250
a presentation all right and I said in

10
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,519
my it was said in my presentation I will

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:47,700
be talking about this shortage in the

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,110
market of cybersecurity experts so this

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,300
is the table of contents of my talk I

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,410
will give you an introduction then I

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,690
will talk about the current situation

16
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,140
that I wish I was used some to such a

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,809
studies then which will cover out well

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:10,590
real life and then conclusions this is

19
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:13,829
me this is my introduction is light ok

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:16,889
this is me with all these labels

21
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:20,609
stickers and all these names and icons

22
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:23,789
well indices of for me ok this is my

23
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:27,179
Twitter address you may follow me if you

24
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:29,909
want to fit in my ego all right so now

25
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:34,200
let us move on right into my talk well

26
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:39,359
often I give talks about IOT embarrass

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:42,329
sister drones hacking hardware so this

28
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:47,068
is what I focus when I give deliver

29
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:51,919
technical presentations nevertheless for

30
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:55,799
in recent years have been observing the

31
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:59,340
labor market situation what is being

32
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,950
said about security security jobs and

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,859
therefore would move on and talk about

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,929
current situation so therefore I'm going

35
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:13,069
to move on to the number of news 350,000

36
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,069
experts in cyber security

37
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:20,959
searched two sets of company do not have

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,430
enough personnel to face challenges and

39
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,260
threats in the network more news

40
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,260
along those lines this is one of my

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,450
favorite months or so from a pice

42
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:36,170
companies are desperate in the search

43
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,040
for personnel with technological

44
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,040
expertise

45
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:53,239
I hear you say well then technology

46
00:02:45,250 --> 00:03:00,530
branches with the highest job offers and

47
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:02,510
job vacancies so there are many news and

48
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:06,380
articles in these regards about how

49
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:11,000
companies could fill that gap of

50
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:16,970
shortage of technology profiles so this

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,769
is what we see in the news news 45

52
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,970
percent of companies are facing a big

53
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:28,540
problem they do not have enough cyber

54
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:32,860
security experts shortage of 900,000

55
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:39,649
experts so the previous news was about

56
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:44,090
350,000 now they say 900,000 so

57
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:47,239
companies want to live bridge the gap

58
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:53,510
between training and education and job

59
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:55,220
markets so in 2020 3.5 million

60
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,328
expressing cybersecurity will be

61
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:02,799
demanded in the market and welding

62
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:08,329
megawatts a design news in mainstream

63
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,350
papers but is not only that we also have

64
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:11,750
people at MIT

65
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,569
well people at MIT are taking to be very

66
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,589
serious and they said that the shortage

67
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:20,750
affects first in cybersecurity obliges

68
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:22,940
them to hire students it is estimated

69
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:27,350
that in 2021

70
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:32,560
there will be 3.5 million of job

71
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,560
vacancies open

72
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:43,180
therefore to fill that gap companies are

73
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:48,009
putting their eyes on or resorting to

74
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:51,240
students okay let me check there well we

75
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:55,690
don't have an expert in cybersecurity

76
00:04:51,240 --> 00:05:01,590
there either and I quote wonder where do

77
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:07,660
those news and from and as I say I

78
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:10,630
decided to search about the origins of

79
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:14,590
those news the first thing that I do was

80
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,830
just to consult a PDF file of by in

81
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,830
feeder

82
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,180
and this has been taken out from the PDF

83
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,110
file

84
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,850
published by exhibit but we can read on

85
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,770
the one hand we have directories and on

86
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:41,630
the other hand we'll have talent

87
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:46,389
recruiters are demanding experts in

88
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,389
cybersecurity with technical expertise

89
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:54,380
Adam and a professional has been

90
00:05:51,190 --> 00:06:02,120
increasing in the last decade on an

91
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:04,550
ongoing basis this is the source of this

92
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,620
data and then on the right we can read

93
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:14,660
as follows people with talent in 2020

94
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:19,880
this will be a big explosion so be

95
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:21,530
careful and protect yourselves so we

96
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,930
have to detect it it's Halland

97
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:29,388
leak well I'm glad that that has been

98
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,650
detected this is like the water in

99
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,780
Niagara Falls

100
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,049
and there is something here which says

101
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,109
here and a small error that says that

102
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:43,380
these studies are based on is situ which

103
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:49,800
is the International information system

104
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:53,280
security consortium and he specifically

105
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,070
refers to 2015 study however there is a

106
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,559
latest one it's about global information

107
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,560
security workforce study

108
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:14,210
one of the actions that are proposed by

109
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:17,150
infidel it greenfile is become a haka so

110
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:20,320
there were fourteen action suggested

111
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,320
this was one of them

112
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:30,020
career orientation in cybersecurity for

113
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,020
teenagers and young people

114
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,470
so it seems as I'll be interactive they

115
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:40,970
really want to appeal people to the

116
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,970
fields of security

117
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,380
I consulted the study that I mentioned

118
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,380
before

119
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,970
and what did I find in that study a

120
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,580
question now how many of you do never

121
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,860
ever realized that there was a soul THC

122
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:10,840
of talent in cybersecurity have you ever

123
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:13,930
read this studies has anyone consulted

124
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,859
his studies and read them well I did

125
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,860
that myself

126
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:26,060
and I checked the methodology used for

127
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:33,770
data study and noticed this was a

128
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:36,890
methodology a survey this study they

129
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,590
didn't check the job offers or anything

130
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,929
else they just follow the results of

131
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:51,440
service service contacted to a number of

132
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:55,219
individuals but they don't have yeah

133
00:08:51,440 --> 00:09:01,310
only 1% of cyber security experts are

134
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:06,550
out of the job market are unemployed 19

135
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:06,550
two percent of hiring managers

136
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,230
so that experience in cybersecurity is

137
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,210
important

138
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:19,700
[Music]

139
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:22,580
and they also show a graph about 20 22

140
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,410
and the number of experts that will be

141
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:29,240
needed and that will not be found but

142
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,310
this is found on the opinion of

143
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,740
professionals I don't know that you've

144
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:40,550
seen the film Harry the Dirty Harry I

145
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:43,280
really like that movie and especially

146
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:52,839
once I said well opinions are like butts

147
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:52,839
everyone husband copan ok let us see

148
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,540
well this is highly respectable again

149
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,800
let us see what their opinion Elysee

150
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:06,250
who's behind that research study and

151
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,250
that survey

152
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:15,500
so here we have auditors analysts and

153
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:21,050
architects strategists consultants

154
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:25,610
managers okay that is to say hi people

155
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:29,660
who hire this is opinion of those who

156
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:31,820
will be hiring experts so they gave

157
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:34,130
their opinion and they say well we are

158
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,580
needing personnel with there is a

159
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,890
shortage of talent and of experts here

160
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:44,060
on the Left we have this pie chart and

161
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:46,370
when they say well I primarily asked my

162
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:53,209
colleagues from the internet consortium

163
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:55,339
and well they give me the opinion about

164
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,050
the situation in the market ok and now

165
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,880
this is the source of that research

166
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:04,040
study you want to you want to find out

167
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,600
more don't ya people's opinions

168
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,740
professional opinions this is

169
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,110
respectable

170
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:14,930
but it is just an opinion and now I'd

171
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,450
like to show you this other piece of

172
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:24,140
news that was published some time ago

173
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:29,270
and say it was a news about the CEO of

174
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:31,910
an AV manufacturer not appealing this

175
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:35,810
generation to this professional could

176
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:38,270
end up having high costs because there

177
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,760
is a limited amount of talent in

178
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,650
cybersecurity which is not been taking

179
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,140
advantage stuff which is not being

180
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,540
exploited and these people in would end

181
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,430
up working in different industries they

182
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,819
were saying that nor appealing this

183
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:58,099
talent would cost high amounts of money

184
00:11:52,820 --> 00:12:01,339
I don't know what that you are here to

185
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:06,699

193
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:37,380
a CEO and I said okay 65% of future jobs

194
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:47,710
do not yet exist when they go says 65%

195

197
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,230
future if I could sell the future things

198
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,830

201

students would end up having jobs that

202
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:08,529

206
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,290

209
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:36,420
in one of its articles set the following

210
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:41,899
the myth of the skills gap

211
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,899
he says well something doesn't work up

212
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:49,589
okay this is from a confidential

213
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:51,750
newspaper well the life the following

214
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:55,800
day there are good enough jobs but

215
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:58,430
people are not qualified enough and now

216
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,430
I need some water

217
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:15,970
look if you make a big effort to say

218
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:18,160
that the Reese skill cap why are you

219
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,210
saying that that there is a capitalistic

220
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,209
optimistic up

221
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:30,860
can you imagine a young person saying

222
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:37,740
well there is a god of companies

223
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:40,980
demanding my skills imagine someone

224
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:45,140
saying that on TV whether we go and say

225
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,140
look god are you stupid

226
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:52,819
that's a go-getter life okay find

227
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,819
yourself a job

228
00:14:53,450 --> 00:15:01,350
however a well eve company says as a

229
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,870
reason cop there is no problem but young

230
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:07,950
people or students cannot really say

231
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:10,650
that there are no companies offering

232
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:15,630
them a job okay this is how to market

233
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:20,939
poses I do drawings okay this is a

234
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:26,640
closed loop and this is the way the free

235
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:29,100
markets operates when I say free markets

236
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,260
I'm referring not only it well to the

237
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,670
basic legal aspects that are taken for

238
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:38,670
granted but it goes on to the following

239
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:41,189
if I have something that you want that

240
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:44,430
is to say my skills okay I'm ready to

241
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:47,520
share my skills with you as long as I

242
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:50,130
get some money in return so this is the

243
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,230
way it goes if there is a good match if

244
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,990
there is a good fit okay we just enter

245
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:58,800
into an agreement and this thing about

246
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:02,910
an excess of or a shortage of or a cup

247
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:07,280
of well we should kind of understand it

248
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,280
or kind of refresh it

249
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:13,950
I'll go and say or we had but companies

250
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:20,250
are desperate in the search for talent

251
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:22,800
well I don't doubt that but I'm going to

252
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:27,000
say okay I will visiting for jobs on

253
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,240
site I will visit job portals and we'll

254
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,940
type in cyber security and then I will

255
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,110
press ENTER and then these are the

256
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:42,380
results that I get results are again

257
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:47,630
have somehow curious or interested in

258
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:51,300

you will get when you go and see that

264
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:10,458
you say well I don't think that

265
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,459
companies are that desperate

266
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:22,540
go forgot that I'm in the deserts and

267
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,540

272
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:45,520
water this is not good for my stomach

273
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:50,690
I'll give my answer well why don't you

274
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:53,230
desperate for water well this is kind of

275
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:57,170
a curious desperation

276
00:17:53,230 --> 00:18:01,520
according to SPE which is a government

277
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:05,930
entity for employment studying the job

278
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,900
market as EPE says the average salary of

279
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:11,420
extra security is in the range of

280
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,580
seventeen thousand to thirty three some

281
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,250
sense I'm not going to say whether this

282
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,830
is too high or too low that should be

283
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,330
checked against other professions for

284
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,939
instance I don't know working out at

285
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,520
seal in the supermarket okay which is

286
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:29,660
also within that salary rate so for

287
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,780
instance I don't know installer of AC

288
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:37,180
equipments air conditioning equipment

289
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,180
and I said I wouldn't say anything else

290
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:48,928
and one company says well we want to

291
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:51,660
hire people with a vocation but sadly

292
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:53,100
you will be in the following situation

293
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,320
because it happened to me before when

294
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,370
you go to a job interview to go there

295
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,428
you tell them about your skills and then

296
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,080
they tell me about the money they tell

297
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:05,970
me about this salary I cannot really

298
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,449
mention the salary they have to mention

299
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:11,340
that first okay and then job interview

300
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,740
years ago myself well regarding salary

301
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,480
we are looking for talent with vocation

302
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,450
and I said look I'd already told you

303
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,970
about my vocation I am I took a

304
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,130
technical test and I also answered all

305
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,580
your technical questions and I told you

306
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:29,820
about my skills training education and

307
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:34,309
well surely you will end up going to job

308
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:36,928
interviews and then markets and wealthy

309
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:40,530
companies will find different varying

310
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:42,960
techniques ok to hear less ok and well

311
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:46,410
most if that were to be the case in the

312
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,179
past moosa would have been fired they

313
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:52,370
would have said well they would have

314
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,370
thought that he was not talented enough

315
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:05,330
well we are looking for talent we need

316
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:07,250
salads but is talent about talent is not

317
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,669
about you

318
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:19,210
infused capacity talent is something

319
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:23,710
that the others can do many years ago

320
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:27,400
drivers were considered to be silent

321
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:30,980
people and now that has changed because

322
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:35,330
over time more people learn how to read

323
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:38,540
and write so vendetta there is skills or

324
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:41,350
talent cup then if you apply the supply

325
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:45,409
and demand equation what is the

326
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:47,840
resultant - the result I - that is like

327
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:52,670
I want to hire talent but I just don't

328
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:58,189
want to having to negotiate anything

329
00:20:52,670 --> 00:21:01,940
okay let me explain this when you hear

330
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:07,280
that companies have difficulty in hiring

331
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:10,580
experts and especially experts to feel

332
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,850
top positions and I said well I wish

333
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:16,730
this is true which this is what actually

334
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:20,209
happens well I hope that companies have

335
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:23,000
difficulty in that because if companies

336
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,520
come here whatever they want at any time

337
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,809
wherever they want they will not be

338
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,809
ready to pay for it

339
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:36,389
so well if so that would just decide not

340
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,950
to pay as much as they should pay

341
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:43,030
someone they said that there is a talent

342
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:44,830
Cup they mean doesn't want that talent

343
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:48,129
right away and if they don't like that

344
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:51,669
talent that there will be other talented

345
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:54,580
and person waiting for that job and as I

346
00:21:51,670 --> 00:22:00,450
say your talent is not measure but what

347
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:05,530
you can do but what the others cannot do

348
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:08,110
so what companies want is just too well

349
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,460
for talent to increase as much as

350
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,010
possible so that they don't have to

351
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:17,020
negotiate anything and this is like

352
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:19,210
printing money saying that there is a

353
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:24,070
talent Cup it is my saying that there is

354
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:25,990
a Gold Cup how much do you think gold

355
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:30,040
will be worth if everyone will have a

356
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:36,660
hundred kilos of gold at home same price

357
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:39,909
same value or five cents less the value

358
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,620
was in Madrid I was traveling by tube

359
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:44,380
and there was a person backing from

360
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:47,879
money well imagine that if I contact

361
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:52,690
this person well would you do you need

362
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,790
Tesla car and we go and say do not think

363
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,130
about the cost of it do you want a Tesla

364
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,139
car and Hebron sell of course I wanted

365
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:01,840
give it to me okay

366
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,870
alone one more car to manufacture

367
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:09,070
because there is person who wants it

368
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:13,449
okay this is the mechanics one but is

369
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:15,879
behind these Rosetta studies okay let us

370
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,570
go back to this night

371
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:24,770
okay we're hiring managers I asked

372
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:26,960
whether they want to have more people to

373
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,350
negotiate with what type of question is

374
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,030
that it's the same as asking me to say

375
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,040
okay would you like not having to

376
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,080
negotiate or agree on anything with

377
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,180
anyone so that is to say that you will

378
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,010
have so many people available to you

379
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,900
that if you didn't like someone you will

380
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:44,750
have very many other people to choose

381
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:47,210
from so asking this type of question to

382
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:51,010
hiring managers it is like

383
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,010
yourself when you are playing cards

384
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:59,910
and when these hiring managers are asked

385
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:02,580
how many talent do you want to have okay

386
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:05,640
what kind you really showed that there

387
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:09,389
is actual demand or that there is an

388
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,830
actual cap so company shira's ask

389
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,750
themselves do I have it good enough

390
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,740
infrastructure to be competitive in the

391
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:21,750
market to have having a position to

392
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:25,429
respond to the market demand such a

393
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:28,590
promise here is thinking that any job

394
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:32,120
vacancy that they have it's just a

395
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:35,340
prepare to be filled and if there is a

396
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,949
job vacancy is a problem but anyway if

397
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,439
it is a problem it is do problem but it

398
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,750
is not a problem of society not a

399
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,049
problem of students not a problem of

400
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:48,809
anyone it is you want an only problem

401
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:54,510
the same problem that students or young

402
00:24:48,809 --> 00:25:00,030
people face when they are well to be

403
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:03,179
hired / to get a job well will have

404
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:05,580
never heard from young people saying

405
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,400
well there is a shortage of companies or

406
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,799
companies who are not ready to pay me

407
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,910
for my skills or to acknowledge my

408
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:24,320
talent all right

409
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:29,150
now time for stem vocation well travel

410
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:36,620
you've heard that there is a gap in STEM

411
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:40,640
jobs companies will demand - a lot in

412
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:45,739
the future well if you don't follow me

413
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:50,300
in Twitter I'll recommend you do it you

414
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:54,860
will see that sometimes I write about

415
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,990
STEM vocation something I wonder why and

416
00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:01,219
I say why well because they were always

417
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:05,210
moving in that direction but you may go

418
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:07,610
and say well call me crazy but I want

419
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,370
people to do whatever they want to do

420
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:14,060
with their own life well if they want to

421
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:16,810
go into stem career good but if they

422
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,460
don't want to follow that direction

423
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,230
that's good for them I'm not going to

424
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,300
tell them what they should do with their

425
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,290
life that they're myself not the

426
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:29,899
industry nor anyone else so I have to

427
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:32,780
feel in that stems occasion should be

428
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:35,060
fostered is it because someone is just

429
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:38,960
hunting money well they're counting

430
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:43,250
money and in their balance they do know

431
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:47,180
well the balance do not back out there's

432
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:50,270
another half a problem this is not Henry

433
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:53,060
Ford anyone who do whatever they want to

434
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:56,300
do with their life as long as what they

435
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:59,379
do with their life is stem our follow

436
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,379
system direction

437
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:10,059
well Tim profiles will be highly

438
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:14,470
cemented by companies when I paid taxes

439
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:16,418
I want young people to be trained to be

440
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:21,580
good citizens I just wanted to be

441
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:24,429
distribute guys of the 21st century so

442
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:28,360
it is not a question of manufacturing if

443
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:32,740
young people just to cover for dark STEM

444
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:37,449
jobs gap that's what I pay my successful

445
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:41,039
I want people in society to be trained

446
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:45,070
but to be trained there across the board

447
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:48,158
have you ever heard about where

448
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:50,950
programming should be taught in the

449
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,919
classroom should be one sub little

450
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,559
school I'm very happy about that but we

451
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:03,120
should ask one why to broaden the

452
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:06,750
horizon or of people's mind work because

453
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,120
industry or companies are demanding that

454
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,090
okay

00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,539
make a difference in my talks between

492
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:53,000

497
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:12,559

498
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:15,379
before my talk I don't this drone with

499
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:21,830
Chinese sticks and a Spanish guy came to

500
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:25,340
me and we started to talk and he said

501
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:31,460
I'm hi hi people and I have a problem

502
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:33,470
and there's a shortage of people I said

503
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:37,600
I can't believe it even in Vegas I've

504
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:41,000
found this sort of man try cannot be

505
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,250
here on my own and he said oh you're in

506
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,029
love with me lended oh yes I'm going to

507
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:48,889
give a talk about drones well I I've

508
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:50,600
seen a drone that yes I know those guys

509
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:51,979
because I'll give a talk later and he

510
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,279
was trying to explain me with drones

511
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,279
well

512
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:01,370
and he said we have a problem we have a

513
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:05,270
problem because I need people and I

514
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:08,800
can't find them but what's your problem

515
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:12,590
I said it said well the market is

516
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:15,470
growing profiles are more expensive

517
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:18,409
people are leaving if the market goes up

518
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:20,840
people quit and I thought have you ever

519
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:25,460
thought of paying them more money call

520
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:30,320
me crazy but but if the market decreases

521
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:32,210
I don't know about you but when when my

522
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,429
cat decreases you know that it's

523
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:39,680
decreasing Bernie look when it goes up

524
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:44,840
well but what a problem well imagine

525
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:47,180
that I hired a guy that knows half how

526
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:51,230
the things that the people I have there

527
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:53,750
and he charges me twice them their

528
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:56,630
salary well there could be frictions I

529
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,620
said okay you have to manage that some

530
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,450
people will say you're a mercenary

531
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:02,060
you're just looking for money I've been

532
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,540
working in the same company for six

533
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,540
years

534
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,890
you cannot say that changed companies

535
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:18,610
but there's a difference I'm not I am

536
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:23,680
NOT an idiot well it's interesting you

537
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:27,030
have a Spanish guy in front of you his

538
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:31,780
presented in black hat and now has in

539
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:34,870
Def Con and the only thing you can come

540
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:38,830
up with is saying telling that person

541
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:40,629
there's horrible situation this dramatic

542
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:43,179
situation so I guess you're not that

543
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:47,320
desperate I'm happy but what you're

544
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:50,800
saying that's going on and what you're

545
00:33:47,320 --> 00:34:00,909
doing do not match you're not consistent

546
00:33:50,800 --> 00:34:03,129
I tried to give you an example it's like

547
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:07,000
if you say I want to get married but I

548
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:11,740
want people to hidden me I'm not going

549
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,159
to do anything they have to come to me

550
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:17,290
so I'm desperate to get married but I'm

551
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,969
not going to do anything and I'll tell

552
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,590
you another story when I get really

553
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:23,709
really angry and I talked to my parents

554
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:26,230
that grade my parents when I talk to

555
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:30,100
them about this they say just forget

556
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:32,590
about this and my mother says look when

557
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:37,679
I used to work in graphic arts back in

558
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,679
the 70s there was a shortage of

559
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:47,040
machine operators in printing machines

560
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:49,649
so from other companies they came to a

561
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,889
company to talk to the operator and they

562
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:54,540
said you I don't care what your salary

563
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:59,130
is if you come to my company I pay you

564
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:02,450
30% more that's being desperate that's

565
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:05,819
been desperate not this other thing

566
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:08,759
saying oh it's dramatic

567
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:11,490
well you can come to my selection

568
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,940
process if you're desperate you cannot

569
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:23,819
choose anything beggars can't be

570
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:25,829
choosers I'm not saying that you have a

571
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:32,940
specific behavior I'm just comparing

572
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:36,920
your attitude with reality I it's really

573
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:40,530
naive being here on stage explaining

574
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:45,059
supply and demand to companies it's like

575
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:47,430
kids explaining koko the guy from Sesame

576
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:49,410
Street what the difference between being

577
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,350
clothes and being far away from

578
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:53,500
something no he knows that

579
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:57,279
[Music]

580
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:59,230
I don't believe these people don't know

581
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,930
what supply and demand means that they

582
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,670
really know what it means and that's why

583
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:08,710
they're saying that there's a shortage

584
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:11,920
of talent because the more people enter

585
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:13,360
the market the less they will need to

586
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,940
compete for anything

587
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,400
so of course I'm I want to say well not

588
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,670
every company it's the same of course of

589
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:26,410
course we wouldn't be here otherwise

590
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:28,330
so obviously thank you for nothing the

591
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:31,629
companies which are different they

592
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,920
compete what the industry has to do is

593
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,930
competing in the market how can I

594
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,240
attract more people I compete in the

595
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:41,649
market the conditions will go up when

596
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:44,259
people realize what this is funny people

597
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:48,910
say you know young people are not aware

598
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:51,790
of the very good conditions that stem

599
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:54,790
and cyber securities have so you're

600
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:58,210
saying they're stupid right don't you

601
00:36:54,790 --> 00:37:01,450
think then computer is or how things

602
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:04,410
work I knew that and there was no

603
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,410
Facebook back then

604
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:10,440
it's like say my product is very good

605
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,640
but people don't buy it because because

606
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,640
people don't know about it

607
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:20,630
we're asking people to be humble at job

608
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:26,200
interviews I want people to be humble

609
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:28,430
but I'm not its it must be some sort of

610
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,210
offsetting thing because otherwise I

611
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,020
don't get it

612
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:38,530
if you want humble people well you

613
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:38,530
should be humble yourself so conclusions

614
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:46,810
people are told that they need a

615
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,810
vocation and when they have it

616
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,740
you

617
00:37:51,650 --> 00:38:00,720
- let become an excuse for people to

618
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,899
negotiate against it what do I mean

619
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:08,720
since you have application for that you

620
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,720
like this why would we speak about money

621
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:17,250
haven't you said it as an industry and

622
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,750
that moved millions and millions when

623
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:23,520
I've studied I have to study because of

624
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:25,349
my vacation so what is going to be what

625
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:34,589
are you attracting people with vocation

626
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:36,060
people who want money who isn't the IT

627
00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:48,150
industry for money

628
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:49,890
are you an idiot what's the ROI now that

629
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:54,839
people say that I'd have to treat people

630
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:57,299
like a nano company this ROI and things

631
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,890
return on investment you study for five

632
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,770
years bending evidence professional

633
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:06,410
training University you just pay for it

634
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,410
and your time you invest your time

635
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:11,930
for nothing well of course cybersecurity

636
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:13,819
is not for junior people you have to

637
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:19,819
have some sort of experience you need a

638
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:23,058
master's degree or advanced training and

639
00:39:19,819 --> 00:39:24,740
having been a programmer or developer

640
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:28,760
you need something else so that means

641
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:33,078
six years so coding experts from the

642
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,910
industry they say other top positions in

643
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,690
the industry yes if you have studies

644
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:45,170
your degree and a master's degree and he

645
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:48,910
worked in something you may have a

646
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:52,660
position well like in any other place

647
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,660
which is not dead

648
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:06,349
if you're desperate for something you're

649
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,230
not in a position to control the

650
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:11,000
negotiation you cannot say that there's

651
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,549
a shortage of talent and the salary

652
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:19,420
depends on your value it's never it

653
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:23,000
never depends on your value so let's

654
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,740
play - does the prize a technique by

655
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,200
human roses that I love they call you

656
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:31,759
are you interested in a position in the

657
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,558
specific position what's your salary so

658
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,700
what's your figures sorry and I say it's

659
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:37,690

desperate being desperate as well my

676
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:30,460
father told me back in the 70s I didn't

677
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:37,090
even have time to check whether you can

678
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:41,830
do reversing or the version you control

679
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:46,020

682
00:41:52,760 --> 00:42:00,230
if you're desperate about something you

683
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:06,770
cannot establish it the prize you cannot

684
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:16,490
choose you cannot say welcome to my job

685
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:20,210
process perhaps you don't have a clear

686
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:23,689
idea about what you're getting into what

687
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:29,630
is it the IT industry okay are you going

688
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:31,970
to have job yes but it's not a dream

689
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:36,350
industry you need to be different from

690
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:38,660
others if I if I I have to be different

691
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:42,680
from others it's not a shortage you have

692
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:44,870
to study work give talks I need to

693
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,660
upload things indeed have I have to post

694
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:51,950
things well you can divide the number of

695
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:55,399
hours investing that divided by the

696
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:58,180
salary you get perhaps they're paying

697
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:03,770
you less than a supermarket workers I

698
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:05,750
don't want to get them this is what do

699
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:09,520
you want to do would you like doing what

700
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:12,680
we like doing if we were here for money

701
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:18,500
we wouldn't be here but don't think I'm

702
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:22,279
an idiot if you're desperate about

703
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:24,640
talent you cannot wait until it knocks

704
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,640
on your door

705
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:29,710
this is funny they say we look for

706
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:32,780
people we're looking for people I'm

707
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:33,740
going to call a guy I've seen and

708
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,650
LinkedIn

709
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:38,720
I call him are you interested in taking

710
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:41,320
part in my hiring process

711
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:46,189
it's like saying are you interested in

712
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:48,470
proposing to me to get my ball if you if

713
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:55,970
you want to get married propose yourself

714
00:43:48,470 --> 00:44:01,669
don't ask me to propose it's like do you

715
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:03,140
want to come to beg beg me for a job I

716
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,120
don't question that if that's a

717
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,980
situation is it's because the industry

718
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,850
can do it because they have the control

719
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,740
the negotiation power why do they say

720
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:14,600
there's a shortage of talent it's

721
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,819
because they don't want to lose the

722
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,390
negotiation power I want to have enough

723
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:24,860
people asking for a job so that I don't

724
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:27,850
have to offer it myself that's natural

725
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:30,980
who wouldn't want to have that it's

726
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:34,009
natural I'm not questioning that and not

727
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:37,600
criticizing that who wouldn't want to

728
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:42,080
have lots of people coming to you

729
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:43,490
begging for a job so it's saying that

730
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,259
there's a shortage of talent that's not

731
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:47,479
going to change it's an investment

732
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,880
they're doing saying that there's a

733
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,620
shortage of people that has worked for

734
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,140
them for many years and it still works

735
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:56,140
so it's never going to change

736
00:44:57,349 --> 00:45:07,829
because it makes it makes them make

737
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:09,359
money if you do that you stay in the

738
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:12,539
same position you're comfortable

739
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,210
negotiating I want to be in a position

740
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:20,130
in which I don't have to discuss or

741
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:22,440
negotiate anything with anyone when they

742
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:28,470
say oh there are positions or but are

743
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:31,710
not covered yes it's the only way that

744
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:34,288
someone receives a salary higher than

745
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:37,230
the minimum wage why could I pay more if

746
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:39,329
I can't pay less that happens to all of

747
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,279
us if you go to Aliexpress you pay for

748
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:44,609
the cheapest thing everybody does the

749
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:46,980
same thing and so do they so why would

750
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:51,960
they pay more if they can pay less if I

751
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:55,349
can pay less so you would say I offer

752
00:45:51,960 --> 00:46:00,420
someone would say I offer lots of things

753
00:45:55,349 --> 00:46:05,099
but no one's coming well I don't know

754
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:08,039
what to say this is the market other

755
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:12,140
people say well David what you've said

756
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:14,640
it's actually biased because the good

757
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:16,578
offering stop offering sin cyber

758
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,828
security which never get published the

759
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:23,549
salaries you've shown there are biased

760
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:26,190
okay I give you that okay except that

761
00:46:23,549 --> 00:46:28,100
this is biased although it's based on

762
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:32,000
SCP

763
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:34,580
but if you can afford not publish it not

764
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,620
to publish a job offering there's no

765
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:42,049
shortage of people because you're

766
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:44,420
covering you don't need to publish it

767
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:50,330
and you're covering the position so I

768
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:53,710
don't know what you're talking about did

769
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:59,960
you say there's a shortage of people

770
00:46:53,710 --> 00:47:05,060
well it's easier go look for them but

771
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:07,330
you need to say I don't know what do you

772
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:10,520
do would I pay you this amount of money

773
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:12,680
but some people would say money is not

774
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:15,290
everything well anything you can offer

775
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:18,410
to negotiate time flexibility

776
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:22,220
whatever whatever people want doesn't

777
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:27,379
need to be money well not actually we're

778
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:29,859
not speaking just about money I would

779
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:33,320
like to finish my talk by thanking you

780
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:36,840
and if you have any questions I'll be

781
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:41,269
happy to take it thank you very much

782
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,269
[Applause]

783
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,220
you
