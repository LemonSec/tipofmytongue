challenges and many people think that

30
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:51,350
make it here she's passionate about

31

and she points out that her work is a

67
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,180
passionate challenge but it's quite a

68
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:20,228
responsibility she considered

69
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:23,780
cybersecurity as a game of strategy and

70
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:26,120
some sort of escape room where we face

71
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:30,320
different challenges complicated

72
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:37,190

you become attracted to the world of

92
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:49,190
cybersecurity right now there's a

93
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:52,409
significant demand of employment jobs

94
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,890

95
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,050

forward we said okay there are so young

104
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,940
because well so old they must be

105
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,570
thinking what can we tell them about

106
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,790
cybersecurity well I don't know whether

107
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:41,230
all of you come from the technical side

108
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:43,240
of the engineers mathematicians I'm not

109
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,660
familiar with the profiles but cyber

110
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,140
Security's open to any profile what do I

111
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,450
mean by this my professional experience

112
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,700
remain trained experience I have a

113
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:58,450
degree in business administration

114
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:04,060
and I'm managing a cyber security unit

115
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:07,570
and national cyber security so you can

116
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,210
be you need to learn you need to keep on

117
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,950
learning you need to study but it's open

118
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:17,380
to any profile and with regards

119
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:21,690
employment you're aware the technology

120
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:24,460
is moving forward very quickly we have

121
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,540
insufficient artificial intelligence we

122
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:32,060
have big date

123
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:35,010
well facing cyberattacks illegal use of

124
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,510
technology which means that the other

125
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,469
side who need cybersecurity

126
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:42,409
professionals that face the challenges

127
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:47,430
you've mentioned with cybersecurity

128
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:49,050
escape room and Monday and Tuesday was a

129
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,440
world of chrome experiment didn't even

130
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,590
they said that more than 3.5 million

131
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,710
jobs in cybersecurity we will create it

132
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:01,409
in three years time so you have the

133
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:07,310
opportunity before you so it's three

134
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:13,010
years and 3.5 million but if technology

135
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:15,900
advances the demand would be higher here

136
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:19,670
we don't have cybersecurity

137
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:26,359
professionals we need professionals and

138
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:26,360
it's up to you to respond to this demand

139
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,900
we're not recipient and it sounded the

140
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,900
booth

141
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:41,610
so this is quite a van Eco here I don't

142
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:45,180
have much to say when you hear that

143
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:50,780
figure 3.5 million jobs in three years

144
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:58,549
I don't think AI or robotics

[Music]

146
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:11,170
we're not receiving any sound at the

147
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:11,170
booth well you got that Oh No baseball

148
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:22,250
well this is like it's Inga the

149
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:23,870
technology positions that exists now not

150
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,980
the same future competitive cyber

151
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:31,129
security because cyber security is the

152
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:36,649
basis of our digital life now we have

153
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:41,389
IOT domotics everything is connected if

154
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:45,709
you don't have the foundations the basic

155
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:50,779
the base of cyber security our digital

156
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:53,300
lives are not safe now well living a

157
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:55,639
digital lie we have our smartphones with

158
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:00,579
us all the time we do everything through

159
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:03,970
apps everything we do in our daily live

160
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:09,290
working and detainment buying tickets

161
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:12,259
paying our purchases we do this through

162
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,790
smartphones and this should make us

163
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:20,600
think that cybersecurity is embedded in

164
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:27,589
any step we take every day and very

165
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:31,270
often you see us here but we're not old

166
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:32,500
we just started as a very early stage

[Music]

168
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,350
sometimes when we talk to young people

169
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:42,050
they tell us well cybersecurity the

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,600
event I have is well hackers in a

171
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:48,370
basement

172
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,700
with the hoodie eating pizza and we say

173
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:54,610
no sometimes you need to realize that

174
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,680
there are different profiles like ma has

175
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:03,070
explained before I'm an industrial

176
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:04,709
engineer we have people working with us

177
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,910
that come from the marketing world

178
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:13,300
criminology lawyers say cybersecurity is

179
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:17,469
cross-cutting and diverse and sometimes

180
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:20,920
people considered some something related

181
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,900
to freaks something this does not affect

182
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,969
me there's not improv an impact on me

183
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:28,780
but every time you access your computer

184
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:33,430
you've found you need to think about

185
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:35,709
cybersecurity and you don't just have

186
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:39,280
you can't be satisfied by being

187
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:41,320
self-taught you need to train train is

188
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,390
trading is pivotal because there are

189
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,090
many lines many profiles for

190
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:49,050
cybersecurity the hackers of course

191
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:51,850
which are widely known they're more

192
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,280
mediatic they have more impact in me the

193
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,010
other side for the cyber security

194
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,910
incident that make it to the news

195
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:04,030
related to hackers that's what the media

196
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:07,630
shows but there are a lot of people

197
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,750
behind that with the more technical work

198
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,750
marketing work foreign stick work

199
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,750
identifying

200
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:23,589
profiles of cyber criminals not just

201
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:27,550
from the standpoint of fighting against

202
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:30,220
criminals but also protecting criminals

203
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:35,410
every day when we connect we need to

204
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:39,190
take the basic measures not just us work

205
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:42,130
in cybersecurity it has to be in society

206
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:44,890
as a whole it's education at home with

207
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:49,980
our kids they need to know how to use

208
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:53,170
social media something as simple as

209
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:58,360
covering your webcam on your computer is

210
00:12:53,170 --> 00:13:02,790
very useful simple things that make us

211
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:09,880
safer in the digital lives were living

212
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:12,780
Selina I would like to thank you Siva

213
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,360
for inviting me I would like to thank

214
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:19,870
Madras for introducing me I would like

215
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:25,930
to tell you that if you see that we are

216
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:29,500
very familiar here on stage it's true

217
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:32,380
we are women and we explain what's going

218
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,360
on in the world of cyber security so

219
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,360
that you can have the opportunities you

220
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,580
deserve why am I saying this I'm going

221
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,430
to explain my personal experiences

222
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:47,290
retreat has said at the beginning the

223
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:50,130
data protection law changed my life back

224
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,130
in 2001

225
00:13:50,280 --> 00:14:01,449
lot 15 / 1999 had been ready enacted I

226
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:06,640
was a lawyer in a log cabin 8 regular

227
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:12,840
job as lawyer and I had the opportunity

228
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,840
to attend a talk by one of the main

229
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:21,900
persons relay man-made people related to

230
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,040
cybersecurity which is dr. Carlos Gallup

231
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:30,100
back then when I attend the conference

232
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:35,189
dr. Gallo spoke about a law and as a

233
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:41,560
lawyer I was used to hearing about

234
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:43,810
different piece of legislation but when

235
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,640
I was listening to him about the data

236
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:49,479
protection law I had a feeling that it

237
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:52,860
was not just any law for me was the law

238
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,860
of capitalist

239
00:14:55,309 --> 00:15:06,319
because when the legislature enacts a

240
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:09,540
law regarding blessing it's a trust to

241
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,469
very particular population people have

242
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,519
to do with ly6

243
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:16,799
if it's the law related to divorce well

244
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,109
this is address of people that are going

245
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,660
to divorce but this is not the case for

246
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:24,470
data protection law this piece of

247
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,219
legislation is addressed to any of us

248
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:32,790
natural persons

249
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:37,619
it protects basic right that actually

250
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:39,389
touched me as something there and it was

251
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:42,540
not until a few years later when I had

252
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:46,379
the opportunity to focus on new

253
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,608
technologies long and I did decided to

254
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,999
take the leap

255
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:54,029
as a matter of fact it was just studying

256
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:55,949
a different law in a different area

257
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:59,100
I had a possibility of working as a

258
00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:01,910
consultant of new technologies law in

259
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,739
order to apply data protection law and

260
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:07,410
there I started to work with colleagues

261
00:16:04,739 --> 00:16:10,319
who were had a technical profile IT

262
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,899
engineer and communication engineer who

263
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:18,149
spoke a different language I spoke the

264
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,890
legal language but we need to understand

265
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,760
each other

266
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:26,459
can you imagine how this was a lawyer

267
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:30,990
spin in sign language as an IT engineer

268
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:34,439
I was the weird person some sort of

269
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:39,300
translates between what law says that

270
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:42,180
the IT people could understand it as

271
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:45,569
well tree has said there was a while ago

272
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:50,430
and now I have a different

273
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:54,680
responsibility now I work in cyber

274
00:16:50,430 --> 00:17:00,899
security I'm in charge

275
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:05,549
business and cybersecurity of a Spanish

276
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:08,240
company called Seder it has offices in

277
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:12,959
more than 60 countries across the world

278
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,870
more than 30 offices at national level

279
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:22,829
more than 4,000 employees across the

280
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:24,958
world and in Spain were close to 2,500

281
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:28,260
and play years why am I saying this

282
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:32,610
because if you're sick in a job well I'm

283
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:35,360
offering jobs that's the reality the

284
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:38,178
reality we have is that we need

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:42,809

sure we'll have the opportunity to talk

299
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:36,629
because I'm the older in this front

300
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:39,408
table I can say that I have significant

301
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:45,119
experience so here there are very many

302
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:48,720
digital natives as well as other people

303
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:57,059
so in terms of needs that we have had in

304
00:18:48,720 --> 00:19:00,659
Siebel so it is very important to work

305
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:03,690
with everyone even with parents parents

306
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:08,999
that are members of parents associations

307
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:13,489
I am a native I'm cyber secure and as I

308
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:13,489
say I learned one of land

309
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:21,259
as I direction to go and as I say I was

310
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:25,820
about to become a doctor I wanted to

311
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:29,950
become a doctor and I decided to go to

312
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:34,100
the IT engineering school so we were

313
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:38,330
well I was the first promotion of IT

314
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:44,029
engineers here in Melaka and then as I

315
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:46,309
said there is no entry exam I've been in

316
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:49,100
Malaga since I was 2 years old

317
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:56,120
I consider myself to come from Malacca

318
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:59,649
and I come from

319
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,649
Milana so to speak and

320
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:15,810
when I graduated I was very passionate

321
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:18,450
for this topic and my colleagues I had

322
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:22,020
been studying a lot for the intrigue

323
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:24,720
some did not pass the exam and then

324
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,450
assess it as I said we were the first

325
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,640
promotion of IT engineers and then I

326
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,310
said okay I'm going to take this

327
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:41,370
opportunity I'm going to take this

328
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:45,270
opportunity and to go in the IT world so

329
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:48,419
I as I say it was very difficult for me

330
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:50,460
to go into the IT world security world

331
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,800
but once I discovered it and I could see

332
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:57,810
the huge opportunities in it I became

333
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:00,120
passionate about it so because

334
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:02,690
everything is related to cyber security

335
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,709
of very many things I'll give you very

336
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:12,240
real life example so you've seen the

337
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:14,820
debate about implants now these days of

338
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,520
well there is a civil side to it because

339
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,980
some implants will be mechanic will fail

340
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,470
because of their mechanics or sometimes

341
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,170
when implants fail there is a cyber

342
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,270
reason behind it because they are

343
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,070
connected nowadays everything is

344
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,560
connected everything that we use is

345
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:35,310
connected anything which is connected

346
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:40,020
has cyber security the resurvey security

347
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:43,139
behind it so the first book on the

348
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:48,690
dangers of the communication networks

349
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:51,870
and privacy so we tend to think that

350
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,020
data privacy law is a new law back in

351
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:57,010
the

352
00:21:53,020 --> 00:22:00,190
60 or the 70s

353
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,190
[Music]

354
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:10,749
has it lots of development and

355
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:13,809
advancement have we made ever since the

356
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:17,320
first time privacy in the networks was

357
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:23,289
discussed so everything is connected to

358
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:26,079
the internet our refrigerator

359
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:29,259
anything which is refrigerator and as I

360
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:32,769
say a mother can be a perfect

361
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:36,099
stakeholder to be recruited as a cyber

362
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:38,919
profile we all have accountability the

363
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:41,408
moment we buy a smartphone

364
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:46,299
I want a smartphone and I wanted to have

365
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:50,379
specific features so the cyber comes in

366
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:52,989
comes into play and we are all cyber at

367
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:57,599
the end of the day data protection no

368
00:22:52,989 --> 00:23:01,029
the new GRP t it's about data security

369
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:04,359
how we are going to build up protection

370
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:06,729
and then well the other panelist says

371
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:10,079
that data protection law changed her

372
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:13,389
life and also here we have to talk about

373
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,459
critical infrastructures so the

374
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:18,099
different terrorist attacks they also

375
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:25,209
were a breakthrough in terms of loss

376
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:27,458
average legislation to about security

377
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:32,639
one of the definitions given out by

378
00:23:27,459 --> 00:23:37,289
United Nations of cyber security is I

379
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:41,228
like very much this is defined us

380
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:47,589
Security's the well-being state that

381
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:50,319
individuals feel perceive and enjoy so

382
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:51,999
we organizations and entity all of us

383
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,799
working in the field of cyber security

384
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:59,199
we need to deliver that trust that

385
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:01,329
perception of to citizens

386
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:04,959
it isn't as when you come out to the

387
00:24:01,329 --> 00:24:08,820
streets you need to feel safe so we are

388
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:14,430
all cyber security cyber security

389
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:17,370
works at all levels and every any

390
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:19,800
studies that we do nowadays have the

391
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,830
cybersecurity side to them or

392
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,409
cybersecurity cross-sectional subjects I

393
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:28,710
would like to invite you to analyze and

394
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:31,290
to reflect upon any topic that you may

395
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:34,830
see around you they may see in the news

396
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:37,050
and there is cybersecurity side to

397
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:43,080
everything alright so we've been talking

398
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:45,990
about the different elements and they

399
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,909
are pointing at the same thing well we

400
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:53,070
should talk about professional profiles

401
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:55,110
and also skills and aptitudes that we

402
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,050
all need to have and that they are also

403
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,850
very important in the world of

404
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:02,040
cybersecurity

405
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:05,939
yes it's very interesting to talk about

406
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:09,000
cybersecurity profiles so here there is

407
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:12,180
room for any type of profile at the end

408
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,270
of the day all companies and need to

409
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:21,470
have experts to recruit resources we

410
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:23,460
also need experts in communication

411
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,160
journalists nowadays have the

412
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:31,110
opportunity to bring their knowledge and

413
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:33,560
know-how in line with cyber security for

414
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:38,459
instance when it comes to reporting

415
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:41,520
security breaches or reporting any other

416
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:47,520
type of incidents for instance I'm

417
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:50,430
talking about how news were posted when

418
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,990
our news are broadcast

419
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:58,280
whenever Facebook or any other company

420
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,640
suffers or is attacked so this is

421
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,149
nothing new

422
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,030
I'm as I say I'm talking about communic

423
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:08,310
profiles in the communication world but

424
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:12,690
now let us think about other profiles

425
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:15,389
that will also be needed

426
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:19,200
giving the example of psychologists and

427
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:22,320
linguists neuro linguists now are

428
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,779
working in line with artificial

429
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:32,009
intelligence psychologists philosophers

430
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:34,379
saikhan linguists will be needed at the

431
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:38,519
end of the day we have to bring ethics

432
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:40,498
in line with development of Robotics so

433
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:47,249
that at the end of the day the troubles

434
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:49,470
that are manufactured and not equipped

435
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:52,649
with an artificial intelligence that

436
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:55,080
will go crazy so we really need to have

437
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:59,609
different profiles different type of

438
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:03,239
people working in this field but we are

439
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:06,499
talking about profiles I would like to

440
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:09,359
refer to the need to have diverse

441
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:12,659
profiles we also wanted to talk about

442
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:13,559
diversity in this roundtable I'll give

443
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:17,909
you an example

444
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:21,210
we at Seder we have some four thousand

445
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:25,460
employees all over the world I could

446
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:29,479
tell you that we have two percent of

447
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:32,399
young people and two percent of senior

448
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:35,629
employees and the sinners are very

449
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:39,209
senior so we also have to work on that

450
00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:42,178
so that to look into the profiles that

451
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,279
we want to bring into our company so we

452
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,870
need to finance a bit find the balance

453
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,330
there

454
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:51,279
[Music]

455
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:56,210
when I was reflecting upon this topic I

456
00:27:51,279 --> 00:28:00,019
decided to talk there would be a good

457
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:02,720
idea of these type of soft skills these

458
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:06,289
type of skills for instance team working

459
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,559
and well this is not very these are not

460
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:18,789
very hard skills technical skills but

461
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:22,789
they also allow us to have but working

462
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:25,100
diverse teams and who cannot want a

463
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:28,929
disciplinary work we also talked about

464
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:33,738
artificial intelligence so we have also

465
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:37,639
would like to open the floor to

466
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:39,529
questions and answers so please take

467
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:43,969
that opportunity think about your

468
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:45,139
questions and well before we move on to

469
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,239
questions I'd like to say that

470
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:47,918
cybersecurity is sexy as well as very

471
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:50,419
cool

472
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,809
miserable says I work in cybersecurity

473
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:57,379
say oh wow are you a hacker no I'm not a

474
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:59,600
hacker and as we said before there are

475
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:00,709
very many stereotypes that will have to

476
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,709
do away with

477
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,389
so as Oliver says no in the attacker is

478
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,639
very important so therefore the

479
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:09,469
viewpoint of psychologists to find out

480
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:11,809
about who is the attacker what

481
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:14,299
personality is god that's a really good

482
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:16,460
point we also need economists to

483
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:18,980
convince our boss that it is necessary

484
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,399
to invest in service security will have

485
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:25,489
this is one of the most important roles

486
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,289
in cybersecurity it's not easy to

487
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:29,330
convince those who are in charge of

488
00:29:27,289 --> 00:29:31,279
deciding on investments that cyber

489
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,830
security investments is all the more

490
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:38,119
necessary and we'll have to open up this

491
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:39,830
field so the scenario is the cyber space

492
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:41,029
where we are all connected I'm not

493
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,570
talking about this baby we are talking

494
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:47,840
about Chinese Americans Russians Lincoln

495
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:49,879
that is a game as we said before and I

496
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,769
don't want to refer to it as a war of

497
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:57,049
game sorry a war game and at the end of

498
00:29:54,769 --> 00:30:00,889
the day we have taken this to reality

499
00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:05,330
and we can see them in real life and

500
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:09,860
professional profiles have to be broad

501
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:13,120
and diverse no years compete working in

502
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:16,149
marketing to sell the cybersecurity

503
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,699
product they have to be economists

504
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:23,750
psychologists doctors we have talked

505
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,950
here about replacements and in fact you

506
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:30,559
can remotely control a pacemaker and

507
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:34,100
actually brand that we will not be

508
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:38,990
naming here had their insulin pumps

509
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:41,860
attacked and well the world is open the

510
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:44,840
world is open to endless possibilities

511
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,689
and we are talking about his skills it's

512
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:51,019
very important to know how to translate

513
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:55,629
the technical language how many of you

514
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:55,629
have a technical profile who

515
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:05,900
okay you are not technicians who have

516
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:10,260
not received that technical training

517
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:13,560
well you technicians should use the

518
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:17,520
language that we those of us were not

519
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:20,280
technicians can follow I've been

520
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,060
learning throughout my life what

521
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:28,649
cybersecurity is about value technicians

522
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:31,320
need to know how to explain to those who

523
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:33,540
are not technicians what do you do what

524
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:39,360
is necessary to invest in what you do

525
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:46,080
and why your time is of so much value

526
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:49,709
and now I would like to share three

527
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,710
messages takeaway messages first cyber

528
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:56,160
security is diverse second cyber

529
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:59,660
security is responsibility of us all and

530
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,670
then to work in cyber security you need

531
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:06,690
significant training lots of training it

532
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:09,930
is very interesting of course to self

533
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:12,450
teach yourself and to have lots of

534
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:15,750
curiosity parents of that you need

535
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:19,640
training you need education and yes you

536
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:23,130
need to have the curiosity curiosity is

537
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:26,690
extremely its crucial and it is very

538
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:28,560
easy nowadays to fill our curiosity

539
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:32,910
because we have lots of information

540
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:37,250
about the internet but as I say training

541
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:37,250
also very very important

542
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,650
[Music]

543
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:49,649
so the global level we need all type of

544
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:56,310
profiles but we also need significant

545
00:32:49,650 --> 00:33:02,040
well with specialization I don't know

546
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:05,010
whether you are being trained in IT

547
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:10,730
security how many of you are studying IT

548
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:17,560
security how many of you are in between

549
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:19,520
development development of Java websites

550
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,379
[Music]

551
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,950
have you been told about the secure

552
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:30,270
funds for each language programming

553
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:33,090
language that you know secure functions

554
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:40,860
who is aware of secure funds so a

555
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:44,810
secured function edit prevent you by

556
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:49,020
being but not being attacked by the

557
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:52,490
vulnerabilities over for not having an

558
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:56,370
SQL injection you should finish your

559
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:59,700
strain with an asterisk okay have you

560
00:33:56,370 --> 00:34:02,370
been taught that have you learned are

561
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:06,260
you ok as I say lots of a specialization

562
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:10,080
so in the future we will need

563
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:13,440
specialists in development a specialist

564
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,690
in forensics specialist in hacking so

565
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,150
you need to have like an overall vision

566
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,880
but at the same at the end of the day

567
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:24,420
people will be highly specialized the

568
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,920
Philosopher's the psychologists all

569
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,110
these profiles will be mirrored in

570
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,250
service security with this I mean that

571
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:35,880
cyber security is open to everyone

572
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:36,829
so also managing uncertainty we don't

573
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,579
know who

574
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:43,279
we'll be facing up okay so therefore

575
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:47,749
we'll have to be creative in terms of

576
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:50,978
how to respond to the attackers - we

577
00:34:47,748 --> 00:34:53,268
also have to be to welcome our

578
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:57,558
creativity also lateral thinking

579
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:59,508
out-of-the-box thinking well Marge you

580
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:01,339
are very good at explaining that lateral

581
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:02,390
thinking out-of-the-box thinking we'll

582
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:04,519
have to be creative

583
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:07,038
well lateral attacks you are aware of

584
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:12,519
tired of lateral attacks well that

585
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:12,519
should be contracted by lateral thinking

586
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:26,839
now we are talking about going out of

587
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:30,019
the box I do not worry you were in the

588
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:37,910
of the last Winter Olympic Games in

589
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:41,328
China not sleep who was from the US and

590
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:42,229
then she became Turkish to take part in

591
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:46,609
Tallaght games

592
00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:51,098
her name was Elizabeth strain her story

593
00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:53,959
is a very interesting story because she

594
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:57,160
was obsessed with taking part in the

595
00:35:53,959 --> 00:36:03,589
Olympic Games but she had a problem

596
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:08,569
Winter Olympic Games and well often well

597
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:10,549
skiing is one of the sports and what she

598
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:17,719
didn't know how to ski and what did she

599
00:36:10,549 --> 00:36:21,979
do to fulfill her dream well she started

600
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:26,809
learning and then she produced the plan

601
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:29,269
and to see what she needed to end up in

602
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:31,219
the Winter Olympic Games and according

603
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:33,348
to the regulations one of the

604
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:36,019
requirements was having taken parts in

605
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:39,979
other competitions for her to get a

606
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:42,258
score she was to her that a scorer in

607
00:36:39,979 --> 00:36:45,049
those competitions where there were less

608
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:47,230
than 30 women participating in it and

609
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:50,120
she looked up for those competitions

610
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:53,900
with less than 30 women in them she used

611
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:57,500
to join those competitions and then to

612
00:36:53,900 --> 00:37:01,130
get the scores or that she needed or the

613
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:03,980
points that she needed and then she sum

614
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:06,620
up all those that is Kareem and then in

615
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:09,620
the end she ends up being the person in

616
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:12,680
Hungary with the highest number of

617
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,630
points and then she ended up in China in

618
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,569
the Winter Olympic Games do you know

619
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:20,510
what she did well that is in YouTube and

620
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:23,660
in the end she took part in the

621
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:28,190
competition and she was bending okay she

622
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:30,080
could not stand a pair of skis and then

623
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:33,140
well because that didn't say in the

624
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:36,080
regulations okay she just ensured that

625
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:40,190
he would take part in the competition so

626
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:43,730
what she did was thinking out of the box

627
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:46,460
this is the way we should think in cyber

628
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:49,880
security because the situation's we end

629
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:52,340
up facing are tremendously unexpected

630
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,990
when we are managing events attackers do

631
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,850
not let us know oh look I'm going to

632
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:58,580
look for the back to Iran because you've

633
00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:01,100
got a vulnerability they don't know that

634
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:03,950
you not tell us about that so therefore

635
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,799
this is the reality that we face so

636
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:09,740
therefore had skills such as know-how

637
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,990
knowledge and English English language

638
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:14,750
careful English is widely used in

639
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:17,959
cybersecurity are the skills of perfect

640
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:20,750
women welcome that they are all the time

641
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,900
needed however soft skills are

642
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,670
tremendously important to me which is

643
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,240
the most importance of the skill of

644
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:30,710
communication and why because in

645
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,299
cybersecurity where we are managing

646
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:36,270
events well you do not only have

647
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:38,010
well with your member members of your

648
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:40,320
team also with the management of your

649
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,510
company and also coordination and in

650
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:47,130
collaboration with other national or

651
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:50,340
international teams the first o-silk

652
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:53,340
network started of us to fulfill the

653
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:55,520
need of managing incidents in the best

654
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:59,700
possible manner and as I say

655
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:03,360
communication empathy cooperation they

656
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:06,930
are essentials of the skills and then of

657
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:12,000
Kerswell being sympathetic working with

658
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:16,109
teams all right so we would like to open

659
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,590
the floor to questions and well before

660
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:23,520
that I'd like to mention the following

661
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:27,480
topic one of the five one of the things

662
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:31,920
that you'd like you to take away is that

663
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:35,730
security is not exclusive of it's not a

664
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:39,650
world of fur of men and for men when I

665
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:43,260
went to university well there were ten

666
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:46,110
women and we were surrounded by very

667
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,080
many women volunteer beginning it seemed

668
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:52,500
okay our colleague has told us that when

669
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:57,299
she went to the IT school and there were

670
00:39:52,500 --> 00:40:00,840
50% women are 50% men then later on I

671
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:04,280
went back to university and then the

672
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,280
percentage of women had

673
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:12,759
those schools haven't reduced

674
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:15,009
dramatically so Pedro Sanchez Cordero

675
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:20,910
has a wonderful presentation this

676
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:24,819
afternoon Cuckoo's egg I recommend you

677
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:27,239
attend his presentation is very very

678
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:27,239
very good

679
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:36,880
I've always been following ongoing

680
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:41,049
training so federal census Cordero

681
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,880
is one of the best in the world you will

682
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:45,729
have the opportunity to check that by

683
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,630
yourself this afternoon he has also been

684
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:52,868
attached teacher in one of the latest

685
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:55,660
Martin's courses that I followed when I

686
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:57,729
said when I went to the IT school 50%

687
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:01,118
women 50% men and now you are teaching

688
00:40:57,729 --> 00:41:03,189
at the AG school how many women what is

689
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,259
the percentage of women well in my

690
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:08,560
master's course a master's course where

691
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:14,680
I teach there is only one woman

692
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,680
[Music]

693
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:23,210
Syme all the time learning I've trained

694
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:26,630
myself all my life but as I say I'm not

695
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:30,050
seeing very many women recently getting

696
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:35,440
trained in cyber security service even

697
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:35,440
has a firm on cybersecurity and gender

698
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:43,060
and country that's why we are making a

699
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:47,300
significant effort from different women

700
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:54,860
associations to promote participation of

701
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:56,720
women in cyber security so that women

702
00:41:54,860 --> 00:42:00,170
understand that this is a fascinating

703
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:04,549
world that there is a significant future

704
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:09,710
head and we through technology can build

705
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:14,390
a better world and actually here today

706
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:20,060
at Malaga we had the recent event known

707
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:22,910
as women challenge with 1,500 women from

708
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:25,790
Spain this is an event aimed at

709
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:28,100
promoting the participation of women in

710
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:33,710
the world of technology then very many

711
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:39,220
women here but please pass that

712
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:44,380
information on to your friends to your

713
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:47,319
relatives and to please pass on you

714
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:52,100
passion about cybersecurity and

715
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:57,850
technology to them so service security

716
00:42:52,100 --> 00:43:01,940
by design that's a fascinating topic so

717
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:05,000
all of us here are in love with

718
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:08,000
cybersecurity we would like to have more

719
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,340
more people more women interested in

720
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,120
working and contributing to the world of

721
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,120
cybersecurity

722
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:24,578
well hopefully next year there will be

723
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:27,079
not only five of us but thirty of us so

724
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:29,230
time for questions we have two more

725
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:29,230
minutes

726
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:50,650
come on don't be shy all right there is

727
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:50,649
a question there hello

728
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:03,830
we are students from the system's cycle

729
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,830
of vocational training on systems

730
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:09,758
so what will be the itinerary that we

731
00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:14,349
should follow we are just ordinary

732
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:19,899
students so we are not wealthy we cannot

733
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:21,729
really afford 5000 euro training course

734
00:44:19,899 --> 00:44:24,659
what is the itinerary that we should

735
00:44:21,729 --> 00:44:27,299
follow well that's a wonderful question

736
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:35,499
it's a really really good question very

737
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:38,619
approaching and so I really like to

738
00:44:35,499 --> 00:44:40,299
answer these type of questions who here

739
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:43,319
will have colleagues from community

740
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:46,089
groups which is community group is

741
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:49,119
companies we have from Malaga they have

742
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:53,828
an educational itinerary offering 204

743
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:56,289
training courses with 35 labs so we know

744
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:59,559
that theory is not the only thing that

745
00:44:56,289 --> 00:45:02,799
we need we also need to practice to put

746
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:06,039
things in practice to make sure that you

747
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:08,499
are ready to face up to the attacks that

748
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:12,119
you may be receiving and now if you

749
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:12,118
visit their websites

750
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:22,420
so you will get access to all the

751
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:25,359
training courses that we offer we are

752
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:28,240
also working with San Pablo fellow and

753
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:32,710
Polytechnic College University we are

754
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:36,790
offering our courses on ethical hacking

755
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:42,099
and others we don't only train people

756
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:45,910
and red teaming and on the actual

757
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:49,810
hacking work but as I say we are

758
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:54,279
offering a technical itinerary to work

759
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:58,930
in communications in networks as a basis

760
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:02,740
to basic training suitcase further

761
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:06,940
specialized so you may discuss that with

762
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:10,629
Antonio Lopez and Tony Lopez his company

763
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:12,460
from Malaga and we are very happy to

764
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:16,720
work with them because we strongly

765
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:20,260
believe in training and education so

766
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,410
regarding training because self teach

767
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:26,020
myself well many occasions I had to pay

768
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:29,529
for my training other occasions called

769
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:32,460
my training paid and well there are very

770
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:36,430
many training courses online of an

771
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:42,450
organization offers training well those

772
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:42,450
of you who work in systems so systems

773
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:47,410
[Music]

774
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:49,950
when we are talking about systems ok

775
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,950
well

776
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:55,299
contained 50% security I don't know

777
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,940
whether you have been trained on

778
00:46:55,299 --> 00:47:00,009
security or not obviously lots of

779
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,910
training the same as in female offers

780
00:47:00,009 --> 00:47:07,390
manuals best practices and it has a long

781
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:14,828
list of masters courses they are all

782
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:17,859
different they are all on cyber security

783
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:21,130
as I said for my training for my

784
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:23,739
education is very interesting but we

785
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,989
should not forget about soft skills and

786
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:28,509
then common-sense the common sense that

787
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:30,729
you need to work in cyber security we

788
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:33,759
already have that and then we have to

789
00:47:30,729 --> 00:47:38,430
apply know how to apply it there is lots

790
00:47:33,759 --> 00:47:42,910
of training and well free training and

791
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:46,839
out there which we can take a very good

792
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:50,709
advantage of so we Ayrton Siva we are

793
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:52,779
strongly supporting talent Cybercom is

794
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:54,788
one of the proofs of that this is the

795
00:47:52,779 --> 00:47:58,569
fifth edition of our summer camp the

796
00:47:54,789 --> 00:48:01,900
idea is to identify talent and to help

797
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:05,640
you out from us from a public company

798
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,640
specializing in cyber security

799
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,950
we would like to help you find the

800
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,080
education and training itinerary that

801
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:18,439
you need we also have an improvement

802
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:21,860
forum also lifelong training workshops

803
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:25,850
competitions but it is very important

804
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:28,190
when the phrases for all targets younger

805
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:30,529
people all the people because at the end

806
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,510
of the day this is a global topic

807
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,880
security cyber security is not a

808
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:38,770
trending topic anymore it is a real need

809
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:43,910
that affects us all

810
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:46,580
so actually we should this give to cyber

811
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:50,149
security the treatment it deserves we

812
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:52,279
should all be well aware of what happens

813
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:56,390
with some security and the connected

814
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:59,470
world where we live and well other than

815
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:02,960
the education and training itinerary

816
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:05,089
itinerary search do not forget about

817
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,750
becoming an analyst and researching and

818
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:11,000
reading a lot ok do not forget to read

819
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:15,650
about what is happening in the world

820
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,450
after curiosity fuel that curiosity well

821
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:22,160
other than the interest that you may

822
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:28,160
having following formal training and

823
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:30,680
education by learning you can learn by

824
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,450
reading you can learn a lot read and

825
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,549
read and read and research and research

826
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:39,649
and also take advantage of the

827
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:41,930
communities communities of developers so

828
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:45,140
do not limit yourself to formal

829
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:47,129
education only go beyond there come out

830
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,129
of the box

831
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:52,890
[Music]

832
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:57,020
so all the progress that I made in this

833
00:49:52,890 --> 00:50:00,330
field is because anything that was new I

834
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,680
got trained on that if no one wanted to

835
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:05,299
get training on that I always

836
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,299
volunteered to be trained

837
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:18,310
well now what do companies look for in

838
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,310
terms of profiles

839
00:50:21,369 --> 00:50:29,380
my companies have needed to fulfill

840
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:33,808
vacancies were well either because we

841
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:41,170
are growing our business because we are

842
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:46,930
offering more services and what we do

843
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:50,969
have is like internal its inner area

844
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:55,479
internal training itinerary for our

845
00:50:50,969 --> 00:50:58,420
stuff through our personnel so the

846
00:50:55,479 --> 00:51:01,629
people that we hire are required to have

847
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:04,390
basic knowledge basic know-how that is

848
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:06,460
to say hard skills and then once a

849
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:09,460
person is in the company we work with

850
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:13,109
the person so that the person knows how

851
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:17,920
to work in a team and we work a lot in

852
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:21,729
soft skills so for instance I follow

853
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,849
training on teamwork conflict management

854
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:26,468
and many of these things that are many

855
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:28,900
of these soft skills that are very

856
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:31,960
important in cybersecurity once we have

857
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:37,269
hired personnel and as I say we produce

858
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:41,859
that in that training itinerary and how

859
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:44,019
do we do that well by specific training

860
00:51:41,859 --> 00:51:46,660
or for instance I do not propose into

861
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:50,890
other stuff to get international

862
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:51,489
certifications or well diploma as as

863
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,190
needed

864
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:56,759
any other questions in the room well no

865
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,759
more questions

866
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:05,690
so me I'd like to say

867
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:12,110
that for more advanced profiles or even

868
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:15,890
beginners profiles we are our platforms

869
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:20,600
we offer the possibility to produce and

870
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:23,690
I'd seen early based on an Aes this is

871
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:29,810
what Secretary of Defense in Department

872
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:31,730
of Defense in u.s. use so you enter your

873
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:34,430
skills to debilitate your knowledge and

874
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:40,000
based on all these questionnaires that

875
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:42,500
you'll fill out when you create a

876
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,810
profile for yourself then you can

877
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:51,140
produce and training itinerary that best

878
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:54,350
suit the cybersecurity profile where you

879
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:57,049
are or where you want to be so this is a

880
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:59,930
nice very good way to start

881
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:03,020
so that is tells you where you are and

882
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:05,779
then you can project where you want to

883
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:07,520
do so then you decide whether you want

884
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:10,520
to become a hacker or that you want to

885
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,790
be in the red team you name it all right

886
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:16,310
so I would like to finish I would like

887
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,630
to thank our four speakers who sing a

888
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:21,890
