217
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:26,740
2018 over these four days Malaga has

218
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:29,020
became the capital city in the world of

219
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,620
cybersecurity people from Malaga and

220

228
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:56,440
unstoppable more and more people become

229
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,840
increasingly interested in these events

230

232
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,740
