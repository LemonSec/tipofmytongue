2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:22,410
well thank you very much I would like to

3
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,360
thank the people present here and all

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,079
the people watching our streaming and

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,230
more particularly my team in smart fence

6
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:32,640
this was drawn by my cousin Franco I

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:41,219
would like to thank him for his

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:46,949
collaboration my talk it's going to be

9
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:50,940
informal this is some advice I could

10
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:53,579
give you in case it's useful for you if

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,199
you want to be entrepreneurs who you

12
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,749
want to work in cybersecurity oh you

13
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,839
want to want the cyber ventures which is

14
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:04,530
what brings me here we're going to speak

15
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:07,550
about cyber security there's and

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:12,840
fulfills demand when it comes to

17
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:15,658
professionals well then we're going to

18
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,479
speak about how to how to be an

19
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,780
entrepreneur in cybersecurity then we're

20
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,579
going to be about the path I took and

21
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,890
modern threats and how that made us

22
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:31,199
create our company smart offense and

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,009
then I'm going to explain the

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,950
methodology called MQ SP which can only

25
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,759
be found in this talk I'm a system

26
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:46,020
engineer I graduated in Argentina I'm 39

27
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,450
years old and this is my fifth start-up

28
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,908
within cybersecurity say I'm going to

29
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:58,640
focus on that I am CEO of my company I

30
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,640
was the CEO of my previous startups

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:07,820
we've received the award of the company

32
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:12,019
acceleration program by in CV which will

33
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:16,400
be awarded in next edition so let's talk

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,890
about the demand and possibility career

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,790
possibilities all of you I could show

36
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,440
you statistics which are true but I

37
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,150
think that we need to look at this in

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,760
practical terms what happened to me I'm

39
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,920
from Argentina a small city San

40
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,500
Francisco near coral there were 60,000

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,470
inhabitants and when I came here to take

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,620
part in this acceleration program I met

43
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:42,020
many people like entman remember the

44
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,720
face is there hundreds of people I was

45
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:50,150
so fortunate it was very useful but when

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:54,820
I went back no one I went back to

47
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,820
Argentina then four months I came back

48
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,950
everybody was working somewhere else

49
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,320
even within in see me what happened

50
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:09,579
there's a lot of movement a lot of

51
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:12,500
demand a different job positions don't I

52
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,890
had a nice surprise the contacts that I

53
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,350
had had were useful for me in the new

54
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:22,429
position so what I want to say is please

55
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:24,920
be reassured if you hear you're doing

56
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,900
your homework you've chosen a career

57
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,899
with a big demand

58
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:38,599
I think I'm too short so I'm never going

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:43,590
to cover the slides this is my how-to

60
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:46,649
the one I used it wasn't written before

61
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,340
I did it this is my experience so that

62
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,370
you can use it but more particularly is

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,230
like any book you really took something

64
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,090
that's useful and if it's not useful I

65
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,369
don't use it because this is what my

66
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:02,489
path it doesn't mean it has to be yours

67
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:08,280
so I studied I worked I looked for a

68
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:10,200
problem I checked that it existed and

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,440
once a promise says you look for

70
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,459
competitors and local partners and then

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:22,979
you start so this how to is order to

72
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:26,880
create the startup so we speak about

73
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:29,880
studying by studying at national

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:34,610
technological university it's a specific

75
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,610
University food engineering studies

76
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,029
[Music]

77
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,979
so by means of a university degree which

78
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,699
is my first message I would advise you

79
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:54,280
to study to get in versity degree I

80
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:56,680
graduated when I was 23 quite early and

81
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,830
I compared the definition of creativity

82
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,280
and engineering on the top side you're

83
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,340
going to see creativity and below

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,619
engineering the first thing in

85
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:14,169
creativity its creation and engineering

86
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:16,960
is invention then creativity is new and

87
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,359
dynamic elements and engineering takes

88
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,940
about innovation their creativity

89
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,889
problem-solving and engineering model is

90
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:29,770
the same thing this comes from Wikipedia

91
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:33,759
so you see here we say limited resource

92
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:36,039
in both cases mental potential and in

93
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,180
engineering the same thing knowledge and

94
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:43,180
with regards to solutions right

95
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,590
solutions or something practical what do

96
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:49,539
I mean by this this is just one

97
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:53,318
characteristics I'm trying to point out

98
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:56,318
which is characteristics but in the

99
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,569
definition of engineering you see

100
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,180
there's so much that's what we engineers

101
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:05,740
do we solve problems in a creative way

102
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:09,130
how this is how you can you study a

103
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,610
degree and you get a bias towards the

104
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:19,029
abilities you need for being an

105
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:23,110
entrepreneur this is my fifth startup

106
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:24,969
the full one was outlet 25 I'm not in

107
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:28,270
those projects anymore but they're still

108
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:30,789
ongoing I get bored I create the company

109
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:34,568
I develop it and when it gets table I

110
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:37,479
get bored and I leave I acknowledge this

111
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:41,580
is my character it's a virtue and also a

112
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:45,870
negative aspect this element I think

113
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:48,870
develops specific causes for technical

114
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,870
profiles

115
00:06:48,989 --> 00:07:00,399
but I want to show you with all these is

116
00:06:53,499 --> 00:07:02,830
that how why we created this because in

117
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:06,279
Latin America we didn't have the same

118
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,929
course offering as in Spain so I would

119
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:12,369
like to invite you to take a look at

120
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:14,948
this so let's move on to our next steps

121
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:17,349
we've studied we have the basis but he

122
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:20,229
never stopped studying you never stop

123
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:22,019
reading attending conferences that

124
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:24,248
should never end

125
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:29,319
but let's go to next step which is

126
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:32,800
working I'm going to stop here for a

127
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:35,079
while you need to be flexible you don't

128
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,009
need to work in cybersecurity in a

129
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:41,789
specific position about what you studied

130
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,079
you're so specific about something and

131
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:45,219
right from the beginning you studied

132
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,949
something very particular because

133
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:49,989
perhaps you may work for something which

134
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:52,539
is nothing to do with cybersecurity but

135
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:54,849
it's a better environment in order to be

136
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,709
an entrepreneur in cybersecurity if you

137
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,209
want to be an entrepreneur you need to

138
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:03,849
detect many things you need to be

139
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:05,919
curious so if you work in something very

140
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:09,009
particular if a company is that you're

141
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,558
very good at something they're going to

142
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:14,800
request it to be better that you're

143
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:19,149
going to have more expertise but in just

144
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:24,729
one field you're not going to have a

145
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:26,469
general view so it's ok to work in a

146
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,589
position which is not necessarily a

147
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:32,708
specialist in cybersecurity because you

148
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:34,719
need to look for problems and in order

149
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:37,468
to be able to look for problems you need

150
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,469
to work

151
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,459
so you don't need to work for a very

152
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:54,620
specific company in the cybersecurity

153
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:58,640
world when it comes to looking for a

154
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:01,220
problem I want to change this because I

155
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,380
wasn't looking for a problem I was in

156
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,740
the right environment in order to

157
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,960
identify problems if I ask if you

158
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:15,920
consider yourself curious please raise

159
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:18,110
your hand if you think you're curious

160
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,270
raise one hand if you're considered

161
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,270
you're very curious raise both hands

162
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:31,700
what curious could be about food I came

163
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:36,050
from Argentina with Nikolas we've tried

164
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:38,650
everything what was it this al Morocco

165
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:43,670
version he will we've forgotten the name

166
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:45,620
that's what's left for us to try you're

167
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,900
not curious in just one field you're

168
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,780
curious about everything and in this

169
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:54,199
particular case when it comes to

170
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:59,000
identifying the problem as long as you

171
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:02,230
have a contact contacts from everywhere

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,880
it will be more likely that you find

173
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,800
problems from different nature the more

174
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,200
places you've worked at the more

175
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,630
possibilities you have to identify

176
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,580
problems to be solved there are problems

177
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,550
everywhere if you say that everything

178
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,400
has been discovered well that means

179
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:22,969
you're not in the mood you're not in the

180
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,850
mood for looking for problems then you

181
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,460
validate that it exists that's the big

182
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,510
problem engineers face as soon as you

183
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,000
know like to ask you

184
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:39,180
who has studied or is going to study

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:45,269
degree related to IT or engineering so

186
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:53,699
you graduated what was the big problem

187
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:56,459
of loving the problem sometimes the

188
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,349
problem has been invented its invented

189
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,760
because we have the solution we like

190
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,740
wait there's something we've developed

191
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,720
or we want to develop and then we invent

192
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:10,410
a problem that's going to be solved with

193
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:13,019
the thing so we invest a lot of time to

194
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,480
solve a problem which we don't know if

195
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:18,180
it exists or no so we need to validate

196
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:24,570
their problem exists it might sound

197
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:27,269
silly but it happens very frequently I'm

198
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:31,350
going to recommend a true that was

199
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:36,690
useful for us this was my fav startup so

200
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:38,970
what happened the first stages I was

201
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:42,870
blind forwarded I wanted to be an

202
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:45,569
entrepreneur because my parents dated my

203
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,250
grandparents did I just changed field

204
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:50,630
they worked in bored

205
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,630
I work in cybersecurity

206
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,020
the positive thing I had and I didn't

207
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,600
realize it back then it was I never had

208
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:04,520
money I started from scratch because

209
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:07,400
every startup I created I did it with

210
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:11,710
very little money the first time I did

211
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:14,150
it by myself the second I had found

212
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,330
books and entrepreneurship now they're

213
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:20,720
accelerators incubators everything I've

214
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,120
just finished an accelerating problem

215
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,550
too

216
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,680
several years ago I was an incubator in

217
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:33,829
the past there was nothing no one helped

218
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:36,050
you so the complicated thing was knowing

219
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:40,670
whether the thing you were solving was

220
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:44,479
solved in the right way how could we

221
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:50,959
know by trying Christina from continuum

222
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:53,720
says we have methodology called lean

223
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:58,630
startup

224
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,630
have you heard about it Lean Startup

225
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:04,370
you're going to be entrepreneurs I

226
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:11,300
recommend this as a methodology does

227
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:15,470
that why it's useful that we didn't do

228
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:18,790
anything that Intel spending out of

229
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:22,670
money or a lot of time without solving a

230
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:27,140
problem I did learn that the fifth

231
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:30,740
problem in the previous startups I was

232
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:33,949
doing with that partially what's the

233
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,350
origin of this methodology you have to

234
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:39,380
bear in mind and in the u.s. very often

235
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:43,070
there was an idea and immediately there

236
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:45,189
was money behind it to help that

237
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:48,530
entrepreneur Norden to develop that idea

238
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:51,490
but very often then pays money they

239
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,350
funded a problem that did not exist so

240
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,440
in Lean Startup are going to find a

241
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:01,220
methodology which is useful to invest

242
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,490
this lesson as possible until we move

243
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:09,160
forward and up to a certain degree

244
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:14,019
first of all in hypothesis you have the

245
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:17,969
by hypothesis a specific problem exists

246
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:23,670
then we need the Minimum Viable Product

247
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:29,889
it was a software in our case our MVP

248
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:32,800
was just sheets of paper and then we

249
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:41,050
explained where we what we were going to

250
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:43,479
do and the funny thing is that we were

251
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:50,290
going to find investors with a sheet of

252
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:53,019
paper and we saw that sometimes your and

253
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:59,079
a lot of project that's what you want to

254
00:14:53,019 --> 00:15:02,410
avoid with this style we want to look

255
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:04,089
for investors and we realized that

256
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,610
people were interested in us but that

257
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:10,329
they had no money we had just a sheet of

258
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:14,640
paper that had nothing so very often you

259
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:14,640
need to take things with calm

260
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,189
the software was like this you could see

261
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,559
it there were many parts of it were with

262
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:27,929
you touched and nothing happened

263
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:27,929
or it was a failure software quality

264
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,749
what's the point in having a good

265
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:37,959
quality software if it doesn't solve any

266
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:40,389
problem that's the goal of lean startup

267
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,449
once we validate the problem exists we

268
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:46,259
need to look for competitors I'm going

269
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:46,258
to ask you

270
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:55,220
who is with a specific who is working

271
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:59,480
with a specific product or a specific

272
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,730
company is someone an entrepreneur are

273
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,980
trying to be of course you don't have

274
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:09,559
competitors because you are not

275
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:13,370
entrepreneurs the problem I had in each

276
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:17,809
of the startups is that I fell in love

277
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:18,769
with my products so when I looked

278
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:21,259
somewhere else

279
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,059
I was looking this way because I didn't

280
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:27,290
want to see competitors I had identified

281
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:28,430
a problem my solution solved it but I

282
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:34,579
didn't want to know whether there was

283
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:38,739
another one that solved it so I was the

284
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:41,329
right person to identify a competitor

285
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,999
other people were telling me have

286
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:48,258
competitors here there and but they

287
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:50,689
didn't know they didn't know because

288
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:55,249
they were not in my field and I was the

289
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:59,029
only one who could say it and I didn't

290
00:16:55,249 --> 00:17:00,679
want to see that you know every startup

291
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:04,599
there were many more competitors and

292
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:04,599
identify them in at a later stage

293
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:13,579
very often we want to protect her idea

294
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:16,270
so much that we don't go was word to

295
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,270
look for things

296
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:27,019
you have to change your mindset but it

297
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:30,649
has to do with what I said in the

298
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:32,510
beginning being curious you need to go

299
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,668
out there and look for competitors

300
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:38,179
having competitors is a good thing you

301
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:41,870
may be afraid but my competitor offers

302
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:44,090
the possibility of copying him or her

303
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:48,018
and then the certainty that if there's

304
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:50,750
someone that's a competitor that means

305
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:53,059
our problem exists that validates our

306
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:58,909
problem I'm not the only one that thinks

307
00:17:53,059 --> 00:18:03,470
that problem exists I'm reading two

308
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:05,840
books at the same time about erosion

309
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,700
strategies which is about looking for

310
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,330
something that doesn't exist I'm not

311
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:15,169
saying you not to it but very often

312
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:19,010
looking for something disruptive it

313
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:21,409
means that you looking sometimes you're

314
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:24,070
looking for a problem which does not

315
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:24,070
even exist

316
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,280
the other big challenge I had was

317
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,920
looking for partners and I would like to

318
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,649
give you a recommendation please don't

319
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:42,200
think of yourself as a big startup I

320
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:44,690
changed partners in every startup and I

321
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,340
don't have any bad relationship with any

322
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,590
of the previous ones some of them were

323
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,790
the same ones what I'm trying to say is

324
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,409
that throughout your life you're going

325
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:55,040
to find different partners I will be

326
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:57,470
useful for different time so please

327
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,510
don't get crazy about finding the right

328
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:04,550
partner for each case having said that

329
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,000
which has to do with being an

330
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:10,370
entrepreneur let's move on to specific

331
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,710
characteristics of smart fence we have

332
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:16,639
three ways of achieving the same result

333
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:19,910
in this case was the question of some

334
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:24,950
people not easily within cyber security

335
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:30,380
I want to hack someone's facebook

336
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:33,830
account before being discovered all my

337
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:36,790
cousins asked me about this they want to

338
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,790
do something like this

339
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:43,580
in most of those sides they're going to

340
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:48,320
hack one account which is going to be

341
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:51,050
yours the first thing I went to ask the

342
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,960
little requires its information about

343
00:19:51,050 --> 00:20:00,490
your account but that's level one I want

344
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:05,960
to hack and i hack 127 zero zero one

345
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:10,130
number two I reached this level which is

346
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:12,920
I consider myself a hacker now it's a

347
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:16,160
cyber criminal I consider myself a

348
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:21,890
hacker but instead what I was doing just

349
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:23,930
looking for software in order to hack

350
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:27,710
and I used them without knowing would

351
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:34,940
indeed and I thought I was hiking

352
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:37,780
someone else and I was being hacked this

353
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:42,570
made me think that this was too easy

354
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:45,649
without having knowledge

355
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:51,509
I realized that I could achieve a result

356
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:53,939
hack and achieving a result with a talk

357
00:20:51,509 --> 00:21:00,149
which was something very simple and it

358
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:04,399
exists again you could try this if you

359
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:07,168
wanted easy to do and the third level

360
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:09,739
that I didn't get to is to devote

361
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:14,669
specific time time enough to generate

362
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:19,049
vulnerabilities were to develop relevant

363
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:21,990
tools or you can also use others to

364
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:24,870
achieve your objective so here we are

365
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,809
super Bosch 11 office cyber criminal

366
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:30,989
wants to develop a tool to make a profit

367
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:33,809
and then the web law so we get keepers

368
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:37,500
intermediaries also used for that

369
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:40,799
phishing attack so these are the attacks

370
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,289
that we detected that is to say those

371
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,590
people that with little knowledge could

372
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:49,950
do little or nothing and those with

373
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:53,789
medium level of knowledge could carry

374
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:56,149
out or launch like medium size so to

375
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:58,620
speak

376
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:01,799
minimal scale attacks and then those

377
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:04,979
with good knowledge that the good pretty

378
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:09,360
large highly severe attacks so what we

379
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,519
have seen here also is that the security

380
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,219
officers were receiving very many

381
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,320
attacks anything that was not protected

382
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,080
through firewalls or three anything the

383
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,360
attack when she has a bright way into

384
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,960
the organization just through sending it

385
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,840
an email with an attached file and then

386
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,090
also attack was committed through asking

387
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,149
or requesting a person to send in

388
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:35,370
information information in terms of the

389
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:38,639
actual account so that was our

390
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:41,489
hypothesis so we went out that validated

391
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:44,219
what did we do well we just went out to

392
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,780
ask people whether they were facing that

393
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,820
problem whether

394
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:52,460
in formation officers were being

395
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,770
attacked through their users and they

396
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,780
said yes we are receiving these targeted

397
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,490
attacks we also wanted to find out

398
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,580
whether they were interested in solving

399
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:03,440
that problem but as I went wanted to do

400
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,510
something about that or they just wanted

401
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,390
to find some magical solution through

402
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,879
technology to prevent users from falling

403
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,330
into those traps so we find a bit of

404
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,250
everything

405
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,220
those want to choose of problems with

406
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:19,040
technology others without technology

407
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,980
another said well perhaps it is a good

408
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,740
idea to make an investment and to raise

409
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:28,760
awareness so that was our hypothesis

410
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,860
that and it's validation and we took it

411
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,390
from there I have restarted to develop a

412
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:39,290
product the products in the beginning

413
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:41,480
didn't hold because well we wanted to

414
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:44,180
prove and to show that the product was

415
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,300
user friendly and that it could

416
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:50,570
eventually resolve the problem so as I

417
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:57,980
said we were that time we hit a very

418
00:23:50,570 --> 00:24:01,399
hard wall so the methodology a start-up

419
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:04,880
is aimed at learning and then we asked

420
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,520
many people and all of them said we

421
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,860
heard problem and our solution was the

422
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,080
best solution for the problem they

423
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:16,699
seemed wonderful we developed a platform

424
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,129
and in the beginning well we just tried

425
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,550
to sell it but again we found the same

426
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:24,500
problem we offered them a solution they

427
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,659
believed that it worked we offered that

428
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:30,080
solution to them and they didn't buy it

429
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:33,110
so that was very hard because the

430
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:38,659
municipal authority is aimed at learning

431
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:41,780
but not at selling so we started to have

432
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:46,880
a hard time because we were losing or

433
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:50,580
having less and less money so as I said

434
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:57,029
we were had our money was going down

435
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:58,230
down and that's where the key question

436
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:03,110
came into play

437
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:03,110
that is to say our team our partners

438
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:13,149
so we just pull through the difficult

439
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:15,340
times together but what happens then

440
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,170
there was a second group of people that

441
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:26,080
when we showed the platform to them

442
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:28,240
didn't show so much excitement and as I

443
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,220
said this second group of people were

444
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,780
more skeptical in the beginning when we

445
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,540
presented them with a tool with a

446
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,649
platform and in the end they bought it

447
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,980
from us

448
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:42,730
so Nina citavi helps you learn validated

449
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:45,040
products and to check that that the

450
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,910
product actually solve the problem and

451
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:50,980
that was a very very important learning

452
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:53,410
if you listen to the audio books you

453
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:59,200
will also hear that these methodologies

454
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:02,980
aimed at learning not at selling and now

455
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:08,320
we'll have a platform which is works

456
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:10,870
very well all throughout and thanks to

457
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,159
these early adopters that is to say

458
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:18,010
those clients that actually believe that

459
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,900
through our platform solves problem

460
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,340
perhaps they are not the best clients

461
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,090
perhaps they are not the best players

462
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:29,830
but were the early adopters so therefore

463
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:32,020
they that's where the value lies and now

464
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:36,929
I move on to the last part of my

465
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:39,930
presentation which is about MQ SP

466
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,930
methodology

467
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:48,450
to be successful and very proud of it

468
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:52,380
because I invented it myself and then

469
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:55,170
well being successful this relative

470
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,140
thing is not either being fully

471
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:02,880
successful or fully and successful and

472
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:09,020
what I'm going to tell you well just

473
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,020
keep whatever is of interest to you okay

474
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:23,140
so we won the business acceleration

475
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:26,709
program of incident so we were not aware

476
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:31,330
of what it actually meant have we known

477
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:34,870
that we traveled all the way to from

478
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:38,740
Argentina to here Harvey none death we

479
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:41,979
would not have came all the way to here

480
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,470
and when I first saw it I said well this

481
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,410
is precisely what we need well in

482
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:50,410
Argentina we were already selling we

483
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:54,190
have sold our product to three or four

484
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:57,820
clients and then we found this business

485
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:59,830
acceleration program and one of the

486
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:03,040
first challenges was about sand

487
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:05,860
awareness-raising platform so we were

488
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,889
very much in debt at that time we had no

489
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:14,979
money but we knew that we had to go for

490
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:17,110
it we started or joined a program or we

491
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,700
filled out all the forms and they said

492
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:23,169
well if you don't like it we can always

493
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:25,780
go back before we came to Spain we knew

494
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:28,510
that we had to set up a company in his

495
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:31,899
pain we were in Argentina we only had

496
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:34,330
three of her clients margin Gina we had

497
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:38,970
to set up a company to take part in the

498
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:42,550
program company here in Spain and I

499
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:44,940
convinced everyone around me but no one

500
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:48,490
knew that I was not hundred percent

501
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:52,390
convinced when everyone agreed was into

502
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:55,350
it I told them I confess that I was not

503
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,350
fully convinced

504
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:04,430
and we had to buy a plane ticket and

505
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:09,899
everything else that we needed and then

506
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:15,350
Savior clients came in and then he gave

507
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:21,240
us he gave us a three-year project so

508
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:23,909
clients with 3,500 users and he who

509
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,340
entered into a three-year project so

510
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:30,410
that meant all the money that we needed

511
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,409
to come all the way to Spain

512
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:42,350
this program

513
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:45,350
well when I came here I thought that I

514
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,360
was here to learn but I didn't know that

515
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,990
it was a competition a really hard

516
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:54,409
competition lasting for five months it

517
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:57,530
was very difficult in many aspects that

518
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:00,320
I will not refer to here but at the same

519
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:05,480
time that gave me the opportunity to see

520
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:08,720
snow for the first time and I was having

521
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:12,380
a very good time and I just to send out

522
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:19,550
these photographs to my friends and also

523
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:21,050
to relatives underwear well they found

524
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,730
it interesting because they say when you

525
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,590
are working really hard for years or

526
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:28,700
having a really good time and I say yes

527
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:32,899
and why not but not having the best of

528
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:36,620
both so with this I mean that being an

529
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,730
entrepreneur to sometimes be taken not

530
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,780
that seriously

531
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:46,190
so all from this time I set up five

532
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:48,740
companies so we now we are at this point

533
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,750
in time looking for investors and big

534
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:54,440
things have happened to us we will

535
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:57,140
continue to go through big things but we

536
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:03,200
should not be pessimistic you should not

537
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:06,320
be negative so we also had a hard time

538
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,130
but because we were naive enough without

539
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:14,780
this this is what made us move forward

540
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:18,080
and imagine but here we have two

541
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:21,410
profiles we have a skeptical person and

542
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,770
the second person staff person who turns

543
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:27,080
it down right away who said no right

544
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,990
away the first profile

545
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,689
sceptical person but look at you and

546
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:35,490
what somehow will not believe anything

547
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:37,900
where you will tell him

548
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:40,690
and sometimes you also have to

549
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:42,820
understand that the skeptical people are

550
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:45,670
not being as skeptical because they have

551
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:49,750
something against you but perhaps they

552
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:53,080
because they are just not encouraged to

553
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:55,540
go for your projects so we shouldn't

554
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,480
take that as something fully negative

555
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:01,560
but it is just that many people do not

556
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,560
want to be entrepreneurs

557
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:25,169
and also I recommend you to ignore well

558
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:30,060
when someone tells me no to me that

559
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:35,480
fills me that actually tells me that yes

560
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:39,780
I can do it I find motivation to do it

561
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:42,630
and now the circles pointer where betas

562
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:45,379
be where we are so there are three

563
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:49,290
circles I made this one hundred percent

564
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:50,100
okay what are we good at I was the blue

565
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:56,250
circle

566
00:32:50,100 --> 00:33:00,090
what are we good as then why I was

567
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:07,380
fascinated about and then what was far

568
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:11,840
away so at university I found something

569
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:16,650
that I feel passionate for that was

570
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:19,409
open-source software because I was

571
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:22,770
passionate about these I devoted time

572
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:28,140
Tweel effort to it there was no money

573
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:31,800
involved open-source software then

574
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:35,460
became a time that I decided well to try

575
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:40,520
it out how life is when you have some

576
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,520
money I bought a car

577
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:49,990
say here that I did not pay for my car

578
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:52,389
my father bought it for me and as I say

579
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:54,789
I was just doing whatever it was

580
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:58,840
suitable to me but I was not doing what

581
00:33:54,789 --> 00:34:01,690
I was passionate about and I was not

582
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,259
doing what I was good at so these

583
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:09,310
circles continue to change the size and

584
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:13,659
now the circle of what I was good at was

585
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:15,759
growing and growing and then what was

586
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:21,730
convenient to me and then what I was

587
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:23,619
passionate about so the more you know

588
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:30,569
yourself the more you know what you are

589
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:30,569
good at then I went back to that point

590
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:39,509
and then threes three different aspects

591
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:41,250
of myself we're getting closer and

592
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:44,309
closer to each other there came a point

593
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:53,969
where I was doing what I was good at

594
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:56,669
I was also passionate about it well the

595
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,379
beginning when you set up a company the

596
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:01,348
other people in a company earned more

597
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,309
money than yourself but as I said I was

598
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:08,029
working well most passionate about

599
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:08,029
liners etc

600
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:28,230
and there was a good mix there as I

601
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:32,240
moved on in entrepreneurship to really

602
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,240
want to find these full convergence

603
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:39,810
well sometimes I'm more into one of the

604
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:44,089
circles sometimes I move out of the

605
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,089
circle then I come back he needs

606
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:54,879
well I told you that in the beginning we

607
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:59,530
had no money then accountant went well

608
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:06,380
then as I say we came over here to Spain

609
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:08,900
company had to pay for those expenses so

610
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,870
we spent three five months here in Spain

611
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:14,270
we had to pay for those expenses so you

612
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:17,720
may be a good point in your life but

613
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:21,110
then out of a sudden you may something

614
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:24,080
may happen and that make you going down

615
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:26,630
so my personal recommendation try to be

616
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,180
aware of what you are good as also finds

617
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:32,480
out what you are passionate about but

618
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:35,029
never overlook what is convenient to you

619
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,370
what is suitable to you and then the

620
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:41,540
good thing is like having the mix of

621
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:44,000
them three well someone tells me that I

622
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:48,130
come from the future and I'm here to

623
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,130
tell you what will happen in the future

624
00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:03,609
actually this is about the way I am

625
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:09,880
planning my future

626
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:13,029
so I do projection enzyme often five

627
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,799
years and well to ascertain that certain

628
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,339
that where I'm having lots of trouble

629
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:21,130
when you have lots of travel present

630
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:24,670
time to kind of really project in the

631
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:28,180
long term so therefore my projection

632
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:30,819
doesn't go further than five years or

633
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:34,899
sometimes as I say my projections are

634
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:38,349
shorter in some time - so we have time

635
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:44,230
projection and have myself and then

636
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:47,410
these skills to be developed and

637
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:49,930
implemented I am here and this is what I

638
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:56,589
want together I'm halfway through with

639
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:58,288
my last companies for each of companies

640
00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:00,549
that I created I set out myself

641
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:03,279
different objectives in the beginning I

642
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:06,579
just wanted it to work then I just

643
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:13,299
wanted to learn then I wanted to become

644
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:14,600
the best in my town small town by the

645
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:24,290
way

646
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:28,000
then my objective was at achieving while

647
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:31,250
achieving a specific goal and then also

648
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,340
getting to know something that could be

649
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:37,430
a country for instance then creating

650
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,840
something well when you create a company

651
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,460
you are always creating something the

652
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,100
actual company the previous companies

653
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,380
that I created were service companies

654
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:49,130
but in the last case in the last

655
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:55,400
instance I create product company so

656
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:59,530
that was a difficult change and then the

657
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:03,440
other objective was to create contacts

658
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:06,200
and my last objective is just to create

659
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,860
a company that will allow me not to work

660
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,859
anymore

661
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:19,219
so my objective is my Desolator

662
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,219
subjective is happen

663
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:27,480
so higher up we'll have the actions and

664
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,050
skills that you need and you crossed our

665
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:34,050
outs with real life to start freely

666
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,520
strong and then you may have I don't

667
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,829
know you may be disappointed or

668
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,710
something may go wrong with your family

669
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:44,040
with your partner's so but it's actually

670
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:49,589
important is to keep growing to keep

671
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:53,640
walking to your objective so I have two

672
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:56,640
different ways to face any type of well

673
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,759
things going wrong shall I say it as a

674
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,440
failure and see it as a success what

675
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,720
this is relative I wanted to achieve

676
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:10,079
something and I didn't get a hundred

677
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:12,319
percent well sometimes you can really

678
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,000
tell that you have not achieved your

679
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:18,089
goal by a hundred percent but it is not

680
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,400
the case in companies even you fail well

681
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:21,810
you could read it as well I haven't

682
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,109
achieved it by a hundred percent but I

683
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:27,109
have achieved something so these are my

684
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:31,950
five companies these are my five

685
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:35,130
cybersecurity undertakings and notice

686
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:41,250
when you take a look at that we see the

687
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:44,760
goals here strategy execution and I'm

688
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:49,609
always below that I'm always below these

689
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:55,099
strategy articles but

690
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:58,788
I learn little by little and I get

691
00:40:55,099 --> 00:41:03,410
closer and closer to my understanding of

692
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:08,799
success or to what success means to me

693
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:08,799
and now my specific piece of advice

694
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:16,578
while we are talking about its course

695
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:19,519
here we are talking about minor

696
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:21,859
differences this is like f1 phrase or

697
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,988
like horse racing's the difference

698
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:28,788
between the first and the second and the

699
00:41:23,989 --> 00:41:36,230
third are just minimum so out of 5

700
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:39,409
we called 387 the second one was 385

701
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,409
[Music]

702
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:49,779
so we have made a huge effort and we

703
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:51,879
became second we finished second well we

704
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,280
came over here we thought that we were

705
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,770
here just to learn but then we entered

706
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,620
into the competition we worked really

707
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:02,440
really hard and our platform is and

708
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:06,040
awareness-raising platform it is not

709
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,080
fully doesn't offer full innovation such

710
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:12,279
as big but what actually helped us to

711
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,380
become second well our hard work I

712
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,320
develop a whole type of things and

713
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,720
energy everything I'm not going to tell

714
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:24,730
you everything that happened to me in

715
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:28,629
that wood that hard work that we did we

716
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:32,350
worked we gave it all second flexibility

717
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:34,750
and adapting well I come from Latin

718
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:38,860
America where everything is very casual

719
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:43,090
very informal and now I came to Spain

720
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:46,470
and I said no you are not past well well

721
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:50,830
we have Spain Italy Greece Portugal

722
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:54,160
Argentina it was different from what

723
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:56,950
happens here in Europe so I had to adapt

724
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,879
to some things here things that were not

725
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,879
respecting

726
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:13,118
as I said wealth could see that things

727
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:17,140
were not as suspected or as perfect as I

728
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,420
expected but the fact that I was not in

729
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,368
Finland that I was seeing his pain that

730
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,130
was not a huge problem because I had a

731
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:26,829
capacity to adapt because we come from

732
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:31,719
Argentina and then patience and

733
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:36,400
perseverance I am a quite an anxious

734
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:39,849
person I always feel that things will

735
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,249
happen they give him time points and

736
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:45,700
then they did not happen they did not

737
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:47,649
happen and then well if I'm surrounded

738
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,218
by anxious people there comes a time

739
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:54,309
that we all lose our patience we all go

740
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:57,420
mad when I want the competition for

741
00:43:54,309 --> 00:44:02,910
businesses on duration I got my so

742
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:08,140
excited that I burst into crying I

743
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:11,019
couldn't hold my excitement holding it

744
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:14,650
and waiting for things to happen they

745
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:21,180
may happen later than you expect them to

746
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:23,890
happen and then delaying that instant

747
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,649
rewarding that will need

748
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:29,529
so perhaps big things will happen by

749
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:32,400
December we'll stop to look for instant

750
00:44:29,529 --> 00:44:32,400
reward

751
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:38,170
so sometimes achieving a short-term

752
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:44,140
objective in the middle objective cost

753
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:47,109
against achieving long-term objective so

754
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:51,490
it is like if you same as a child you

755
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:54,069
are given what you can offer two things

756
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:56,589
to a child to say well either you get

757
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:59,200
this marshmallow now or you wait for

758
00:44:56,589 --> 00:45:00,690
some time and you will get two

759
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,779
marshmallows

760
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:09,430
so there are research studies courage

761
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:13,390
about that okay so it is good to learn

762
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:16,990
how to wait and now these emotional

763
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:19,140
rollercoaster so we all have ups and

764
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,140
downs

765
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:26,029
so it's very good to work in the team so

766
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:29,089
that you kind of compensate each other

767
00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:31,450
when someone is up someone else may be

768
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:31,450
down

769
00:45:32,069 --> 00:45:39,009
some of my definition of successes this

770
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:43,269
is a mix of hard work and of dreaming

771
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:45,599
big so but do not stick to one of the

772
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:51,359
two questions only

773
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,359
so working hard positive attitude

774
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:01,170
so this is also hard work always hard

775
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,170
work

776
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:05,869
does that mean success no not really

777
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,288
well health does not equal success

778
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:08,289
always

779
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:18,499
and then sometimes entrepreneurs are

780
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:21,849
afraid and think about things that would

781
00:46:18,499 --> 00:46:27,788
never be translated into reality

782
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:27,789
so therefore we have to dream big so

783
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:38,359
these exits or this success is the

784
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:43,579
effect of the consequence of an action

785
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:46,009
or of an undertaking so this is what

786
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:50,079
well actually we need us to make it the

787
00:46:46,009 --> 00:46:54,019
right decisions and of being successful

788
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:56,479
so because I come from a small town what

789
00:46:54,019 --> 00:47:01,729
I would like to recommend you to

790
00:46:56,479 --> 00:47:04,270
recommend local elements local problems

791
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:06,819
small things first

792
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:11,650
[Music]

793
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:14,288
do not hesitate to do that everything

794
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:18,699
that you will and everything as much as

795
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:22,449
we will do will help you to be big in

796
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:25,719
the long term do not self limit yourself

797
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:28,929
to not be limited to the worlds of fully

798
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:31,689
to the world of technology today so now

799
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:34,469
focus which is great challenge for

800
00:47:31,689 --> 00:47:34,469
Millennials

801
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,650
I was about to be late to this

802
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,530
presentation because entertain myself

803
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:49,690
playing arcade so the thing is that we

804
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:55,840
have very many distractions around - so

805
00:47:49,690 --> 00:48:00,550
even in entrepreneurship here we have

806
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:02,830
here full image have our coding when we

807
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:05,920
don't want to face reality what do we do

808
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:08,770
we just hide ourselves behind a computer

809
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,670
and we just don't want to interact with

810
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:14,890
anyone sometimes when you lose focus you

811
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:18,130
end up distracting yourself and not

812
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:21,279
focusing on what you have to do well if

813
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:23,470
your company requires you to go there

814
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,620
and sell your products even if you don't

815
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:29,680
like it you should do it that's my

816
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:32,069
advice that's my piece of advice focus

817
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:37,000
to not get too serious and not go crazy

818
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:41,970
but just be in the well somewhere in

819
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,970
between ok middle way

820
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:53,339
often success is associated to two

821
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,960
things isolated person or something

822
00:48:53,339 --> 00:49:01,440
isolated the person is either successful

823
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:03,450
or not know sometimes is yes and no well

824
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,670
you may think that because I'm here

825
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:08,848
giving this presentation I am successful

826
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:12,390
I'm not successful but I'm not a failure

827
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:14,849
either well and that's the reason why I

828
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:16,500
gave well the title duties presentation

829
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:18,210
because I just want you to come over

830
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,490
here I said that I'm a failure you will

831
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:23,839
not come up quick here but we should try

832
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:26,790
to break down with that stereotype

833
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:30,270
sometimes we have we shouldn't think

834
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:33,029
that the actual sex belongs to only one

835
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:35,220
person the person who appears as the

836
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,450
leader of the team but surely this

837
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,799
person has been helped out and

838
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:44,720
surrounded by very many other people

839
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,720
that his own part of the success

840
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:56,299
so some people become successful but the

841
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,020
way they harm very many people that

842
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,020
shouldn't be like that

843
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:10,640
what not aiming as achieving an

844
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:15,050
objective without been detrimental to

845
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:18,220
others or humming orders and this is

846
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:22,450
what I learned from my incent ancestors

847
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:30,500
when my grandfather died I could see

848
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:34,910
that many people went to his peril and

849
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:39,200
then I wondered how did he manage to be

850
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:41,930
so much loved he was a carpenter he

851
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,379
having a very good people all his life

852
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:48,560
when she left this world many people

853
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:50,780
went to his burial and then I learned

854
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,770
from that and I say well I want to

855
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,220
become like him

856
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:59,540
and this is the objective I'm aiming at

857
00:50:55,220 --> 00:51:02,959
this is my goal and I'm taking these

858
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:06,319
from these two celebrities Arnold

859
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:12,560
Schwarzenegger I recommend you listen to

860
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:15,770
some of his inspirational jokes and also

861
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:18,980
follow or listen to what Jim Carrey said

862
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:21,500
but the most important value that you

863
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:29,200
may have is the impact that you may have

864
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:32,390
in other people so what happens even

865
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:35,450
well I can also help other people to

866
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:38,000
make enough money just to stop working

867
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:40,910
which is my objective and what happens

868
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,400
if I not only improve my life around

869
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:49,040
I also improve the life of people I work

870
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:51,560
with my clients my vendors why not doing

871
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,500
all that I'm not doing good to myself

872
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,779
and also to the others so it's about

873
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,490
achieving and being successful and also

874
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:02,060
helping out the others

875
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:05,859
so this methodology comes from an old

876
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:10,580
expression that we use in Argentina

877
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:13,400
so these means like go for it go for it

878
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:19,220
do it do it

879
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:21,140
there to do it do not hesitate so what I

880
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:24,080
like the most from the acceleration

881
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:27,049
program and what we learn from mentors

882
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,000
and others were just having the

883
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:31,640
opportunity to meet other entrepreneurs

884
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,850
because other entrepreneurs told me

885
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:37,670
don't you hesitate to produce a product

886
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:39,860
even if it is not fully perfect they

887
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:42,890
gave us recommendations as to how to

888
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:46,390
deal with investors how to interact with

889
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:46,390
clients cover it

890
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:58,299
so make the best of time you rain take

891
00:52:52,599 --> 00:53:00,880
fast action and go for the next security
