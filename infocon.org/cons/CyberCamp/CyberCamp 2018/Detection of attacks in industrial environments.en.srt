00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,300
Cadell we wonder the administer the

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,460
quarter yield amok

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,270
good morning everyone welcome to our

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:25,080
fourth and last day for cyber camp 2018

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:30,590
we're starting the day today with the

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:33,960
winner of the Spanish seminar on

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:38,489
cybersecurity research they were the

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,579
winners of the last edition and exhibit

10
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:45,589
organizes that seminar with them because

11
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:51,810
in C Bay very much believes in the need

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:55,980
to do R&D and I and mikela Dube is here

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:58,860
to tell us about how to detect security

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,480
attacks in industrial networks and why

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:06,240
that environment is different from

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,240
others he is a lecturer at the

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,070
University of Montreal a warm round of

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,520
applause for Mika thank you so much

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,039
huggable

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,670
welcome thank you very much for coming

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,210
to my workshop and hackable

22
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:32,340
has very kindly introduced me and told

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:34,949
you that I'll be addressing how to

24
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,060
address security attacks in industrial

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:42,930
environments from my own viewpoint in my

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,690
own experience because in my research

27
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,930
I've been trying to compare how we've

28
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:51,408
been learning about security from

29
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,530
different points of view in different

30
00:01:51,409 --> 00:02:02,130
environments and I've been looking into

31
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:04,140
all of us for my PhD dissertation I will

32
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,158
start my presentation tell you a little

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,430
bit about our research group I will tell

34
00:02:08,158 --> 00:02:14,420
you why industrial environments are

35
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,420
different from

36
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:30,000
IT environments I will also tell you

37
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:33,750
about different contributions made over

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,900
time about industrial environments and

39
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:42,569
cyberattacks we heard about Stuxnet and

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:46,590
things have changed very very much since

41
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:49,890
then and I will finish my presentation

42
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:55,040
with some resources and guidelines there

43
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:58,379
for those who want to start research

44
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,660
about cybersecurity in industrial

45
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,500
environments we're very fortunate now

46
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,739
because compared to what was available

47
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,160
five six years ago we now have what a

48
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:15,230
lot of tools and resources so if you are

49
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:18,870
keen on this particular topic I will be

50
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:23,638
pointing out where you can look into it

51
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:25,919
I hope I hope we have time for a Q&A

52
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,500
session at the end of my presentations

53
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:33,090
but please I encourage you to stop me

54
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,340
and ask any doubts I want this to be

55
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,150
interactive I would like to hear your

56
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:43,040
feedback during my presentation where

57
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,989
needed as well so let's get started

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:52,108
as you know my name is Nicola Torben I

59
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:54,299
am a lecturer and researcher at the data

60
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:56,389
analysis and cybersecurity research

61
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,930
group at Mondragon

62
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:06,200
University so that's what we do we

63
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:09,810
analyze and try to secure data in

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:14,388
industrial environments trying to solve

65
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:18,870
issues connected with manufacturing

66
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:25,350
problems modelling apart

67
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:27,930
we're how to use less power in

68
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:32,010
manufacturing detecting attacks and

69
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:35,280
intruders consultancy for best practices

70
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,310
about how to better secure industrial

71
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,429
networks and so on

72
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:45,090
apart from that I'm also a member of the

73
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:48,120
euskal hack Association which is the

74
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:53,880
Association we have in the Basque region

75
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:56,669
on IT security and we also organize our

76
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:04,370
own conference at the end of June every

77
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:10,880
year so what is it that I do

78
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:13,500
specifically I did my PhD on industrial

79
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,180
intrusion detection and I was very lucky

80
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:23,820
because I was given the first award the

81
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:29,250
first prize at the J and IC seminar this

82
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:32,010
year I work with cyber security as you

83
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:38,280
know in industrial environments part in

84
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:40,530
fact in our group we always try to be

85
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,039
very very close to companies whether

86
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,619
it's industrial firms or cyber security

87
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:53,520
companies and here we can see up on the

88
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:56,550
list on the screen a list of recently I

89
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,639
also work with data analysis in

90
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:05,670
industrial firms although that takes up

91
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:08,610
less of my time preparing this workshop

92
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:12,570
I thought we should first cover the

93
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:15,750
brief overview of some of the industrial

94
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:19,130
attack detection approaches from an

95
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:24,110
industrial point of view as I say said

96
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:27,810
when I started my PhD things were pretty

97
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,110
different it's an area that's much more

98
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:35,190
mature that has matured very fast in the

99
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:38,610
last few years so before we get into the

100
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:41,820
nitty-gritty of this topic what is it

101
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,960
that I mean when I talk about industrial

102
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,849
environments are you familiar with this

103
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:52,260
or not very much so what is an

104
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:55,050
industrial control system well I'm

105
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:59,360
talking about systems that automate

106
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:08,340
control and administer or manage

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:11,190
physical equipment so in a manufacturing

108
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,219
plant for instance there is an

109
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:17,610
industrial control control systems so

110
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:21,030
we're talking about PLC's what we'll see

111
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:24,810
about that later on so when we talk

112
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:29,309
about critical infrastructures well

113
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:33,890
those are the ones we need for our daily

114
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:38,750
use of power and transport a critical

115
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:43,919
manufacturing and so on a lot of us is

116
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:46,170
automated processes connected with power

117
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,050
generation for instance that's all

118
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:52,620
automated so they've course these

119
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,770
industrial control systems that's very

120
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,600
much under control

121
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:01,919
automated controls and why is that

122
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,380
special or different because the main

123
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:09,620
objective of control systems is not

124
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:14,340
keeping something very confidential so

125
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:17,140
their main core objective is for the

126
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:21,419
process to continue to work

127
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:24,909
for instance in a thermal power station

128
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,190
what the main point for those systems is

129
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:30,450
for the power station to continue to

130
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,850
produce energy no matter what happens

131
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:36,520
their second objective has to do with

132
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:41,220
the real interaction these systems have

133
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:47,350
with the physical world so any problem

134
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:51,040
that may arise whether it's voluntary or

135
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:54,910
involuntary there are consequences in

136
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,150
the physical world whether it is

137
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,790
intentional or not there are

138
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:04,360
consequences like people being left

139
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:08,760
without power at home for however long

140
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:15,190
or a manufacturing plant not producing

141
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:17,890
their goods and maybe machinery being

142
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:20,380
ruined because of that so we have to be

143
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:24,819
particularly careful in industrial

144
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:27,580
environments problems don't just have

145
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,430
cyber consequences shall we say they

146
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,160
have real physical world consequences

147
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:36,400
and that's why security is even more

148
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:41,170
important so in industrial control

149
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:44,740
systems and we talked about PCs these

150
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,430
years SCADA systems there are different

151
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,550
systems

152
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:52,620
drue but they're all fairly similar so

153
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:56,800
when we secure these systems

154
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:59,590
brands and names of systems doesn't

155
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,770
matter that much so I will be talking

156
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:07,210
about industrial systems as if it was

157
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:11,530
all the same thing a distributed control

158
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:13,390
system in a TCS is different from a pcs

159
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,150
or from a SCARA

160
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:20,770
but I'll be referring to them as if it

161
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:23,290
was just one homogenous single group so

162
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:27,100
what does an industrial network look

163
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:31,059
like well it's very very much a vertical

164
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:34,239
structure divided into very well-defined

165
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:38,259
layers at the bottom we would have the

166
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:41,319
process that needs to be controlled that

167
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:46,149
is hardware and physical environment and

168
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:49,089
motor with sensors and whatever all

169
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:56,739
those pieces of equipment and devices

170
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:59,289
and physical systems and hardware so

171
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:02,289
that would be the foundations at the

172
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:06,299
bottom of that stack then we would have

173
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:10,869
controllers getting information from

174
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:14,669
there the layer before so that they can

175
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:18,719
then ask and make machines do whatever

176
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:25,978
for instance imagine we have in a

177
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:29,669
catering firm a large pressure cooker

178
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:29,669
making soup

179
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:39,290
so in that boiler pressure cooker or

180
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,989
whatever it is if the temperature rises

181
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,689
over and above a particular threshold

182
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,490
then the heat it would have to come down

183
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,990
and that's what the controller is

184
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:54,139
checking for it to work we will see that

185
00:11:50,990 --> 00:12:01,339
the main control system in industrial

186
00:11:54,139 --> 00:12:04,730
environments our PLC's what our other

187
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:07,129
control systems would we have there over

188
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:11,149
and above that in the same layer and we

189
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:13,819
would have the SCADA controllers is like

190
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:19,430
the supervising layer because we have

191
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:21,769
controllers down below in charge of less

192
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:25,779
important tasks and then the higher

193
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:31,149
layer in charge of them more advanced

194
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:34,399
controls then we have data historians

195
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:37,160
gathering and recording all that

196
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,589
information so that it's available for

197
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,740
whoever needs it whether it is to keep

198
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:45,560
an inventory or what or or whatever and

199
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,850
then we would have the human machine

200
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:55,209
interface HMI checking that the process

201
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:58,430
is working in a high on a higher layer

202
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:00,800
so we're talking about rather complex

203
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,380
systems mostly in critical

204
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,279
infrastructures and facilities which

205
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:10,689
means that operators have to be

206
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:10,689
supervising everything works correctly

207
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:23,569
24/7 non-stop operators people who check

208
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:27,110
if the PRC's for instance I can't

209
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:31,300
respond well to a particular threat well

210
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:34,930
then operators would take charge and

211
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:37,790
have control of the system of the

212
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:42,459
otherwise automated system

213
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:47,770
this is a PLC which is the core of

214
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:53,060
industrial networks is the heart and so

215
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:57,970
they're in charge of first scale control

216
00:13:53,060 --> 00:14:01,239
this is not a new modern PLC it says

217
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:05,240
been working for a number of years and

218
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:12,730
look at all the inputs and outputs on

219
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:16,930
that b LC well they gather information

220
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:20,750
from the field then they're in charge of

221
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:26,469
distributing information to the field as

222
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:33,130
well or for instance to open or close

223
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:33,130
flows all those actions would be done

224
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,090
they would have

225
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,010
Ethernet connectivity more and more

226
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:48,150
these days so that they can then

227
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:54,350
communicate with the layers up above but

228
00:14:48,150 --> 00:15:00,630
anyhow PLC's are the main leading

229
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:05,640
character as it were in this story for

230
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:08,570
those of you who are used to this type

231
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:13,310
of hardware well we're talking about

232
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:17,390
remember is not Giga size but mega size

233
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:24,000
with very limited processing power and

234
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:27,480
very very expensive believe me why

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,310
because they have to work in very harsh

236
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:35,550
environments surrounded by dust by very

237
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:41,520
harsh industrial environments and

238
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:44,400
logically we want to have them last at

239
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,040
least as long as the production line is

240
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,610
going to be operating so I'm talking

241
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:57,510
about lasting maybe a life of 10 15 20

242
00:15:50,610 --> 00:16:00,810
years then the HM eyes human-machine

243
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:04,680
interfaces they're supervising up above

244
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:07,079
that everything is working correctly so

245
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:11,819
that's a brief over line of how

246
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:16,740
industrial networks work so what happens

247
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:18,540
if something goes wrong and I'm not

248
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,780
talking about science fiction I'm

249
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,959
talking about when things have gone

250
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:28,290
wrong what happens then the first

251
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:31,140
instance in that we know about about an

252
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,500
attack to an industrial network in fact

253
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,470
it's a little bit fuzzy it was back in

254
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:41,610
1982 we're not even sure if it actually

255
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:45,750
happened it was an oil pipe in what was

256
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:48,300
the Soviet Union still at the time there

257
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,330
was an explosion and one of the

258
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,640
hypothesis was that the software that

259
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:58,790
controlled the pie

260
00:16:52,640 --> 00:17:02,470
join the oil pipe was a hacked version

261
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:09,109
an illegal version of the original

262
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:17,480
Canadian software the American Secret

263
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:21,699
Service's said there the CIA said a

264
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:25,579
Trojan had goes into that hacked version

265
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:28,730
and that's what caused the explosion

266
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:33,530
although the second hypothesis was that

267
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:36,380
it was human error due to an operator

268
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,960
and in fact is quite peculiar because we

269
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,740
don't even have confirmation is the

270
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,430
explosion

271
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:46,100
finally and actually took place at all

272
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:50,270
anyway that's the first possible

273
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:54,949
instance now the second one to 2004 in

274
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:59,320
2004 this one did happen a company that

275
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:07,630
was in charge of wastewater treatment in

276
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:11,240
Marucci Marusya water breach an employee

277
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:14,900
stole some radio communication equipment

278
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,150
and in his vehicle he went to the

279
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,050
different pumping stations and as a

280
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:24,170
result of that there was a spill of

281
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:30,680
thousands of litres of wastewater into a

282
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:35,330
nature parks and with no control or that

283
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:37,880
sewage at that time people everybody

284
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:41,240
thought that radio equipment was ever so

285
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,850
expensive so nobody would be able to do

286
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,630
anything like this because of user

287
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:51,469
writing authentication security but it

288
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:56,950
did happen he actually went round and

289
00:18:51,470 --> 00:19:00,350
opened the taps the flood gates

290
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,240
he was course and the case went to court

291
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:04,750
and

292
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:09,370
he ended up in prison so and the third

293
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:12,610
instance is the most popular example

294
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:17,049
that everybody knows about is Stuxnet

295
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:19,500
the Stuxnet incident apologies if I'm

296
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:22,649
going to bore you telling you about this

297
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:31,620
apparently is the most sophisticated

298
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:35,320
malware ever written for zero day

299
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,668
vulnerability affecting two power

300
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,668
stations in run

301
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,280
problem here is that the spinners the

302
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:59,210
centrist centrifuge machines were the

303
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,700
uranium centrifuges were working faster

304
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,620
than they should have been but operators

305
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:07,190
didn't know about it as far as they

306
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:10,429
could tell the centrifuge system was

307
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:14,000
working fine until one day they just

308
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:17,930
stopped working they're very expensive

309
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,440
pieces of equipment and as a result of

310
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:26,350
this there was a big this was a big

311
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:31,790
problem for the Iranian nuclear power

312
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:36,909
plant and system then the following

313
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:45,560
attack that was confirmed after Stuxnet

314
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:49,430
was in 2004 it was at a steel iron and

315
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:52,990
steel mill works in Germany we don't

316
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:56,390
know where exactly or which one and in

317
00:20:52,990 --> 00:21:03,050
2004 and there was a spear phishing

318
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:05,720
attack an executive from the company

319
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:11,870
received that email and as a result of

320
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:15,020
that they got into the system accessed

321
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:20,090
the information system and and they had

322
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:23,629
access to the furnaces there was a fire

323
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:27,889
in one of the blast furnaces as a result

324
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:31,390
of that and that caused massive losses

325
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:35,030
the fire took a long time to be

326
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:37,430
controlled we don't know if malware was

327
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:41,090
used we don't know if that was their

328
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:45,770
actual proper target we don't have that

329
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:48,350
information we then move on to 2015 and

330
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:50,240
this was the large the first large-scale

331
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:57,350
attack

332
00:21:50,240 --> 00:22:02,650
to an electricity transmission lines as

333
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:06,649
a result of that some 230,000 people in

334
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:09,080
Ukrainian suffer the blockhouse for a

335
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,410
number of hours with 30 substations

336
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:16,070
switched off similar start as far as we

337
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:19,960
know spearfishing on the IT Network and

338
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:22,370
then that's how they accessed the OT

339
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,710
network well this is the first lesson we

340
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,159
need to learn we need to really clearly

341
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:32,780
segment and separate the IT Network and

342
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:36,429
the LT network in a company so how can

343
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:41,899
we protect industrial networks

344
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:44,929
what should the procedure be because

345
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:52,760
most of us in this field of security are

346
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:55,910
IT experts so our idea is that we have

347
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,120
to divide the network into different

348
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:02,090
layers we know that we think as IT

349
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,629
experts that the main points there is

350
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,490
our data confidential data that's why

351
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,220
they should be at the core of their

352
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,550
protection then the following layer to

353
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:17,000
be protected most protected would be the

354
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:19,580
application then the host or hosts and

355
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,590
then last but not least the network

356
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:28,909
person for us the core our focus what is

357
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:30,740
it is data and data confidentiality if

358
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,840
you go to a company to an industrial

359
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,030
company and you ask them hey what would

360
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,330
you rather not have access to your data

361
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:41,360
for a whole day or for the big wide

362
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,399
world to know about all your data for

363
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,320
your competitors to know and so on well

364
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,679
I can tell you that rather not have

365
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,220
access to their data for just one day in

366
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:53,480
Surrey

367
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:56,330
non industrial networks or company non

368
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,700
industrial companies whereas if it's an

369
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,850
industrial environment it's the process

370
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,070
that's important what would be at the

371
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,500
core it would be

372
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,658
the process is different from what we

373
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,769
think as IT experts they want to

374
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:15,789
continue to produce their parts not some

375
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:19,179
boats whatever it is and traffic data

376
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:21,730
hose network is very much secondary for

377
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:24,009
them why because it's the process that

378
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:27,190
has added value for them because

379
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:36,509
Industrial cybersecurity as opposed to

380
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:40,000
IT cybersecurity the cost of a

381
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:42,070
cyberattack is very very easily

382
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,860
calculated they tell you straight away

383
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:49,178
who if it was one week it would cost us

384
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:51,340
this much whereas if it was an attack

385
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:53,320
from an IT point of view not an

386
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,389
industrial point of view it's much

387
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,490
harder to calculate that how much does

388
00:24:55,389 --> 00:25:03,039
it cost if a company if the web line for

389
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:06,850
a company crashes for a week well if

390
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:09,070
it's an online shop it's hard to

391
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:11,379
calculate but in an industrial

392
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:13,178
environment well it just cost a counter

393
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:16,959
the nuts and bolts they won't be selling

394
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:20,259
that's the calculation so again it's a

395
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:24,039
process availability that matters most

396
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:27,809
the process must keep going and working

397
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:31,600
no matter what so when we prepare

398
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:34,330
security measures you have to we have to

399
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,340
be ever so careful and respectful not to

400
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:40,240
compromise the process first and

401
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:43,500
foremost so again what is the main

402
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:47,379
difference between the industrial

403
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:49,750
Network and an IT Network what a number

404
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:53,799
of differences but first and foremost

405
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:56,289
the in IT networks we mostly care about

406
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:59,259
communication and data processing

407
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:02,820
whereas in an industrial network is the

408
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:08,049
process that matters manufacturing

409
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:12,470
process because let's not forget that

410
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:16,158
security for a manufacturing point very

411
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:19,190
often means safety safety of operators

412
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:23,840
or of people around them can you imagine

413
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:26,419
how nice it was in the Ukraine when

414
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,889
people had this blackout thousands and

415
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:31,250
thousands of people in the middle of

416
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:34,039
winter particularly depending what

417
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,669
boilers and heating systems they have it

418
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:40,789
can't be nice right another important

419
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:44,539
feature in an industrial network is that

420
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:47,929
timing is always shorter mostly if we're

421
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:52,158
talking about the automotive industry or

422
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:55,880
where PLC's are very much present we're

423
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:59,450
talking about 200 microseconds that's

424
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,899
timing for them whereas if we're talking

425
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:07,070
about a wastewater treatment or sewage

426
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:11,479
treatment for instance POW time is

427
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:15,850
important as well a little bit less but

428
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:19,250
still very important so when we deploy a

429
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:23,269
new security system we need to take that

430
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:26,360
into account we can't go and do sniffing

431
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:31,070
with a man-in-the-middle and then that's

432
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:34,729
going to cause some latency that would

433
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:38,269
add a few more microseconds in latency

434
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:40,940
and that would have a big impact for

435
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:45,590
them in the manufacturing process

436
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:50,139
the timing industrial networks also have

437
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:54,649
other differences and peculiar peculiar

438
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:58,760
elements there we don't have users that

439
00:27:54,649 --> 00:28:01,459
go to see the newspaper morning early in

440
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,100
the morning all that traffic comes from

441
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,019
PLC is the one saying to the control

442
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,168
server this is the temperature this is

443
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:11,139
so every half second every second I

444
00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:13,909
don't care a little state like that and

445
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:15,740
every now and then the operator will do

446
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:18,200
something but industrial networks are

447
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,560
much more aesthetics and deterministic

448
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,990
then the IT Network topology does never

449
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:29,379
change country to a Wi-Fi network where

450
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:29,380
users lock arm and add at all times

451
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:36,800
it doesn't change almost ever oh that's

452
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,930
good cuz if we see something changing it

453
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:42,320
means that there's something there that

454
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:44,540
is not attitude and that's what I'm

455
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,980
indicating here and then what I said

456
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:54,970
before PLC's and the nodes as well so

457
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:58,840
computing power is minimum and then we

458
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:02,410
are using equipment that is way all the

459
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:05,090
the ones we're used to so what can we do

460
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:07,130
let's try and use these features that

461
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,990
industrial networks have trying to

462
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,540
detect attacks if they are so

463
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:16,340
deterministic and the static let's dive

464
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:23,240
into that and explore it and this is the

465
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:25,370
state of the art for attack detections

466
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,550
and let's see this from a personal point

467
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:32,060
of view before stack next which seems to

468
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:34,850
be the pleistocene well things were

469
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:37,129
being done and have been done this was a

470
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:44,000
field of research that was quite limited

471
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:47,470
contrary to what we have now but things

472
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,740
were done and we are talking here about

473
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:54,770
solutions that were already existing

474
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:57,230
such as ideas based on signature already

475
00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:01,370
on i.t that were translated into the

476
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:03,920
industrial world but mainly these were

477
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:08,149
proof-of-concept proofs of concept and

478
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,650
part of the standards and the good

479
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:11,890
practices we have for industrial

480
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:14,930
networks were non-existent back then

481
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:20,510
what least whitelist and as we call it

482
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:23,720
now very much recommended but was not

483
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:28,129
that advanced there were new industrial

484
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,870
fibers by wall sorry we didn't have the

485
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,850
network isolated from the item and it

486
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:40,340
kind of a privat concept part without a

487
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:40,340
dream need a real neat by the industry

488
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:49,860
through ancestry deed in indeed conduct

489
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:54,720
a survey of the existing papers that was

490
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:57,419
2010 and it summarizes all that had been

491
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,180
done before stud snacks and they

492
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,710
discussed some terms that will later on

493
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:07,080
become more important

494
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:09,870
and there is model-based detection which

495
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,850
basically we built a model of what the

496
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,620
network or should be or the pressure

497
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,730
should be in order to detect things that

498
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:21,110
are out of the pattern out of the model

499
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:25,320
and then specification based detection

500
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:27,090
where we create some manual standards or

501
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:32,100
rules stating that there are some things

502
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:34,169
should not be as they are which is a bit

503
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:39,209
more simple than the model based

504
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:41,780
detection this is before 2010 there are

505
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,700
already some papers a discussing it

506
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:48,000
there is a start in research field

507
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,000
there's a few workshops on the topic but

508
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,880
it is a still a bit far from where we

509
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,150
are headed then we have stacked necked

510
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,100
everything is on the media people get

511
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,780
scared and it becomes a feel of research

512
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,980
that is a bit more fashionable than it

513
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,040
was in the past

514
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,080
there's more on the topic more workshops

515
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,690
and everything having to do with

516
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:13,800
industrial cybersecurity we don't think

517
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:16,110
about some 10 years ago and so people

518
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,870
start working on their seriously but

519
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:22,649
mainly to fails with our network

520
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:27,540
detection attack detection so I see how

521
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:29,790
the network behaves see if there are any

522
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:34,379
packets that do not comply with those

523
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:36,600
rules but then field detection so I

524
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,890
don't check the network I don't care

525
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,560
about the package or the

526
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:43,470
flows or the services what I'm

527
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:46,169
interested in is knowing what's going on

528
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,320
with the process and if the process is

529
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:53,670
not working as it should

530
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:58,620
that's what I care about and so that's

531
00:32:53,670 --> 00:33:01,230
where with the stacks neck I'm beyond

532
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:07,709
sore setting that's when I start my PhD

533
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:10,740
dissertation first of all with my

534
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:14,370
dissertation I came to realize there

535
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:18,540
weren't security visualization tools for

536
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:22,550
industrial networks so what we did was

537
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:26,428
built one using strain diagrams

538
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:29,909
that's circle which indicates that there

539
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:33,740
are several industrial hosts and they

540
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:37,470
are all arranged there we have PLC's

541
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:40,320
that's blue then edge aim eyes that's

542
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:42,880
purple and then control servers that's

543
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,310
orange

544
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,860
I said before that industrial letters

545
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,330
are very deterministic if a host is all

546
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:55,840
the same communicating with another one

547
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:58,060
this will not change if PLC has one or

548
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,550
two controlled service associated would

549
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:04,030
only send send information there doesn't

550
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:07,270
need to send information elsewhere the

551
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:09,850
PLC is just an automated process that it

552
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:11,949
is producing the traffic it will not go

553
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:14,980
on the journal or the newspaper to see

554
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:17,949
how the soccer team's done that traffic

555
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,770
will always be static so and we said if

556
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:23,230
it's static let's go and see what about

557
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:27,340
the network flows which should be static

558
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:29,590
as well and that's what we need those

559
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:37,649
lines connect in different parts of the

560
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:43,570
circle our net worth was the Whizzer of

561
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:45,668
those strings show the number of packets

562
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:50,770
per flows or the wider the flow the more

563
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:55,299
active the traffic and the narrower the

564
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:58,840
flow these narrower the string so what

565
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:01,510
we did was decide to build f1 list who

566
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,520
is encountered with whom and whoever

567
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:07,270
does not meet the parameters we will

568
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:11,380
label them wrapped and that's what we

569
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:13,270
did see the flow between H M I and PLC

570
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:22,200
where we should not have any traffic and

571
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:22,200
we see it is blue this was done with a

572
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,970
car paint in blind

573
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,340
it is a real example and then as the

574
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:36,879
reference you will see some other use

575
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:39,490
cases where we detect EO as and it is

576
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,150
not just the existence of abnormal flows

577
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:46,450
or the non-existence of a network flow

578
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:48,520
if a PLC is offline we need to know why

579
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:50,200
because that's also important we don't

580
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:54,380
know what's going on with the process so

581
00:35:50,200 --> 00:36:00,868
that's it and then

582
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:03,839
after having done this therefore the

583
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:07,859
life crisis as it usually happens with

584
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:11,670
the PhD dissertations and there we

585
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:14,960
change our focus not just at the network

586
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:19,170
but also that what about the fields just

587
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,339
the network well for IT people this is a

588
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,770
bit more intuitive

589
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:24,569
these are flows and packets and these

590
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:27,420
are things we're more comfortable with

591
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:29,250
when we go to the field we are talking

592
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,450
about temperate temperatures vibrations

593
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,480
pressure so these are physical

594
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:38,730
magnitudes the ones that we are

595
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:42,079
monitoring these are a bit more

596
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:44,490
complicated for IT for industrial

597
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,930
backgrounds but that's easier for

598
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:54,058
control I mean in the field that's a

599
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:55,980
truck floor but for the net where

600
00:36:54,059 --> 00:37:04,309
sometimes the existent equipment weren't

601
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:08,299
allowed to have many things for example

602
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:12,000
Network flows for those we had a

603
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:15,559
mirroring of a switch and that was

604
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,990
doable because it was good enough but

605
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:21,100
most of the industrial switches back

606
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:25,359
there

607
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:28,560
it's still operational now but cannot

608
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:31,750
you cannot be used with mirroring so

609
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,420
what about flows such as as flow or net

610
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:38,710
flow these are top range actually so

611
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:41,620
when we talk about industrial equipment

612
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,630
which is expensive by the way it becomes

613
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:47,950
even more expensive so sometimes that

614
00:37:43,630 --> 00:38:01,510
Edward electronics existing it's a bit

615
00:37:47,950 --> 00:38:03,850
more basic so in the field we know the

616
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:09,090
data are there and and we do monitor

617
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:11,560
them the operator monitors everything

618
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:14,410
temperatures and everything so there's

619
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,779
something going out that should not so

620
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:20,890
you don't need to buy expensive switches

621
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:25,480
you do have the information out there we

622
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:30,850
saw there were several papers based

623
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:34,120
mainly on physical models I have a

624
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:37,240
process and I'll describe it using code

625
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:43,920
I need to scrap everything the process

626
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:46,810
does this is um amazingly complicated

627
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,480
collecting all the information from the

628
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,100
physical world into code it is actually

629
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,480
it's a difficult we do the

630
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:59,170
interdependence says and it isn't simple

631
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,840
it takes lots of expertise and it's

632
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,440
costly and whenever the process changes

633
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:10,660
the model is useless

634
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:14,050
so we focused mainly on attack detection

635
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:16,690
which would be data guided we only get

636
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:20,800
data we do not build a physical

637
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:22,720
complicated process that will not well

638
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,580
that yes it would work but it would be

639
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,609
too complicated for what we want to do

640
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:29,480
as long as we can get that information

641
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,119
out of the data

642
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:36,079
so first we focus on attack diagnosis

643
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:37,369
and why is that there were already some

644
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,820
interesting proposals in attack

645
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:41,720
detection or anomaly detection so it

646
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,640
says hey but mmm

647
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,649
oftentimes we didn't know or operators

648
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,359
didn't know what was going on something

649
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:51,680
was wrong they knew but he didn't know

650
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:57,529
why so this is an example so figure this

651
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,450
is a pipe and there's a fluid inside and

652
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:03,740
there's a flow sensor on the left side

653
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:07,549
if the flow is flowing the sensor knows

654
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:10,240
the flow rate per oh I don't know

655
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:14,060
falling per hour or per minute whatever

656
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,609
right side and bottom side we see two

657
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,299
cases where there's Neal that's a flow

658
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:22,640
rate one because of the valve is closed

659
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,990
so it doesn't flow through and the other

660
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,670
one for whatever the reason there's a

661
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:31,629
problem and it doesn't reach its

662
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,630
destination so with those two variables

663
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,490
so there's a drop in the incoming flow

664
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:45,890
so we need to know why this is

665
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:50,630
interesting there's been an attack where

666
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:52,609
someone tried to close that valve or

667
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:55,069
maybe there is a problem with the

668
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:58,759
provider and we didn't get the raw

669
00:40:55,069 --> 00:41:05,270
material in by checking this graphs is

670
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:08,869
not doable all the details out there but

671
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:11,990
basically with a modern with main

672
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:14,690
component analysis and then also cut

673
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:18,950
production graphs well we saw that for

674
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:20,900
some conditions that was doable with

675
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,629
some drops well on the left side D is

676
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:26,750
seen and there is a negative bar which

677
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:30,770
is large one stating that the incoming

678
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:33,829
flow is lower than it should be and on

679
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:37,880
the right side what we see is that the

680
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:40,730
opening ratio for that valve is lower

681
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,210
way lower than what it should be so it

682
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,210
is closed

683
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,980
interesting isn't it we can see if

684
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:53,000
there's been a malicious attempt to

685
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:54,910
close the valve or maybe not what's

686
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,690
interesting is that doesn't need to be

687
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:59,779
network-level

688
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:02,510
it doesn't need to be an command is

689
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,120
maybe an operator who's tired gone to

690
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,310
the valve and manually closed it and if

691
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,529
we check the network level we would not

692
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,529
be able to detect it or diagnose it

693
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,750
either

694
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:17,810
so these went on and we had some other

695
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,120
Network parts integrated or embedded but

696
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:23,299
there is another more recent proposal

697
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:26,210
after my dissertation this was published

698
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:31,150
on CSS and this was a detection of more

699
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:31,150
advanced attacks in the field

700
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:40,570
this is Passat doesn't bazaar that's the

701
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,569
name again if you wanted details

702
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,520
you can go to the paper and we can get a

703
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,049
signal whatever that is a vibration

704
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,840
change in temperature change in pressure

705
00:42:53,050 --> 00:43:05,050
whatever and with the blue side you

706
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:10,750
learn and that like that you build a

707
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:14,490
cluster which is green and then once

708
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:17,620
we've learned we see how it's doing and

709
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:20,979
the black side the black part keeps

710
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:27,009
producing it's okay and the black part

711
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:29,830
of the dots are inside the cluster then

712
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:36,460
it's the blue part but as an attack is

713
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:39,910
don't the structure of the so-called

714
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:42,940
temporary temporary series is change and

715
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:45,220
the red spots are dot moved to the left

716
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:48,400
side of the cluster that information is

717
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:50,620
protected with just one variable which

718
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,740
is a detection variable the one that you

719
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:56,980
see on the bottom left side and if the

720
00:43:53,740 --> 00:44:01,479
attack starts and it all changes that

721
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:05,740
attack indicator is pipe spikes over a

722
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,900
threshold and we get a warning that is

723
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:13,029
something wrong

724
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:15,510
all right so we run several attacks a

725
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:19,750
chemical process that I'll explain later

726
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:22,810
also a gray water treatment plant and

727
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:27,450
then a water distribution plant on the

728
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:30,310
left side we see an evident attack

729
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:32,290
especially an operator that it's

730
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:34,930
checking the variable and can say well

731
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:38,740
there's something going on going on here

732
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:42,058
but it is detected so there is a spike

733
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:45,339
in the signal and an alarm would go off

734
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:49,740
what's interesting here is the one in

735
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:52,869
the center the middle case the red side

736
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:57,098
in the attack and it doesn't vary much

737
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:59,800
when compared to the other graph it's

738
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:03,819
such a subtle attack that it is masked

739
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:07,030
inside the signal noise and the bottom

740
00:45:03,819 --> 00:45:09,190
graph maybe you cannot see but with

741
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:11,890
comparative methods the black one which

742
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:14,670
is a previous one previous method and

743
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:18,970
then the blue one ours and we see that

744
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:24,430
the prior method cannot detect it but

745
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:27,160
ours can the reason is that many of the

746
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:31,450
proposals nowadays what they do used to

747
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:34,390
do was a no wind war the process of

748
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:39,430
status is now let's calculate or

749
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:42,640
estimate let's estimate the next reading

750
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:45,098
read so we kind of predict the future

751
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,420
and then if the prediction and the

752
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:51,339
reality look alike no problem there many

753
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,740
attacks that are so subtle that don't

754
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:58,240
change much we will not be able to

755
00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:00,399
detect like this and so what we do or

756
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,359
what we've done is try to see if there

757
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:08,710
is any structured breakup as part of the

758
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:12,549
temp structure so that we see that in

759
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:16,869
surgical detail then on the right side

760
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:19,960
we checked because these were attacks

761
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:21,700
that we performed on laughs environment

762
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:25,299
but we wanted to see whether they can be

763
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:28,058
translated into a real plant this was a

764
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:29,770
water distribution plant and yes we saw

765
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:31,299
that if there's something weird with the

766
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:32,470
processes in it to be in the sack

767
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:35,380
because we don't have any more

768
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:39,990
information on the spikes but still we

769
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:39,990
see that we do detect them

770
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:48,390
from before Stuxnet this film already

771
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:50,640
had some you know there were some

772
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:55,129
proposals mainly that were IT based to

773
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:58,890
detect attacks on industrial networks

774
00:46:55,130 --> 00:47:01,200
then they've used that specificity that

775
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:04,460
the term monistic nature of industrial

776
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:08,730
networks do detect those network attacks

777
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:11,040
and then lately the network intrusion

778
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:14,510
detection in the field that would be the

779
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:19,710
process level is quite quite active

780
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:24,660
where is this headed well I guess this

781
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:27,300
is my own forecast here we will come

782
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:31,259
closer and closer to machine learning

783
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:36,720
based solutions we will find more and

784
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:39,720
more proposals using that information

785
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:45,149
that we collect from the field for

786
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:48,209
intrusion detection and I feel they will

787
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:51,390
be integrated with the network proposal

788
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:53,820
so if we see something wrong in the

789
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:58,410
field or in the network these will be

790
00:47:53,820 --> 00:48:00,360
fed back and we will take actions on the

791
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:02,790
network and that's where I see the

792
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:05,520
greatest potential for software-defined

793
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:08,430
networks with a central controller

794
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:11,150
having all the network objects and there

795
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:18,049
it will face the attack in a dynamic way

796
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:22,620
but always always again always with that

797
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:24,720
touching or interfering with process

798
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,560
availability this would be otherwise

799
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,740
secondary what what matters here is

800
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,920
having process I'm available the team if

801
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:37,229
we can make sure that the process keeps

802
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:42,440
producing that's positive if it doesn't

803
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:42,440
help us with that it might not be useful

804
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,450
so if there's someone in the audience

805
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:55,800
who likes this topic and thinks okay

806
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:59,310
industrial security I like it so there I

807
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,990
would like team discuss some resources

808
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:03,900
that helped me back in the day now we

809
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:09,660
have many more but let me encourage you

810
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:12,750
to use them so you can learn especially

811
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:14,490
from the IT point of view we need to

812
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:17,400
change our mindset we need to play

813
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:19,379
around and learn and it takes effort so

814
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,360
read as many books as you can there's

815
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,030
two you've chosen there are a few more

816
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:29,010
but on the left side that's a classic

817
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:33,900
it's some years old and it helps with

818
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:35,760
research and also helped me learn water

819
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,510
an industrial network is how it behaves

820
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:42,900
etc right side you see something quite

821
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:46,410
similar these are not books that explain

822
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:49,320
where the field of research is now

823
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:51,049
that's not the goal but it helps us

824
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,730
understand what the problems of

825
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:56,580
industrial cybersecurity are why we

826
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:59,670
cannot use an anti-virus and I'm on a

827
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:01,799
PLC for example PLC does not have enough

828
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:04,800
computing power for that but if you

829
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,170
don't know you don't know these books

830
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,060
help

831
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:11,730
then for research and mainly academic

832
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,150
research I would recommend this other

833
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,200
book

834
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:18,620
which might not be so much focused on

835
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,240
cyber security industrial cyber security

836
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:25,529
but it helps us understand the language

837
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:27,600
that is used in academic journals and

838
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:33,610
false positives false negatives and all

839
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:36,130
of that I would really recommend it then

840
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:38,170
there is another but there are so many

841
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:43,930
repositories on github I will mention

842
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:46,600
that but first there's a list a resource

843
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:50,470
list to learn industrial cybersecurity

844
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:55,180
from the behavior of PLC's to peak hubs

845
00:50:50,470 --> 00:51:00,339
with Network captures it is good to have

846
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:05,529
a look at it it might help you find

847
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:09,460
tools for industrial cybersecurity some

848
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:14,820
as grass Marlene I don't know if that

849
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:17,410
rings a bell but sometimes for service

850
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:21,160
recognition or NetWare recognition

851
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:23,950
errors recognition it is not advisable

852
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:26,379
to use nmap contrary to IP networks

853
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:28,810
knowing that there is something similar

854
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:31,660
not that intrusive which is more passive

855
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:33,730
that's grass modeling and other hundred

856
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:38,710
tools there and then there's a couple of

857
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:42,970
industrial processes first one is the

858
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:44,830
bottle bottling plant virtual plant

859
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:48,399
that's the name we have the process on

860
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:51,160
the one side that's the top-left side

861
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,830
there is a tap fill in a series of

862
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:56,379
buttons all the way up to a level on the

863
00:51:53,830 --> 00:52:01,360
right side you see h mi where it's a

864
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:05,110
separator how they're doing and both

865
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:08,320
communicate through a industrial

866
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:13,000
protocol and then there are some preset

867
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,780
attacks that you can have with your own

868
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
money

869
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,070
buzz attacks and where you see that the

870
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,340
bottling plant does not work in is not

871
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:25,780
filling up the bottles otherwise if the

872
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:30,750
plant would be flooded and it's easy to

873
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:34,240
see it's Python so easily understood and

874
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:35,920
as a first step it's okay and then there

875
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,819
is a process which is a bit more

876
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:42,850
complicated but I really like it

877
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:48,160
the chemical process I said before it is

878
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:51,600
a real chemical process this one it is a

879
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:55,890
plant that produces some chemical

880
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:58,810
chemicals and here we can have these

881
00:52:55,890 --> 00:53:03,609
surgically accurate attack see the

882
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:06,610
process into dependencies and actually

883
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:11,590
it's complicated because it takes some

884
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:13,660
learning about control theory and it

885
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:17,710
takes some chemical engineering as well

886
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:22,089
but it is such a powerful tool you know

887
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:26,710
that she drive attacks and also fail

888
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:31,090
detection there's a framework where you

889
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:35,620
can close valves spoof enough sensor

890
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:39,750
signals very good but complicated though

891
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:39,750
and as such it takes time all right

892
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:48,100
and just to finish here so that you get

893
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:50,980
a general idea and Sharon - Annette was

894
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:53,950
a strategic it is important because of

895
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:57,640
the risk it entails and because of the

896
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:59,710
cyber security features involved but

897
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:04,950
there are some specificities we need to

898
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:07,450
consider some play in the favour of the

899
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:10,660
cyber security researcher and some

900
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:13,000
others against us solutions that are

901
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:15,040
based on machine learning or artificial

902
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,980
intelligence or whatever is very active

903
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,610
research field for the field and for the

904
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:22,980
network both

905
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:26,370
I'd like to encourage you if you want to

906
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:28,470
learn it isn't impossible yes the

907
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:31,230
mindset has to be changed and many

908
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:33,240
things need to be learned on maybe we IT

909
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:39,360
technicians were not so used to it

910
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:42,229
but it is doable I managed it and so

911
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:44,880
that means that I guess any of you cared

912
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:49,010
that's been all if there are questions

913
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,010
I'll be happy to take them

914
00:54:56,789 --> 00:55:02,759
sure microphone please

915
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:21,640
my answer would be it depends the top

916
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:23,890
range companies already have wireless

917
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:27,190
sensors and that kind of thing that is a

918
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:29,379
reality reaching up to you those

919
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:32,410
companies with more resources but even

920
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:34,930
smaller more traditional companies where

921
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:39,460
lines are not changed that often there

922
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:42,069
may be it remains to be seen when and if

923
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:44,950
it is a very conservative sector it's

924
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:50,020
true and the mindset would be if it if

925
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:52,480
it ain't broken don't fix it so for the

926
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:54,880
oven got companies I think there is a

927
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,420
change but for other companies it might

928
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:05,190
take longer but yes it's the reality is

929
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:08,030
not sci-fi okay

930
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,030
oh there's one

931
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,200
[Music]

932
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:21,670
what about security controls that should

933
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:29,799
be implemented the basic ones that is to

934
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:34,510
safeguard information assets I would say

935
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:35,890
to monitoring network because if we

936
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:38,020
wouldn't know what's going on we think

937
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:40,480
we know what's going on but oftentimes

938
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:43,810
it is not the case we need to see what's

939
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:48,900
going on first and second segment in

940
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:51,580
segment in and segment in almost total

941
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,400
segmentation between the control network

942
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:57,430
and the IT Network and the operating

943
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,200
Network so all accesses are well

944
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:02,080
controlled because they will always be

945
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,490
some access chain because any remote

946
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,230
maintenance and everything has to happen

947
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:07,990
but it has to be tightly control and

948
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:10,300
then as a class segment it inside the

949
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:13,990
industrial network for different lines

950
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:17,440
for example production lines or also

951
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:20,529
business divisions that all has to be

952
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:24,339
very nicely segmented this year I find

953
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:26,140
our basic and then some as usual

954
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:28,779
it's not just technical it its

955
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:31,598
cross-sectional awareness raising and

956
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:35,109
training of the people the employee is

957
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:38,320
involved and then monitoring maybe

958
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:41,160
you've had an experience by using some

959
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:45,849
kind of a tool you mean off the shelf

960
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:51,848
what open sores are I personally haven't

961
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:55,420
had some people in my group yes but I

962
00:57:51,849 --> 00:58:01,140
haven't so I'd rather not say much

963
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:01,140
because probably I would mess it up

964
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:13,930
all right thank you very much them for

965
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,930
your attendance I hope you enjoyed it

966
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:25,659
you

967
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:25,659
