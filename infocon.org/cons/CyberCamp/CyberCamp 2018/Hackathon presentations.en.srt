2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:21,329
well we'll let you know how long you

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,150
have left for every presentations five

4
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:27,899
minutes after you start it will let you

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,270
know and will also let you know five

6
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,910
minutes and then one minutes before the

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:39,149
end so please be respectful with the

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:42,718
time you've been given right then we're

9
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:45,570
ready to start we're going to let you

10
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,450
know about how far you we've gone we've

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,810
almost completed our objective which was

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,690
capturing the whole spectrum the range

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,090
of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth although we had a

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,149
little bit of trouble with the Bluetooth

15
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,899
of them at the last minute you'll see

16
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,619
how so we're just going to do the demo

17
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,570
on Wi-Fi because of the Bluetooth

18
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:12,509
problem we had when we finish at the

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:16,649
Bluetooth code we will upload it to the

20
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:24,950
repository later today here we see the

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:28,710
diagram you see we have four ESP devices

22
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:32,400
sniffing or the Wi-Fi traffic they can

23
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,729
find and collecting it the contents will

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,700
then be sent to the reception probe and

25
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,908
from there to the server where the web

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,570
interface and the database is why

27
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:48,890
because we want to find any malicious

28
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:52,919
agent anywhere we don't want to generate

29
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:57,920
intelligence or correlate data once the

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:01,470
objective has been identified that's it

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,650
now I'm going to connect onto the

32
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:08,310
application panel because in the room we

33
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:11,459
have now four devices distributed here

34
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,760
in the room they should be collecting

35
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,680
information this is the type of device

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,940
we can see it up on the screen they're

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,430
connected through batteries

38
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,780
the application has this panel for

39
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:36,100
access is so safe with logging and as

40
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:39,970
HTTP with a signature as we said at the

41
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:45,430
beginning we are using Django admin

42
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:51,340
power for data management editing and so

43
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:54,730
on basically well you can see like this

44
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,730
better up on the screen this is the

45
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,920
basic jungle interface which is very

46
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:06,190
simple to install we use the token from

47
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,799
the API to ascend the information with

48
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,460
the devices then the application has

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,000
these four areas one is bot list where

50
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:20,550
max that we detect as malicious will go

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,350
then the device's collect the ESP s

52
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:29,230
nodes would be the ESP s with the

53
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:32,519
firmware images and then the managers

54
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:36,250
would be getting well we've used

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:39,100
telegram we wanted to use SMS s but the

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,550
API was not coping with it very much

57
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:47,560
it was taking too long users with this

58
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:51,459
application then you see this is the

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,550
type of information that it collects we

60
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:57,850
have identified the nodes with a name

61
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,989
sending the marks then detecting what

62
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:06,609
they are they are as I think if there

63
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:09,310
are there's a authentication network

64
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:12,220
authentication if there was not no

65
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,419
control as to when devices can connect

66
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,370
to send the data there could be the

67
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,470
authentication and the information would

68
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,940
not be transferred so that's another

69
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,940
value that's important to detect

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,770
I'm now going to show you a real-time

71
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,840
detection how it works here we see the

72
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,789
working devices except for the Bluetooth

73
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:41,359
one because we didn't have time to

74
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:47,930
finish it now receivers there's a Jorge

75
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:53,270
and myself a we used the telegram board

76
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:58,760
for our IDs to get the alert my device

77
00:04:53,270 --> 00:05:02,539
would be getting those right now

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,300
the blacklist is 0-2 let's get one of

79
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:12,680
the max that we have detected this one

80
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:18,230
for instance we're going to edit so we

81
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:22,690
can get the alert right it's on the list

82
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:26,200
now once packets get to the devices

83
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:29,000
those who have not been processed though

84
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,120
those will be the last one to come and

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,630
then I should get the alert here on my

86
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,630
telegram

87
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:23,409
right one minute has elapsed and the

88
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:27,200
devices should be detecting it now right

89
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:29,000
the notification then notifications show

90
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,520
it so I'm going to leave this open for

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you to see the next alert this is the

92
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,520
type of message you get presence

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,440
detected for the device and then the

94
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:50,180
probe that detected it numbers three two

95
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:54,340
and one so that's a short time detection

96
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:57,110
you see is coming again on number four

97
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:01,070
the idea is that we would be using now

98
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:05,480
the errors RSSI for the devices knowing

99
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:08,090
the range the distance on the time with

100
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,090
an algorithm we could then geo locate

101
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,280
that particular device although we have

102
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,460
to take into account the rebound effects

103
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:22,099
and other values that would be a

104
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:25,010
detection of a blacklist device the

105
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:28,160
alerts will work whenever there is an

106
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:32,030
detection because I often think that

107
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,390
when you have a light warning you about

108
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:38,419
something in your car and you ignore it

109
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:41,870
then something will go badly wrong so

110
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:47,990
it's best not to deactivate alerts after

111
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:52,310
a certain time a module will be designed

112
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:54,650
later so that it's not too invasive so

113
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,380
that if there are 15 different alerts

114
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,960
you don't get 15 messages you would get

115
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:03,850
it all together as one so that would be

116
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,599
Mac detection what about the

117
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:13,969
authentication

118
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:18,378
alert I don't know if you can see this

119
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:21,770
up on the screen because of the letter

120
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:22,909
type and size we have launched our

121
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,448
packets

122
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:25,449
packets

123
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,190
you didn't detect it this time

124
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:52,520
on this side that bar

125
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:56,719
thanks to jungle filters we can detect

126
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:59,670
for every Mac checking for the

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:05,910
authentication you see here it detected

128
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:12,120
it oh I know why it didn't work I forgot

129
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:15,689
a ap needs to be set as the objective

130
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:23,670
the target otherwise the alert will

131
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:27,180
never come up this time it should work

132
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:31,740
for the neck next the authentication

133
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:38,279
there you have it you see ap has been

134
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:41,640
detected good so that would be the

135
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:47,490
system Jorge has been working more to

136
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:52,370
integrate Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and he can

137
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,370
probably tell you better how that went

138
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:02,130
the Bluetooth chip was almost ready for

139
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:06,839
our USS eyes and so on I must confess

140
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:11,130
that I'm not very good with 32 SP with

141
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:16,850
that a particular multi-functionality

142
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:19,980
for multitasking I had a problem for

143
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,690
tasks not to overlap and that was the

144
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,110
main problem why we couldn't finally

145
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:29,570
implement Bluetooth we could see 8 max

146
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,570
if that's as far as I could go really

147
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:36,930
unfortunately you can't see how it would

148
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:40,939
work it would work exactly the same as

149
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,939
for Wi-Fi but for Bluetooth

150
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:48,250
also because of the different issues

151
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:51,130
that have come up from other teams well

152
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,490
first thing we checked when we started

153
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:59,980
with the project is for it to support

154
00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:03,839
MFP we checked the chips mostly for the

155
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,399
the authentication side of things

156
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,959
sometimes we don't know whether the

157
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,790
support is working because of the chip

158
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:15,518
but we open the ticket through

159
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:18,610
expressive so hopefully with a 5

160
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,490
gigahertz and that will be improved in

161
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,139
the future so that's all from us thank

162
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:27,720
you very much for inviting us to be here

163
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:27,720
and for letting us take part

164
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,509
okay

165
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:51,590
hola nosotros good afternoon

166
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:55,520
here are our names al Jose Ignacio but

167
00:12:51,590 --> 00:13:00,850
the four of us and here we have the anti

168
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:04,910
shoulder surfing attack platform what is

169
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:07,730
our target for this - warning a user

170
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,370
that somebody else is there trying to

171
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:13,160
see what they're doing with their device

172
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:16,180
why is this - any different because we

173
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:21,230
want to defend the end-user which is the

174
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:24,229
weakest link on the chain we have three

175
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:27,350
main objectives one is for the

176
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,960
application in the long term the second

177
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,890
one we want to do well with a hackathon

178
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,860
and then you will see what we have

179
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:40,250
managed so we want to develop a

180
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:44,450
multi-platform application that can work

181
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:46,940
on Windows Linux or Mac so that when

182
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,060
there is an attack and it's detected and

183
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:53,530
it can then use different models of

184
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,969
machine learning both online and offline

185
00:13:53,530 --> 00:14:00,740
because we are taking part in the

186
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:03,910
hackathon we wanted to design an MVP a

187
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:08,840
simpler way to work with the application

188
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:12,550
so that you can use then later to also

189
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,230
make the application grow the hackathon

190
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:19,810
asked us to use different models of

191
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:23,660
machine learning so we wanted to compare

192
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:27,530
online and offline possibilities with

193
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,600
pros and cons we also want to find a sub

194
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:33,650
set of actions so they can be

195
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:37,460
implemented on MVP how far did we go

196
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:40,370
did we guess well facial detection is

197
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,050
working and for that we have used

198
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,410
machine learn

199
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:48,589
models that have been trained over a day

200
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,660
why because of lack of time during the

201
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:54,079
hackathon and also because we can't

202
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:57,529
access those models very easily we've

203
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,488
also done the mud multi platform MVP we

204
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:03,739
have compared online and offline

205
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:07,519
possibilities with pros and cons and we

206
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:10,850
have selected two offline modes models

207
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,089
for the application with configurable

208
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,920
actions that can be persistent that is

209
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:19,009
even if the application is switched off

210
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,410
there is still selected we also want the

211
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:24,079
screen to be blocked when the attack is

212
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,709
detected and also for brightness to

213
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,479
change and notifications to be sent

214
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:33,939
let's compare the models for the cloud

215
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:37,579
option we have checked iru as a

216
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:41,540
recognition by Amazon and then offline

217
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:44,209
to other models the latency obviously

218
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,189
it's a lot slower on the cloud you first

219
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:49,248
need to send your request to the cloud

220
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:52,248
and be told if there is a face detection

221
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:53,929
or not weather whereas a offline the

222
00:15:52,249 --> 00:15:58,879
machine does it all and it is much

223
00:15:53,929 --> 00:16:01,249
faster the cost well the cloud service

224
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,999
if you need to send your request and

225
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:07,759
Amazon's is quite expensive so who's

226
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:11,149
going to pay for that users well there's

227
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,959
no scalability there or we could offer

228
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:17,600
the Amazon service with that

229
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:21,349
infrastructure as a premium service for

230
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,660
the application but we're not convinced

231
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,619
by this either so we decided to use the

232
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:30,860
offline models which are free of charge

233
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:35,360
in the cloud mode you always need the

234
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:37,579
Internet Amazon Azur or Google whatever

235
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,550
whereas offline you don't need the

236
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:43,969
internet you just need your device

237
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:47,030
for training well the cloud model hasn't

238
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:50,270
no training needed whereas in the

239
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:52,250
offline mode you can either either use

240
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:57,620
pre trained models or you have to train

241
00:16:52,250 --> 00:17:01,430
them yourself about an accuracy the

242
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:05,119
cloud model allows not just face

243
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:07,459
detection but also knowing if two faces

244
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,069
are the same or not and you only need

245
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:15,380
two pictures for us with very high

246
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:18,050
probability about prediction accuracy

247
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:22,190
well offline it very much depends on

248
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:25,849
which system you select about a user

249
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:30,470
knowledge the user needs to configure a

250
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:33,469
configure the Amazon account whereas

251
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:35,480
with the offline mode is all transparent

252
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,690
and the user don't need to know what's

253
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:42,470
going on what are the drawbacks well

254
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:45,440
firstly there are very few libraries for

255
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:50,530
phase recognition with machine learning

256
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:54,080
which are non je s because most

257
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:59,240
applications are Python or reiatives we

258
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:03,490
used phase a P dot J S which is a very

259
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:06,110
new library in on beta with a very few

260
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:09,560
documentation and that was a limitation

261
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:13,610
because it doesn't allow for models to

262
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,540
be offline you need to first load a on

263
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,280
the Internet

264
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,389
so first time you run the application

265
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:22,730
you should always use the internet mode

266
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:27,110
when developing the tool we also found a

267
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:30,950
security issue on Windows when you run

268
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:34,010
your application it doesn't ask for

269
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,390
authorization for the camera to work it

270
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,300
just starts recording

271
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:42,050
whereas on Mac it does ask first time

272
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:44,090
you use it for your authorization what

273
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:48,409
are good ideas for the future for this

274
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:50,830
well identifying the user we didn't have

275
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,020
time to include that unfortunately

276
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,559
because the eyes I

277
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:59,080
so is more complex than face recognition

278
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:03,490
the second idea would be using different

279
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:05,669
cameras for depth and angle change or to

280
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:10,059
know if there's a camera behind

281
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:12,820
recording we also wanted to check when

282
00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:16,899
you move away from the computer for it

283
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,580
to detect it and block it also plugins

284
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,260
or whitelist

285
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:25,840
for apps so if you're using sublime it

286
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,629
would know that that's the API and that

287
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,090
device wouldn't work and also shortcuts

288
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:35,110
maybe in the future for the brightness

289
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:38,379
to change just with a couple of clicks

290
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:46,030
and now my colleague is going to show

291
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:48,340
you the demo we've got the github video

292
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,379
of this demo if you want to watch it

293
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,470
online but we're going to play it live

294
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:58,350
here let me just wait for the

295
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,350
application to start first there it is

296
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:07,050
have a look at that top right hand

297
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:10,000
corner that's the application window and

298
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:13,480
we wanted to have that design without

299
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,270
edges so to make it visually more

300
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,000
attractive we decided the window should

301
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:23,080
be small so that is not cumbersome it

302
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,990
doesn't take up screen too much and you

303
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,169
can move it just in case where it is by

304
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:33,010
default imagine it's blocking something

305
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,330
important let me just check get a little

306
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:37,360
bit closer to the camera

307
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:40,689
well it's recognizing my face that's the

308
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:44,820
blue framework and down below there is

309
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:49,870
the confidence a percentage that a

310
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:52,870
about my face so there's phase detection

311
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:56,020
first and here is the menu on the top

312
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,668
bar is again not cumbersome so that it

313
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,918
doesn't stop us from seeing what the

314
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:03,220
camera is recording then we have the

315
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:07,179
recording control you see i press the

316
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:10,539
button and the recording stops and my

317
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,700
laptop says the LED says that it stopped

318
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:15,220
recording and then you have this other

319
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,909
button here for play and start recording

320
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:24,480
again then on the right we have the

321
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:27,070
settings so that we can change the

322
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,799
machine learning model we're using

323
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,799
because developing the application we

324
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:35,350
have checked different models some have

325
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,830
worked better than others and the one

326
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:41,230
we're using now is part of the

327
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:44,620
repository and it's loading now for face

328
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,720
recognition why is this nice because in

329
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,239
future if we have a better model than

330
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,659
this all you would have to do is include

331
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:56,500
the that models URL here and our

332
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:58,929
application would load that model here

333
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,260
we have the different actions for our

334
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:04,530
application for instance sending

335
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:07,780
notifications if somebody is coming

336
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:11,408
approaching from the back lowering the

337
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,970
brightness as well of the screen so that

338
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,909
people wouldn't be able to see it

339
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:18,150
properly or block the screen completely

340
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:25,480
my colleague is going to approach

341
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:29,250
approach me now stand next to me you

342
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,250
didn't detect your face very fast

343
00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:36,820
can you just die just a little bit

344
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,279
longer because sometimes the

345
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,399
notification takes that little bit

346
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:45,720
longer oh dear it doesn't seem to work

347
00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:54,489
sometimes it takes a little bit too long

348
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:59,710
let me go to the menu now let's check

349
00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:04,080
the brightness so that it detects a

350
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:07,659
different face a different from mine

351
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,519
then the brightness will be lower I

352
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:13,659
don't know if you can see that the

353
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:18,190
brightness is much lower now there is a

354
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:20,429
keyboard command that we have included

355
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:24,070
so that you can go back to the initial

356
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:27,340
config a brightness one brightness in

357
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:30,340
this case and the rest of the methods as

358
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:34,990
well what about a scree scree blocking

359
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:38,590
roof is going to approach me again you

360
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:46,679
see the screen blocks automatically as

361
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:55,330
soon as it detects the other face so

362
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:58,269
that's about it logically the demo video

363
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:01,210
is available as I said for you on github

364
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:03,820
if you want to watch it again so if you

365
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,940
are happy with this project and you want

366
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:17,789
to contribute this is the repository on

367
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:17,789
github for you to do so on take next

368
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,800
okay preparado seven eight

369
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,490
por favor the next team CB nets can you

370
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,490
start getting ready

371
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,330
good afternoon everyone

372
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:44,900
the competition has been so exciting and

373
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:47,210
so tiring and everything else but here

374
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:51,560
we are all happy to tell you about our

375
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:54,500
work we've developed a tool that can be

376
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:57,230
used anywhere on the Internet

377
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:03,940
but because we had very little time here

378
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:03,940
we decided to just focus on some domains

379
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:18,830
round about 6,500 domains we've got a 2

380
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:22,190
now then with a back-end made up by the

381
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:26,810
core that connects up to the web sites

382
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:31,310
and collects data for further analysis

383
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:36,980
at the backend we also have the plugins

384
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:40,220
or structured in files and then we also

385
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:43,760
have a directory with configuration for

386
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:47,530
each or settings for each blogging and

387
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,260
then at the front end we have the GUI

388
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:54,560
for the user where you can include the

389
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:57,530
URL that you want to check and different

390
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:01,669
options to choose from then we have an

391
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:05,720
in-depth standalone area that we've code

392
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:08,540
ender render in charge of a report

393
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:12,320
writing in two different formats and

394
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:14,960
then we have a browser selenium that can

395
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,070
be automated which is what we use for

396
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,070
while browsing the web sites because

397
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:25,700
it's a local demo I've got it here on my

398
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:29,570
computer on my laptop but we want this

399
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:33,700
to be a tool that will be scaled up in

400
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:37,600
different modules so that we can have

401
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:42,430
in front ends sending requests launching

402
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:47,709
a - in cores each core within instances

403
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:52,230
of selenium so that the system capacity

404
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:56,430
could be greater we've used selenium

405
00:28:52,230 --> 00:29:00,370
connections as well so we don't have to

406
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:06,220
design too many of them and also its

407
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:09,550
cache and means that when two requests

408
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:12,720
are sent and you're not a sent every

409
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:16,960
apply then the last one will be valid

410
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:23,740
what's the idea for plugins well the

411
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:26,290
input is an object in cascade it just in

412
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:30,790
case information it has to be shared

413
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:34,210
then the output for this would be its

414
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:36,970
name at the output we would have their

415
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:40,150
name and the score as a percentage

416
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:44,440
seeing if that truly scores or not and

417
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:48,670
also if the plugins have to be stopped

418
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:51,610
and then an area for messages for human

419
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:54,880
interpretation what plugins have we

420
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:58,179
implemented a dummy which is a little

421
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,910
bit like a framework in case you want to

422
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:04,650
develop it further we have two automatic

423
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:08,920
plugins the SSL and the online

424
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:11,500
confidence one to check if the SSL is

425
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,350
present or not if it still valid or not

426
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,410
and also the confidence one if it's

427
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:20,980
present or not and nobody needs to

428
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:23,370
intervene what about the plugins for

429
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:27,300
cookies for those work

430
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:30,100
semi-automatically recovering the

431
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:33,850
cookies first and then there should be a

432
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:36,459
blacklist and a whitelist to know if

433
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:39,459
they're harmless or not is there some

434
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:42,580
infringement or not although that is a

435
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:46,550
manual process a process to feed all of

436
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:52,379
this we should also feed other plugins

437
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:56,129
that have definitions for legal laws and

438
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:59,370
regulations for the ssl one apart from

439
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:02,760
finding the URLs is all also going to be

440
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:06,510
checking for contents within each URL

441
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,120
and we call this blogging definitions

442
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:13,590
because it can't be automated and this

443
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:17,129
is a tool that has to be fed a little

444
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:19,080
bit like updating the database for

445
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:23,060
definitions in this case like very much

446
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:26,310
like an anti-virus would work or works

447
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:31,230
let's have a look at the interface for

448
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:34,950
the website we've prepared these

449
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:38,040
screenshots person we can actually

450
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:42,690
launch them later if there's time so

451
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:46,379
here the URL that domain we press scan

452
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:49,410
and this is the results this is zero

453
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,590
percent so that wouldn't score for the

454
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:55,230
total at the end then for other ones

455
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,449
we've got different percentages here it

456
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:03,030
tells us which cookies are allowed or

457
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:06,870
not with prorated percentages and a

458
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:10,790
final score if I press here on ODT or

459
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:14,810
PDF well the report would come up in

460
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:17,990
whatever format in a more visual manner

461
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:21,240
this website it doesn't have online

462
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:23,460
confidence the score is zero it doesn't

463
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,010
count so it's in orange in red or

464
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,220
whatever seems to be problematic in

465
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:34,350
green or whatever seems to be fine this

466
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:37,680
a scroll down menu and allows us to

467
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:42,510
choose which plugins we want to run in

468
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:47,040
this case we have not marked and as I

469
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:49,980
sell confidence for instance so that it

470
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,720
can skip whatever we don't need for the

471
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,940
reports

472
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,149
this is another example with a different

473
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:02,070
website and this is an example that we

474
00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:07,739
prepared specifically to make sure 100%

475
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:13,759
would be scored you see there it is what

476
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:17,309
about the back end well it allows for

477
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:20,009
statistics to be there statistics that

478
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:22,350
have been stored it looks a little bit

479
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:25,110
prettier life like this

480
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:28,529
here we have some examples that we've

481
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:34,668
prepared what can we do here we'll send

482
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:37,169
it to graphene uh because he said J son

483
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:39,809
then we can continue to feed the

484
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:44,309
statistics for the different processes

485
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:49,408
that we cover there's also an individual

486
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:53,850
service for each and every analysis in J

487
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:59,659
son in case you want to integrate with

488
00:33:53,850 --> 00:34:03,149
us well we've got this other prettier

489
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:07,110
display it gives you information about

490
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:09,739
time about the different details using

491
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:12,480
you could access this and then work

492
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:16,500
automatically what about the proof of

493
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:20,909
concepts with a hat we've prepared an

494
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:24,060
add-on for Firefox to be able to connect

495
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:29,250
up to the surveys and do the reports so

496
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:33,960
when we visit a URL and how do you know

497
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:36,359
well this is the URIs icon with the

498
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:43,470
percentage you see 25% for this website

499
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:46,589
must rent this one 87% it's it appears

500
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:50,098
as amber and green for this one because

501
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:53,699
the total score is 100 percent so as you

502
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:56,760
browse and visit different web sites you

503
00:34:53,699 --> 00:35:00,810
this tells you how much you should trust

504
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,990
that particular website now for the

505
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:04,740
website where the score was 100 percent

506
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,290
this

507
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:10,649
is the report it would be great to

508
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:12,119
continue to develop this tool which is a

509
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,570
bit of a shame when when you do

510
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:18,600
something like this at a competition

511
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:21,000
like a hackathon you might come up with

512
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:24,569
an interesting project like this and who

513
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:28,400
knows and some organization in C Bay for

514
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:34,020
instance might be keen on helping this

515
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:41,760
go further because imagine if the system

516
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:46,190
gives you a 100% score in that case the

517
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,619
system could offer you like a quality

518
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:55,020
label that your website could display

519
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:57,990
just to tell surfers that you comply

520
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:00,650
with the URIs requirements I think

521
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,649
that's about it

522
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:10,819
so that's all from us thank you very

523
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:20,240
much for your attention and all the best

524
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:23,690
for the rest of the team's well because

525
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,189
you have just over a minute left can I

526
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:32,270
ask you a question could you show us ads

527
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:37,609
internally how the plugins work how they

528
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:40,480
check detection for the final score to

529
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:40,480
be calculated

530
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:56,779
I mentioned earlier that there's this

531
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:59,709
area here for config settings for

532
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:59,709
instance for cookies

533
00:36:59,979 --> 00:37:07,399
that's a manual process it has to be at

534
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:09,619
the moment I mean it could be then that

535
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,140
in the future there might be something

536
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:14,989
like in 90 hours and where updates they

537
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:18,919
are automated and then the plugins are

538
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:28,849
here they're independent let's have a

539
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:32,150
look at the LSSI one we get the driver

540
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:38,359
that is the instance we sent to selenium

541
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:46,309
then comes back for that website that's

542
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:50,179
processed to find links that are defined

543
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:56,929
in the config file in this case we've

544
00:37:50,179 --> 00:38:04,150
got these three so when you visit when

545
00:37:56,929 --> 00:38:08,959
it visits those three it then searches

546
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:12,439
for keywords we have included those here

547
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:21,229
that's the number of the particular law

548
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:23,719
the trade registration those formal

549
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:27,979
details and if those criteria are

550
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:31,549
complied with that's when the 100% score

551
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:39,019
is calculated well and this is where the

552
00:38:31,549 --> 00:38:41,259
message is waited for the final report

553
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:44,390
and here are the functions one

554
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:46,640
processing on the basis of the different

555
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:49,759
links I showed you at the beginning and

556
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:54,009
the other one loading the configuration

557
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:54,009
great thank you very much for that

558
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,849
it's see we net the next team

559
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,700
çb net air the next team the Tigers

560
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:14,240
let's start then with a presentation of

561
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:18,890
this demo and showing you how far we've

562
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:25,629
got our main objectives for this project

563
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:29,450
were security because it's resource

564
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:32,780
intensive we need a lot of memory a lot

565
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:35,899
of CPU resources and in order to improve

566
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:39,890
that we want to focus on performance and

567
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:42,920
on a distributed solution in different

568
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:51,920
layers and with feedback so that we can

569
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:55,880
have a network device with a layer how

570
00:40:51,920 --> 00:41:02,000
far did we get for more security we have

571
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:04,910
managed to communicate as so that if an

572
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,800
attack takes place and it's identified

573
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:12,500
and that will be like an HTTP request

574
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:18,650
without a host and if that condition is

575
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:25,190
messy the system finds the clients IP

576
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:29,900
and that is fed into the system on NF TB

577
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:33,200
we have this property with whitelists

578
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:37,880
and blacklists and also traffic

579
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:44,359
limitation and have the threshold for

580
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:48,740
each origin IP we've also got functional

581
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:53,660
tests to then see if the protection is

582
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:57,649
actually working during the tests we

583
00:41:53,660 --> 00:42:00,160
have checked the scripts we have created

584
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:03,160
the scripts sorry for pen testing and

585
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,160
verification

586
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:10,340
we have and to see the efficiency and we

587
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:14,270
have managed to have a tool that behaves

588
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:16,700
in a distributed manner as if different

589
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:22,009
users were connected at the same time

590
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:26,779
we've also tried to use new libraries

591
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:30,280
we'll see which ones later on the

592
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:38,570
extraction when the extraction went fast

593
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:43,310
here we can see lib nml lib nft and live

594
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:46,550
n ft tables those were the libraries

595
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:52,850
that we've used we have compiled the

596
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:56,570
load balancer for n f TB and we've also

597
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:59,089
worked at the backend these are the new

598
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:03,410
parameters that we've added to the API

599
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:06,950
we've identified them with the values

600
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:09,379
and the demo will later show which ones

601
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:13,939
they are and how they work we have used

602
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:16,940
different objects a guest and post we've

603
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:19,970
identified them what problems did we

604
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:24,560
encounter we have used technologies that

605
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:28,939
are still under development life because

606
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:31,600
we want to help the community use some

607
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:36,650
of the new libraries we've also

608
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:39,920
communicated from a wife to the API we

609
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:43,880
have managed to have an SSH tunnel so

610
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:48,020
that information can go more securely we

611
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:51,190
have also found new proposals for

612
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:53,960
attacks for TOS later we will see how

613
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:58,180
although that was not our main objective

614
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,800
we don't want to have a seventh layer

615
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,839
objective but how we had a little bit of

616
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,270
time and we had to we try to improve

617
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:10,220
that side of things as well as my

618
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:15,170
colleague was saying what we found about

619
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:19,279
a evil Regis is that mod security has to

620
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:22,849
for configuration one that limits the

621
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,730
maximum size for the fire so we can

622
00:44:22,849 --> 00:44:29,510
either process that amount or reject it

623
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:32,240
we have also managed to define the

624
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:35,809
maximum number of matches that can be

625
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:39,649
found with a generic expression and then

626
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:44,290
on Apache - we've got keep alive time

627
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:47,540
out that means we don't allow for

628
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:50,839
connections that are over the timeout

629
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:52,839
time so if an attacker wants to send

630
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:58,279
very large attp

631
00:44:52,839 --> 00:45:03,109
requests the system will stop that now

632
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:06,369
what about future developments for the

633
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:12,049
future we want to migrate the solution

634
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:15,140
to ssh supported by HTTP we want to

635
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:17,780
generate the api key which is more

636
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:20,720
robust and also the hardening of the

637
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:22,970
load software which is going to quickly

638
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,439
show you the demo just for you to get an

639
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:28,430
idea how it works

640
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:32,210
just for sites here we have the client

641
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:38,180
site where we simulate a connections to

642
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:41,170
those two IPS connecting on to one which

643
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:45,098
so far only called the packets and

644
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:48,500
distributed them acquitted equitably

645
00:45:45,099 --> 00:45:51,650
between the two different arms I'm going

646
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,920
to show you a one of the attacks that we

647
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:59,420
managed to stop the flux one and then

648
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:02,420
another attack to send up get protection

649
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:06,230
that will be identified as malicious at

650
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:10,490
the server side and that will inform the

651
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:13,369
load balancer for the request to be

652
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:15,790
included within the blacklist so let's

653
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:15,790
go for it

654
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:34,510
so don't worry that we can't see the big

655
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:38,520
screen we've got the smaller screens on

656
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:42,760
the side so forget about the larger side

657
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:52,930
not having big time sorry a big enough

658
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:54,850
letter type one of the participating in

659
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:57,790
a party superior to name the cleantech

660
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:59,740
on the top side you have the claims

661
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:01,990
getting the connections and then the

662
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:05,770
bottom side that it cannot see because I

663
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:08,669
will focus on the top side of it so that

664
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:08,670
I can extend it

665
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:58,529
my lip went off the hockey put to

666
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:06,720
another Louis have you got it this is

667
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:08,880
one of the surface you've got here so

668
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,339
here you have the load balancer I have

669
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,730
the set of bready I'm showing this to

670
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:19,619
you I'm sharing it with you here you

671
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:23,760
have the current configuration on Jason

672
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:27,559
we have a virtual server and default we

673
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:32,940
have a 500 limit and the bust limit is 5

674
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:37,079
then on the other hand this is our web

675
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:40,920
client which sends connections

676
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:45,299
concurrently at 50 so here you have this

677
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:48,180
short clip and you will see how 50

678
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:54,299
connections are spread with other

679
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:58,399
servers see the server going up we will

680
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:58,400
get some 50 connections on either side

681
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:05,490
this is my system where identified that

682
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:08,759
there is a TIA vs. hack here is my IP

683
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:11,069
ready the API that is and it will move

684
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:18,440
over 500 there's a volley I've loaded

685
00:49:11,069 --> 00:49:18,440
and I set it at 5 I call the device

686
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:25,210
and you see the values though it means

687
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:27,250
that this is decreasing so we change

688
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:31,090
connections and so we see that this

689
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:33,460
value will be at five and we've realized

690
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:37,350
that the value of 60 concurrent

691
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:41,290
connections and here we stopped at five

692
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:44,920
this is the 60 second time there's about

693
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:48,120
this fire this is the first EOS and the

694
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:52,120
work it states that we've changed X

695
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:55,420
connections in or within those 60

696
00:49:52,120 --> 00:50:02,069
seconds this would protect us from do s

697
00:49:55,420 --> 00:50:02,070
attacks and then this other attack

698
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:33,620
so these are black layers that I'm

699
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:38,200
loading same as before but this is a

700
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:41,200
black list so the back ends can check it

701
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,200
here

702
00:50:52,970 --> 00:51:09,279
I just got this request here and if I

703
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:12,470
tried next time

704
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,780
NFC list and right now this is a

705
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:18,618
blacklist

706
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:21,650
karyam 5780 the device is there so I

707
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:24,530
cannot get on until 10 seconds from now

708
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:26,690
that is the brief thief predefined

709
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,839
volumes and now that I got the blacklist

710
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:47,329
I can use the system and gain access to

711
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:49,160
the system and that's all so so if we

712
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:52,040
stick to time is that an extra point

713
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:54,200
well I think about that you need to know

714
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:57,290
that I'm having a terrible time here but

715
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,740
I'm forced you controlling time sorry

716
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,740
about that

717
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:15,319
Tigers Tigers Tigers Lions Lions Lions

718
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:15,860
I'm an old-fashioned guy next one get

719
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,400
ready

720
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,400
fish and chips

721
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:37,450
fish and chips are you ready then fish

722
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:41,670
and chips for my year reason it's health

723
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:41,669
reason so we move on to the next group

724
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:51,070
good afternoon everyone we're fish and

725
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:55,060
chips we've developed fast fish for

726
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:57,100
efficient detection large-scale as the

727
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:00,460
competition started we said we would be

728
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:02,440
working on these items minimum domain

729
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,660
collection minimum structures you cannot

730
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,720
find fishing under unless you find new

731
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:09,700
domains also analysis a structure you

732
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,589
need to sorry structure analysis because

733
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,149
you need to look into the data there's

734
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:15,490
no point in mining data when you don't

735
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:17,320
make the most of them and then on demand

736
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:19,540
request you need to have the data but

737
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:22,690
someone needs to check them or at least

738
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:24,279
check them in an accessible way and we

739
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:27,460
will also have a database integration

740
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:30,010
we're interested in persistence finding

741
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:34,060
if it's 15 seconds and the program stops

742
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:36,070
and this is a 24/7 and then basic module

743
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:38,740
compatibility so people can add their

744
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:41,470
prioritized solutions or contribute to

745
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:44,910
it in any way we think if we've nailed

746
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:47,799
it but we have a minimum collection

747
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:51,370
structure basically it's worth pausing

748
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:53,680
or it's a difficult certificate parsing

749
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:56,740
also minimum structure analysis we

750
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,690
follow something like Hamming distance

751
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,000
or some minimum trick on demand request

752
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:03,700
or structure we have to api's Express

753
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,220
one is HTTP for coming users and then

754
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:08,950
one on jeep RPC for high performance

755
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:11,770
minimum integration with databases here

756
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:14,020
using ret is because it's easier because

757
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:17,200
it's widely tested and only rarely it

758
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:19,570
will cause trouble and money module

759
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,600
communication with it we said it is G

760
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:25,420
RPC protocol buffer so that is agnostic

761
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,670
if you want a module impatient or Java

762
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,470
or whatever you can as learners protocol

763
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:32,320
buffers has a compiler to throw the

764
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:35,140
language and the protocol buffers that

765
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,810
we distribute are used our program will

766
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:39,940
get the message we've also added some

767
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:43,029
more things that we did not introduce at

768
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:45,100
first such as TLS communication these is

769
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:47,500
a cyber security competition so it would

770
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:50,350
be pointless to have an unsecure

771
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:51,920
communication - we use CLS for both

772
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:54,290
sides

773
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:57,200
communication and client communication

774
00:55:54,290 --> 00:56:01,009
both modules internally need a TLS in

775
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:04,430
case you host the tool on Google cloud

776
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:06,800
or AWS or a zoo so no one can read it

777
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:08,120
and then client communication our

778
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,670
communication between client and server

779
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:13,670
needs to be closed as well

780
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:15,530
we've also added add-on JS and modules

781
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:18,140
could be any other format but we chosen

782
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:20,960
change them because it's simpler number

783
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:25,160
of cells sources for certificate

784
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:28,160
transparency also diffused logic to see

785
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,589
whether it is anything like it and some

786
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:34,580
collectors here the certificate

787
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:38,780
transparency is generic so if it matches

788
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:40,819
our FCC we can use it then we also have

789
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:43,430
a website with the data sets of the

790
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:45,590
domains recorded today the day before

791
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:48,049
today and a few more days before today

792
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:53,120
or just by reading a file that you can

793
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:56,600
parse a generic interface technologies

794
00:56:53,120 --> 00:57:00,560
we've used D RPC and protocol buffers

795
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:03,560
for communication is agnostic also go

796
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:06,080
for this purpose because we like it it's

797
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:08,690
simple and concurrency is cheaper than

798
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,340
other languages and that it is

799
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:14,240
multi-platform and relish for the

800
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:17,210
database because it's simpler next we'll

801
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:20,109
try to run a live demo it'll be my

802
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:20,110
colleague to answer

803
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:37,280
as my colleague said every connect

804
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:38,720
connection is TLS protected we have some

805
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,520
certificates as part of the project

806
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,520
naturally these are sign

807
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:58,890
aren't without a valid key but it works

808
00:57:51,640 --> 00:58:01,930
for the demo here we have the binary

809
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:04,240
that is useful the filed we'll be using

810
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:06,730
that later and we also have the setup

811
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,979
the convicts that we discuss our

812
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:15,010
colleague discussed and I say it's been

813
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:22,150
saying we have Reddy's as a database and

814
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:30,160
let me show you what it has now there

815
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:32,470
are a few domains already uploaded first

816
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,328
we start the database module it's old

817
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:37,149
modular we said that those are different

818
00:58:34,329 --> 00:58:39,250
binary codes and we could start that on

819
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,549
different servers a different computers

820
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:46,420
same one doesn't matter we've already

821
00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:49,329
got the config there we got the API

822
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:52,660
ready which would be the access point

823
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:56,680
for any user or outside software the

824
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:58,569
first name i'll i'll run is one of the

825
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:03,700
api's that we've implemented through

826
00:58:58,569 --> 00:59:09,819
HTTP on cur is open and connected to the

827
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:12,489
api and we also

828
00:59:09,819 --> 00:59:14,709
and the module to be analyzed that is

829
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:19,900
using this algorithm similar to Hammonds

830
00:59:14,709 --> 00:59:21,910
and we can use it for domain analysis we

831
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:26,049
send the curled request

832
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:29,609
we checked whether it's Twitter or

833
00:59:26,049 --> 00:59:33,930
Twitter like and see if this is phishing

834
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:39,549
we send it and it says probably fishing

835
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:41,979
it's a 90% confidence interval and it's

836
00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:43,719
been received by the analyzer which

837
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:46,180
check it accounts domains that we've set

838
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:49,319
up and see what domains were born to

839
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:52,538
look for for example if we're a company

840
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:58,839
we can set our domain to look fishing I

841
00:59:52,539 --> 01:00:00,880
went I guess I would company and you say

842
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:01,739
this is fishing against Twitter for all

843
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,509
others

844
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:10,180
the score is way too low and here

845
01:00:06,509 --> 01:00:12,299
everything's gone through HTTP as we've

846
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:15,098
done before locked in tej

847
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:19,509
gone through the API because it was a

848
01:00:15,099 --> 01:00:25,440
user and then if we go back through

849
01:00:19,509 --> 01:00:33,430
Redis it's been stored into the database

850
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:37,450
see that the score is there if I

851
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:40,000
send it again nothing's change they will

852
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:41,379
not lose waste any time on analyzing it

853
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:50,890
it just got this cool that we had

854
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:53,230
already saved if we sent a request to

855
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:56,078
have valid domain it'll say this is

856
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:58,260
envisioned because Twitter is a valid to

857
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,260
mean

858
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:18,780
we also have a client with the API for

859
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:24,180
example an email scans of words and then

860
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:27,030
of the kind and we send it there is this

861
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:29,160
battery that we've program ourselves but

862
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,270
this is definitely more we would not use

863
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:34,529
it

864
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:36,270
this is Twitter we've seen it we just

865
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:39,510
got the score from our database

866
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:44,579
everything else facebook.com or every

867
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:52,310
comes been locked into same here keeps

868
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:55,140
him here if we try it again this is not

869
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:57,410
analyzes and database that no need to go

870
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,410
through it

871
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:13,640
these were all on-demand requests this

872
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:16,720
is also a collection module let me show

873
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:20,000
the certificate transparency to you and

874
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:24,230
I'll cut it off because it's running on

875
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:27,710
my mobile Wi-Fi so just a few seconds

876
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:29,869
and stop bet and you get all the domains

877
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:30,920
compared them against those where we

878
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:34,359
wanted to check whether they were

879
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:38,750
fishing or not we were unlucky here

880
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:41,598
because they weren't fishing they polled

881
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:45,950
burning through here actually the

882
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:52,070
repeats it didn't analyze them again

883
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:54,970
they are on database and see that

884
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:54,970
they've all been checked

885
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:13,919
well we've met every goal here so we

886
01:03:11,069 --> 01:03:15,808
just need to have more analyzers but we

887
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,630
have an interface that can be used for

888
01:03:15,809 --> 01:03:20,819
any language so it would be negligible

889
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:24,089
more collectors same we have the

890
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:28,680
certificate transparency so database

891
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:34,020
files easy to implement more API as

892
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:35,669
we've seen just 2g RPC and HTTP we can

893
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:39,299
also implement some kind of a cache that

894
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:42,619
is half way implemented but we need to

895
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:45,960
have one that is more efficient a deeper

896
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:49,770
configuration because we have one as my

897
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:53,609
colleague explained we can set some

898
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:57,930
variables but we would need to set some

899
01:03:53,609 --> 01:04:01,200
of the ports to start services and also

900
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:04,910
an automatic diplay the deploy if we

901
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:13,319
wanted to use it at home as well

902
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:13,319
[Applause]

903
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:32,180
never was perfecto

904
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:40,279
tigress power alone next Tigers and then

905
01:04:37,279 --> 01:04:40,279
so

906
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:04,940
but one of the other most eligible

907
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:09,078
degrees

908
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:15,529
we had Tigers and our product is error

909
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:19,999
hit in case you don't remember it's an

910
01:05:15,529 --> 01:05:23,749
improvement on air crack Sylvia boom mmm

911
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:27,019
and myself ricotta we were starting from

912
01:05:23,749 --> 01:05:30,019
scratch we had not written any code so

913
01:05:27,019 --> 01:05:32,899
we had to make some changes for example

914
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:36,589
data captured from the suggestions we

915
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:38,989
got we've been using air crack that's

916
01:05:36,589 --> 01:05:42,880
the name of the project the name we were

917
01:05:38,989 --> 01:05:46,819
taken after and then these are the two

918
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,920
this well known on Wi-Fi and then we had

919
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:51,319
so many problems with the graph

920
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,900
libraries for JavaScript for the heat

921
01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:57,589
maps because we had the idea that we

922
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:59,989
would use a leaflet but then we ended up

923
01:05:57,589 --> 01:06:01,029
using Google Maps and I'll explain in a

924
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:05,269
minute

925
01:06:01,029 --> 01:06:16,099
we had some trouble with a server for

926
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:21,410
Python so data captured it has two entry

927
01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:22,089
points where we change would we've

928
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:26,828
captured

929
01:06:22,089 --> 01:06:30,109
second-by-second on gps on a csv file

930
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:32,269
that's the one that we treat and process

931
01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:35,808
and move into the database and then we

932
01:06:32,269 --> 01:06:38,808
have quiche mints a facial output even

933
01:06:35,809 --> 01:06:40,759
though it's way more fruity as we can

934
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:43,069
use it for heat maps with our tool and

935
01:06:40,759 --> 01:06:46,160
see all the tables with everything

936
01:06:43,069 --> 01:06:49,910
having to do with that because well

937
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:54,160
actually we wanted to go further and

938
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:56,720
keep information on clients and all

939
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:59,118
second-by-second for client monitoring

940
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:02,049
or projects a bit more focused on

941
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:05,049
clients which you cannot have with

942
01:07:02,049 --> 01:07:05,049
kismet

943
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:14,630
so as I was saying it is a kiss miss

944
01:07:11,759 --> 01:07:18,930
baised capture so we didn't have to

945
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:21,059
touch it just a python script so it

946
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:25,348
reads the file and goes into a database

947
01:07:21,059 --> 01:07:29,460
and then the aircrack change on written

948
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:32,130
in c and we added two outputs one for IP

949
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:34,920
another one for client which is a csv

950
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:41,789
with the GPS position every time is

951
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:44,400
found so these are two python scripts

952
01:07:41,789 --> 01:07:49,579
that greet the files and save them to

953
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,579
the database the database do you have it

954
01:07:54,380 --> 01:08:01,470
so this one here that's the database we

955
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:04,078
have the IP and the client tables and

956
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:05,999
the relationship between which is

957
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:11,130
connections and then the probes in every

958
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:16,769
client and then the aps and the clients

959
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:18,810
were never seen so this database is not

960
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:23,460
complete when we have not feel every

961
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:25,650
field and that's one of the to-do items

962
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:30,109
but what we are most interested in for

963
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:30,108
this project for this stage it's on here

964
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:38,880
some that so these are SQL query is

965
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:41,270
quite simple that help us recover

966
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,270
information

967
01:08:47,149 --> 01:08:57,049
we have four drawers done that is

968
01:08:52,698 --> 01:09:00,858
database production we can produce

969
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:03,109
several result which is most visual and

970
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:08,210
that's what the client will see for the

971
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:12,230
web app we've used a node server we were

972
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:14,359
using a back-end on C sharp but we were

973
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:16,698
in trouble because we were not familiar

974
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:19,100
with it and so we moved to node which

975
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:22,149
seems simple and yielded us better

976
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,150
results on faster results

977
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:27,759
apart from J JavaScript

978
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:34,488
it says JavaScript framers well it's

979
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:39,949
actually CSS frame prayer framers with

980
01:09:34,488 --> 01:09:42,620
use admin and bootstrap and then the

981
01:09:39,948 --> 01:09:47,689
graphic libraries to show the results

982
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:53,469
for the interface and the result

983
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:53,469
displayed let me play the demo for you

984
01:09:56,469 --> 01:10:03,159
as you can see there's an interface

985
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:11,690
on the left side you can choose access

986
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:14,719
point information collected client

987
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:18,889
information collected or heat map

988
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:22,219
generation so if you move here you can

989
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:25,699
see and choose the name of the network

990
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:29,530
that we audit him let's say this is a

991
01:10:25,699 --> 01:10:35,239
pentesters view with that Wi-Fi audit

992
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:38,300
when we click here we see data at first

993
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:40,190
we only had our as as I and so we were

994
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,860
suggested she has set the average the

995
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:47,120
maximum the minimum that we see here and

996
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:49,219
same time but from born how we've done

997
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:52,070
it with the name we can also use the MAC

998
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:55,850
address in case we were looking for

999
01:10:52,070 --> 01:11:00,230
information for a specific access point

1000
01:10:55,850 --> 01:11:01,880
and just like this now we only have

1001
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:06,160
these few results but we could add a few

1002
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:11,390
more same way sure

1003
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:15,519
same way we can find all the information

1004
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:20,570
we can gather from clients we choose

1005
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:24,580
clients this is the first one but as you

1006
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:27,710
can see in the traffic capture we had

1007
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:31,809
their database produce has many

1008
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:36,940
different types of networks

1009
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:36,940
this is cyber camps and there you see

1010
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:44,860
that's the route MAC address routed

1011
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:44,860
macros used the client ID and the time

1012
01:11:44,949 --> 01:11:49,428
this is all Wi-Fi because well as you

1013
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:54,620
will see what it is we could not include

1014
01:11:49,429 --> 01:11:58,239
the Bluetooth here you will also have

1015
01:11:54,620 --> 01:12:00,699
them up heap heat maps are a generation

1016
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:02,530
and we've been using google maps as we

1017
01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:06,369
said mainly because it was a suggestion

1018
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:11,130
and also because we had some problems

1019
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:11,130
with leaf left that we had chosen here

1020
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:30,848
just in case it doesn't work we prepare

1021
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:30,849
the video

1022
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:49,800
a formal video yes even from a video or

1023
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:51,930
just because of time constraints we're

1024
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,570
going to play the video instead instead

1025
01:12:51,930 --> 01:13:03,300
the name of the network in this case

1026
01:12:54,570 --> 01:13:06,120
cyber camp and now we can see what role

1027
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:08,490
has done he's the one who was in charge

1028
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:12,120
of the capture we didn't have time for

1029
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:16,340
the legend but look at those areas in

1030
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:23,280
red which is where the RSSI value is

1031
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:26,370
higher where the root was in the

1032
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:30,000
building or a roundish well you can see

1033
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:32,280
it in a very visual manner you can have

1034
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:39,120
different modes satellite mode or

1035
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:46,650
straight street view you see this is our

1036
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:51,000
building Avenue for cyber camp so in the

1037
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:54,929
past we were selecting tables for the

1038
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:58,350
different names or the MAC address so if

1039
01:13:54,930 --> 01:14:05,460
we look for information of a particular

1040
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:08,480
router look at that that corner there it

1041
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:12,990
says that's the router we're looking for

1042
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:17,790
so if in a particular organization or

1043
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:20,700
the routers are the same brand and in

1044
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:24,210
our inventory we see that in a MAC

1045
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:28,410
address the bytes are look different on

1046
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:32,810
the beginning then we can find it so

1047
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:32,809
that's about it for the interface

1048
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:42,900
what else would we like to do Raoul said

1049
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:50,100
it the database could have more fields

1050
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:53,370
so that we could have more details about

1051
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:58,500
the maps we didn't have time to include

1052
01:14:53,370 --> 01:15:01,620
the legend having the different paths

1053
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:04,980
for the dots but we did do it and for

1054
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:11,190
the other library leafless let me just

1055
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:18,089
quickly show you you see the different

1056
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:20,669
points that Raoul covered where the

1057
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:25,199
samples were taken and we have the

1058
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:30,300
coordinates and the RSSI value that

1059
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:32,219
could be added to Google Maps and last

1060
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:35,100
but not least err we still need to add

1061
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:37,199
their Bluetooth module so that's all

1062
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:39,270
from us we want to thank you for your

1063
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,860
attention and we'll be happy to answer

1064
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:45,250
any questions you may have

1065
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:48,170
[Applause]

1066
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:51,050
just as a reminder we will have a

1067
01:15:48,170 --> 01:15:53,840
general Q&A session for all the teams

1068
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:57,320
and that's why we're first listening to

1069
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:00,020
the presentations no questions we did

1070
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:01,820
leave time for just one question in the

1071
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:05,740
case of the one team that has still had

1072
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:10,990
time to spare presentation time that is

1073
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:10,990
can we now hear from uber newbs

1074
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:16,180
No

1075
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:28,510
CPC who uses your premium provider

1076
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,490
it's really annoying because it works

1077
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:35,550
beautifully this morning I was the first

1078
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:35,550
one to test it and it worked just fine

1079
01:17:42,990 --> 01:18:03,940
now it's what it works

1080
01:17:45,510 --> 01:18:06,640
don't touch anything good afternoon

1081
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:10,990
everyone this is the name of our team

1082
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:15,070
zell i'm alvaro even and myself we are

1083
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:18,330
together we're studying a university and

1084
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:24,219
we find that sometimes a universities

1085
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:28,090
have certain rules and just to improve

1086
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:32,130
the situation we have developed stock

1087
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:36,670
this is a tool to provide safety to

1088
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:41,790
systems admin admins and to users in

1089
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:45,430
this case it could be a facility in at

1090
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:50,260
university maybe a laboratory we want in

1091
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:53,800
the systems admin has the safety that

1092
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:55,990
ports won't be open by default but

1093
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:59,680
rather for them to open as needed

1094
01:18:55,990 --> 01:19:02,580
through port knocking mechanism and also

1095
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:07,030
users students in this case having a

1096
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:10,260
factors for double authentication we

1097
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:10,259
prepared a demo for you

1098
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:41,299
here we have a users registration screen

1099
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:43,309
you see let's say yes a van my name that

1100
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:47,350
would be the screen for registration

1101
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:50,570
we then activate the double

1102
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:54,950
authentication for the QR code or the

1103
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:58,940
rather the OTP key to be activated for

1104
01:19:54,950 --> 01:20:01,340
that particular student we scan the QR

1105
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:03,710
code and it's a shame you can't see my

1106
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:09,680
mobile phone now but it shows me a code

1107
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:16,190
that refreshes regularly for us to

1108
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:18,230
verify and I'm the only one who can

1109
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:21,049
verify that on the application because

1110
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:26,000
it's my mobile phone that's where I have

1111
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:33,950
this code I keep getting these codes so

1112
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:40,640
let me access with an admin user admin

1113
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:42,460
of the platform that is right this is

1114
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:46,210
the user

1115
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:55,530
that is going to let us access whichever

1116
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:59,140
machine my logging was even three and

1117
01:20:55,530 --> 01:21:02,679
that's how I let the machine that I

1118
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:11,950
selected earlier be accessed

1119
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:17,760
now I log out my admin and then I log in

1120
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:27,070
with a normal user it then asks me again

1121
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:32,010
to identify myself right as the log in

1122
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:36,719
done and see how I can now access the

1123
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:43,980
machine that I selected as systems admin

1124
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:48,400
so I then download here across a client

1125
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:51,730
for that machine and I then download the

1126
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:57,280
profile for that machine this is the

1127
01:21:51,730 --> 01:22:01,919
profile with user details which then

1128
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:05,230
connect up with the supervisors

1129
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:07,000
information so that through SSH or

1130
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:12,218
whichever other surveys I can then

1131
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:18,610
access the machine so let's see how this

1132
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:23,890
works how the port knocking can request

1133
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:28,150
works this administration portal doesn't

1134
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:30,940
assure actually handle the machines

1135
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:35,080
it just has information on users the

1136
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:38,469
mapping so the infrastructure admin

1137
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:42,160
would be in charge of all the rest on

1138
01:22:38,469 --> 01:22:46,030
demand so of course the template which I

1139
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:49,300
downloaded and here I can run stock

1140
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:54,809
which is the name for the administration

1141
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:54,810
was that code right now at this time

1142
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:08,290
right I've typed in the codes and this

1143
01:23:05,139 --> 01:23:13,030
is the top the supervisor who gets the

1144
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:16,260
package given by the firewall so we can

1145
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:23,469
then identify the poor knocking sequence

1146
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:27,579
and get the token then with details on

1147
01:23:23,469 --> 01:23:32,469
the public password and the user name

1148
01:23:27,579 --> 01:23:34,659
and this is the response ah

1149
01:23:32,469 --> 01:23:38,949
it tells me that that the code has been

1150
01:23:34,659 --> 01:23:42,570
refreshed which is the new one six seven

1151
01:23:38,949 --> 01:23:42,570
oh right

1152
01:23:48,079 --> 01:24:00,709
has it expired again well apologies we

1153
01:23:57,539 --> 01:24:00,709
need to be fast here man

1154
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:18,630
well this just shows how is not easy

1155
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:21,520
pretending to be somebody else you need

1156
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:24,130
to be faster with those codes that

1157
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:30,070
aren't refreshed all the time so the

1158
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:32,980
supervisor doesn't act on itself but on

1159
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:37,210
the machines and that I want to be

1160
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:43,709
accessed through firewall rules the

1161
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:49,080
window opens and then jointly it

1162
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:49,080
administrates the public keys so that

1163
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:57,820
access can be granted without the need

1164
01:24:52,570 --> 01:25:01,030
for a password so all of this the

1165
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:04,179
settings can be changed we can also use

1166
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:07,920
a NIC to access the machine for instance

1167
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:11,980
I'm going to now access through SSH I

1168
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:19,360
should have access here let me just go

1169
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:23,379
back to the presentation a moment let's

1170
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:33,519
see if it lets me show you the

1171
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:36,400
presentation up on the screen now these

1172
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:40,870
are the technologies that we've used

1173
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:45,549
Ruby and Python Python mostly for the

1174
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:51,550
clients Graper and then connections are

1175
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:53,620
done through sockets not with KP or we

1176
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:56,830
didn't think that would be correct or

1177
01:25:53,620 --> 01:26:00,490
even feasible and then what about this

1178
01:25:56,830 --> 01:26:03,820
supervisor level we did you skip it as

1179
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:12,550
KP there for interpretation and then

1180
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:15,099
Ruby mostly for authentication to work

1181
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:20,800
with the users to check that the key is

1182
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:23,200
correct so all of that works on HTTPS so

1183
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:28,450
the supervisor there would be checking

1184
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:31,599
if the key is correct the key that's

1185
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:34,480
generated regularly all of that has been

1186
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:39,510
done just with virtual machines we

1187
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:43,509
wanted to make it nice and simple so

1188
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:45,690
this is the more detailed explanation of

1189
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:50,580
the sequence how it works

1190
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:53,830
it tends to work at on different ports

1191
01:26:50,580 --> 01:27:00,220
from firewall that forwards to the

1192
01:26:53,830 --> 01:27:03,910
supervisor the packets so they can be

1193
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:08,950
identified as port knocking once that is

1194
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:12,450
identified then the side gate is open

1195
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:15,690
for the token to be sent logically

1196
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:20,290
encrypted and with a certain integrity

1197
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:23,980
so that the supervisor can then work

1198
01:27:20,290 --> 01:27:26,670
with administration of those keys after

1199
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:26,669
a certain time

1200
01:27:27,890 --> 01:27:34,830
because this is a hackathon we wanted to

1201
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:38,580
analyze a vulnerability x' and there's

1202
01:27:34,830 --> 01:27:41,790
one main vulnerability here it would be

1203
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:44,670
the authentication server that's the

1204
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:47,100
only element that users can access

1205
01:27:44,670 --> 01:27:53,610
directly so that would be the main

1206
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:57,120
target 42 attacks our system is not

1207
01:27:53,610 --> 01:28:01,650
compromised because you can't access the

1208
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:05,220
machines the authentication server when

1209
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:07,379
it crashes it can't identify if the keys

1210
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:11,660
are correct so you wouldn't be able to

1211
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:14,100
login the rest of the infrastructure is

1212
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:17,250
protected as I said because the user

1213
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:19,980
doesn't have access to machines because

1214
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:24,440
the ports are not open and because the

1215
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:24,440
machines delegate all the traffic

1216
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:33,120
so what about possible future

1217
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:37,380
improvements we would have to

1218
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:44,160
double-check details and members of the

1219
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:46,980
jury mentioned that some detail should

1220
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:49,950
be improved but we will also would like

1221
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:54,389
to have a new authentication system for

1222
01:28:49,950 --> 01:29:00,330
instance the Phaedo key I believe he

1223
01:28:54,390 --> 01:29:02,490
said we have implemented the key but for

1224
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:04,740
the moment only for the client

1225
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:08,130
application that connects up to the

1226
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:13,500
machines we should still work on us

1227
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:15,630
but at the supervisors level what else

1228
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:19,310
can we say well we've had a such a good

1229
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:22,500
time it's been a wonderful experience

1230
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:25,400
being here for these few days thank you

1231
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:25,400
very much to all of you

1232
01:29:42,869 --> 01:29:51,320
you see now continue with uber newbs and

1233
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:51,320
the following team will be security bag

1234
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:34,909
I think

1235
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:59,620
[Music]

1236
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:07,540
right our team has developed the blue

1237
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:10,180
fingerprint application

1238
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:15,370
well we haven't quite finished it we

1239
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:20,980
only got half way through we have been

1240
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:27,580
using the age co6 module that we can see

1241
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:29,980
up on the screen what are the different

1242
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:34,240
stages of the communication that we've

1243
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:36,730
been developing my project was actually

1244
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:39,400
more complex than we originally thought

1245
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:43,299
so that's what we found has been the

1246
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:45,820
first conclusion the idea is that a

1247
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:51,250
message is sent from the mobile phone

1248
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:55,690
from the Arduino to the Arduino with a

1249
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:58,270
fourth username if everything works the

1250
01:31:55,690 --> 01:32:03,700
request gets there and if it's been

1251
01:31:58,270 --> 01:32:10,080
saved and then a challenge will take

1252
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:15,580
place then a deciphered number or

1253
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:18,160
decoded number plus one would go one way

1254
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:20,860
and Arduino would then sent a message

1255
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:26,590
send the message as well that we have

1256
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:28,950
verified a with a LED and led there are

1257
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:32,440
different modes for opening and closing

1258
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:35,349
but unfortunately we have time no time

1259
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:38,790
to finish that we've prepared a video

1260
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:38,790
for a use case

1261
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:50,710
this is the list of defined devices you

1262
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:55,119
can see how it starts stops blinking I

1263
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:57,730
didn't say I'm a master we then get a

1264
01:32:55,119 --> 01:33:00,759
challenge we then send then the

1265
01:32:57,730 --> 01:33:06,280
following 1+1 and that's when the light

1266
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:09,969
comes on so the next case is pretending

1267
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:12,280
I'm an intruder I sent a different chain

1268
01:33:09,969 --> 01:33:16,750
that hadn't been saved that means it's

1269
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:21,509
not a valid M user and that me and as a

1270
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:32,520
result we are denied access the wise LED

1271
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:36,250
means the request is being generated so

1272
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:40,949
we didn't have time to cover this stage

1273
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:44,559
this new step you press the Open button

1274
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:47,230
there's a new session started there's

1275
01:33:44,559 --> 01:33:52,929
the exchange between both ends and just

1276
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:56,610
to check they have it a new number

1277
01:33:52,929 --> 01:34:00,039
random number should be generated and

1278
01:33:56,610 --> 01:34:04,420
encrypted and the packet would be

1279
01:34:00,039 --> 01:34:08,550
encoded and decoded M to check it's

1280
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:12,400
there only the master could do this this

1281
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:18,460
has to do with a user list Arduino would

1282
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:22,780
send 1x1 messages with users under

1283
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:26,349
little finishes the file or the process

1284
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:32,679
and then the master device would then

1285
01:34:26,349 --> 01:34:37,150
send the message for delete whichever

1286
01:34:32,679 --> 01:34:38,730
number of user out of the ones you sent

1287
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:41,670
me and then

1288
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:45,660
the last step it would be from Arduino

1289
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:58,080
to the master a message for okay or not

1290
01:34:45,660 --> 01:35:02,220
okay the odd us they would work

1291
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:06,059
similarly from the master the chain the

1292
01:35:02,220 --> 01:35:09,360
string would go to the arduino and then

1293
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:11,880
depending whether the information is

1294
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:15,240
there or not or if the addition was

1295
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:21,230
correct or not the message would go back

1296
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:23,519
as okay the initialization of

1297
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:26,429
communication has a protocol that

1298
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:28,980
includes bluetooth communication which

1299
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:31,440
is very well covered then there's a

1300
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:34,349
database that's managed through Malu

1301
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:36,570
tools and because Arduino works at a

1302
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:38,400
very low level well we found that really

1303
01:35:36,570 --> 01:35:42,000
complex and we didn't have time to

1304
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:47,000
implement it user ID is correct is

1305
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:51,920
working okay and the mobile phone and

1306
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:56,750
the Arduino have been communicating fine

1307
01:35:51,920 --> 01:36:00,840
we found a way to process information

1308
01:35:56,750 --> 01:36:03,030
both at the mobile and and the Arduino

1309
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:07,680
and let's not forget that they work with

1310
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:11,519
different types of data it's always a

1311
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:15,780
streams of characters from for

1312
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:18,870
communication and then we still have to

1313
01:36:15,780 --> 01:36:20,929
work with the files for passwords and so

1314
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:22,740
on we have no time for that

1315
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:25,620
unfortunately we couldn't find

1316
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:27,840
compatible libraries at the mobile phone

1317
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:29,910
and and we still need to find an

1318
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:32,150
algorithm that works well with this

1319
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:32,150
project

1320
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:43,950
also for multi-user use of this

1321
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:48,389
application we still need to work more

1322
01:36:43,950 --> 01:36:51,090
honest a main problem has been having a

1323
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:52,950
very short time and also maybe the crude

1324
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:57,270
encrypting we should have been faster

1325
01:36:52,950 --> 01:37:01,710
with that just an idea for the future

1326
01:36:57,270 --> 01:37:04,200
would be having a time key imagine at

1327
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:06,600
the moment you need to stand close to

1328
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:08,849
the Arduino whereas in the future and it

1329
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:11,880
would be nice having different users

1330
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:14,910
with keys so they can access without

1331
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:20,060
having to be close to the Arduino

1332
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:22,650
Arduino sorry when a user is logs in

1333
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:25,020
yeah we were thinking about how

1334
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:30,750
sometimes you might otherwise have to

1335
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:35,490
lend your key to somebody for them to

1336
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:38,330
use the system first and then you would

1337
01:37:35,490 --> 01:37:42,660
need to have master signature to verify

1338
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:46,320
ID maybe we can run the demo I have

1339
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:48,500
other different stages now right let's

1340
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,500
do it

1341
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:13,610
I live in difficulty on the loose word

1342
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:19,150
in Astoria now for user ID that has to

1343
01:38:13,610 --> 01:38:22,940
be registered on the Arduino database

1344
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:25,070
that's the first one the first step and

1345
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:34,940
if that doesn't work if it's not correct

1346
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:37,969
what is the case now what happens if an

1347
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:43,759
unregistered user tried to connect up to

1348
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:48,580
the Arduino from the very beginning

1349
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:51,560
Arduino would reject the service and

1350
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:54,050
connection would restart would be

1351
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:57,830
restarted but let's imagine something

1352
01:38:54,050 --> 01:39:02,300
went wrong and communication continued

1353
01:38:57,830 --> 01:39:04,490
on to any of the following stages the

1354
01:39:02,300 --> 01:39:09,350
user has been detected as valid in this

1355
01:39:04,490 --> 01:39:12,620
case and there is a correct challenge

1356
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:17,630
response and that logically includes the

1357
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:21,830
encrypting so let's imagine I know of a

1358
01:39:17,630 --> 01:39:23,770
username that I can then cheat the

1359
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:27,010
system and pretend I'm that user

1360
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:27,010
registered user

1361
01:39:37,179 --> 01:39:42,940
go through the first level there's a

1362
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:44,920
proposal for a challenge but that's

1363
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:48,040
encrypted so I won't be able to respond

1364
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:51,730
to it correctly so there would be denial

1365
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:54,190
of service and the system would restart

1366
01:39:51,730 --> 01:40:03,549
so that's all from us thank you very

1367
01:39:54,190 --> 01:40:05,139
much for your attention can I just ask

1368
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:08,860
you a question just to make sure I

1369
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:11,320
understand about the encrypting is there

1370
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:13,389
encrypting or not because you are

1371
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:16,030
talking about challenge and response is

1372
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:18,429
that not encrypted is it just a

1373
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:21,340
challenge and response situation any

1374
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:24,330
message coming from the mobile phone

1375
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:28,600
except for the first ID message is

1376
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:31,989
encrypted with aes-256 so whichever one

1377
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:34,230
we implement eventually because we

1378
01:40:31,989 --> 01:40:37,500
haven't done it yet and for arduino

1379
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:40,120
encrypting works because we have used a

1380
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:43,030
predefined library but because javi

1381
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:46,360
works with java that doesn't allow for

1382
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:49,530
bytes and we were a little bit limited

1383
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:52,989
there we still need to work on the

1384
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:56,409
encrypting more but confirmation

1385
01:40:52,989 --> 01:40:59,980
messages from arduino as in okay or not

1386
01:40:56,409 --> 01:41:02,429
okay that goes flat so that it can't be

1387
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:02,428
discovered

1388
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:17,199
[Applause]

1389
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:35,510
CNP island or let's continue with IOT

1390
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:37,310
vigilant with their security bag let's

1391
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:40,060
continue with IOT vigilant with our

1392
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:40,060
security bank

1393
01:41:56,359 --> 01:42:08,800
sorry Esther damn B&S tablet

1394
01:42:16,789 --> 01:42:19,480
okay

1395
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:24,610
get out get out I wanna start this

1396
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:32,690
right let's get started let me tell you

1397
01:42:30,409 --> 01:42:37,339
that remind you that we all have secrets

1398
01:42:32,690 --> 01:42:41,230
right we all do for instance a happy API

1399
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:43,670
key a password a pin code access for

1400
01:42:41,230 --> 01:42:45,919
details for a credit card whatever

1401
01:42:43,670 --> 01:42:49,670
information we want to protect for

1402
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:52,039
whatever reason but starting today I can

1403
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:54,260
tell you that we are all going to have

1404
01:42:52,039 --> 01:42:56,599
secrets fine but we will all have

1405
01:42:54,260 --> 01:43:00,400
somewhere safe to keep them this is it

1406
01:42:56,599 --> 01:43:05,480
guarded box logo that has been generated

1407
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:08,179
from a random system that we found on

1408
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:10,848
the Internet so what is guarded box is

1409
01:43:08,179 --> 01:43:15,019
an online application with the server is

1410
01:43:10,849 --> 01:43:19,190
up on the cloud and so that we can store

1411
01:43:15,019 --> 01:43:24,710
our secrets and then access them

1412
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:29,169
anywhere anytime from any device and use

1413
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:34,369
them because secrets are going to be

1414
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:38,110
encrypted at the server encrypted at the

1415
01:43:34,369 --> 01:43:41,780
user's device and with a key that comes

1416
01:43:38,110 --> 01:43:44,659
directly from their passwords so secrets

1417
01:43:41,780 --> 01:43:47,389
will never use your device and at the

1418
01:43:44,659 --> 01:43:50,079
same time they will be protected we can

1419
01:43:47,389 --> 01:43:54,920
then share secrets with other users

1420
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:56,599
using an cryptographic system which is

1421
01:43:54,920 --> 01:44:03,079
useful if you ever want to send me your

1422
01:43:56,599 --> 01:44:04,789
bank card details and we think the main

1423
01:44:03,079 --> 01:44:07,989
feature here is that it's been

1424
01:44:04,789 --> 01:44:11,780
implemented following the most stringent

1425
01:44:07,989 --> 01:44:14,299
security practices and guidelines and

1426
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:19,039
with a mechanism to guarantee that

1427
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:22,550
passwords password and the P to encrypt

1428
01:44:19,039 --> 01:44:24,619
and decrypt our messages are is nowhere

1429
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:27,590
in particular just in your own head

1430
01:44:24,619 --> 01:44:29,960
which makes it a lot safer this is an

1431
01:44:27,590 --> 01:44:33,890
open source application

1432
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:36,860
on github so that you don't just need to

1433
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:40,100
trust me you can see how it does wash

1434
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:42,710
and all of this in a container so that

1435
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:45,920
any company can then download it and

1436
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:47,720
deploy it so you have all the

1437
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,550
instructions to deployed or if you don't

1438
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:51,500
feel like disappointed and deploying it

1439
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:53,690
and you just want to use it you have it

1440
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:56,290
on the cloud in the cloud and you can

1441
01:44:53,690 --> 01:45:00,080
use it anytime you want and free of cost

1442
01:44:56,290 --> 01:45:03,230
do doesn't go to card it rocks calm when

1443
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:06,250
I say it so a volunteer up here because

1444
01:45:03,230 --> 01:45:06,250
I need someone else

1445
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:26,849
so I don't know what it is

1446
01:45:33,849 --> 01:45:50,670
well I cannot fit it in their status and

1447
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:54,000
WLAN are mistakes in Berlin super okay

1448
01:45:50,670 --> 01:46:00,699
Monica not a smellinator do you know

1449
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:03,010
male in a tree it gives you males so

1450
01:46:00,699 --> 01:46:07,589
built one with the name whatever you

1451
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:07,590
choose just choose a name

1452
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:14,980
alright so the other top well maybe

1453
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:17,290
you've chosen and dressed with lots of

1454
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:21,239
crap because anyone can use it so you

1455
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:34,150
better use a different one because a

1456
01:46:21,239 --> 01:46:38,428
longer one so this is the other top here

1457
01:46:34,150 --> 01:46:38,429
police use your new email

1458
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:50,990
so a smellinator dot-com as if you'd

1459
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:57,559
wear your normal one mile inator

1460
01:46:50,990 --> 01:47:07,320
mailee nadir that come so I captured

1461
01:46:57,560 --> 01:47:12,930
this is the security one good girl

1462
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:14,400
please now it's not the time so it says

1463
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:18,600
you will get an email with instructions

1464
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:25,160
to sign up so you use yourself your

1465
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:25,160
email now I'm sorry about that

1466
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:45,589
you should get an email so click it and

1467
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:49,640
you have a token on the URL you can see

1468
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:52,520
that and let me just tell you okay use a

1469
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:56,660
password not not a usual one any other

1470
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:59,870
password it has to be longer there it

1471
01:47:56,660 --> 01:48:03,470
measures the length of the password so

1472
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:07,840
click on the eye down there that you can

1473
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:10,160
see there's a lengthen entropy measure

1474
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:12,290
if you to something like that you will

1475
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:16,930
not be able to you've registered to sign

1476
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:21,350
up it has to be a bit more solid robust

1477
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:24,340
so as you can see you need something

1478
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:30,200
that is longer twenty characters whoa

1479
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:36,560
twenty so okay here it so how to letter

1480
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:39,410
small letters you can copy it if you

1481
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:42,190
wish you can copy/paste it if you wish

1482
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:42,190
bit longer

1483
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:47,540
you

1484
01:48:52,260 --> 01:49:02,640
okay you can have that one copy it for

1485
01:48:55,990 --> 01:49:02,639
later and just fill it in anyway so

1486
01:49:04,590 --> 01:49:09,210
choose longer thins but

1487
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:15,370
you

1488
01:49:22,690 --> 01:49:31,849
all right so sign up now it's produced

1489
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:33,260
an ecliptic a fifty depends on the

1490
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:36,710
password and the other one depends on

1491
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:39,980
the question so you've your sign up now

1492
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:43,790
so click anywhere and you will go on to

1493
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:46,360
login and say remember yes or else you

1494
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:50,060
type it not difficult but yes in case

1495
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:52,160
okay get code because we have a second

1496
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:53,930
authentification factor that will be

1497
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:58,490
emailed to you right now same

1498
01:49:53,930 --> 01:50:04,160
cryptographic key as before so we'll be

1499
01:49:58,490 --> 01:50:06,610
using it so email next okay so if you

1500
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:06,610
have it

1501
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:28,969
all right so a secret anything you want

1502
01:50:31,189 --> 01:50:34,309
doesn't matter

1503
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:46,860
it'll measure the length and that's not

1504
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:50,460
compulsory do you just need to see

1505
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:53,790
whether the sicut erat in aids got the

1506
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:56,099
strength that is needed or not and

1507
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:59,519
that's your secret so if you press

1508
01:50:56,099 --> 01:51:03,929
reload you get it from the reload and

1509
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:07,409
you get it from the database so this is

1510
01:51:03,929 --> 01:51:14,130
coming from the database and this is

1511
01:51:07,409 --> 01:51:19,129
encrypted you need to press decrypt so

1512
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:21,750
there one under volume there you have it

1513
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:25,139
leave it there and you copy then on the

1514
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:28,469
right side that's my cell phone that's

1515
01:51:25,139 --> 01:51:32,179
my account so move the window away so

1516
01:51:28,469 --> 01:51:35,210
that it you can see so there you have it

1517
01:51:32,179 --> 01:51:40,679
on the right side you see my cell phone

1518
01:51:35,210 --> 01:51:44,010
these are my cigarettes and so I'll move

1519
01:51:40,679 --> 01:51:46,409
to the tickets here with me and there

1520
01:51:44,010 --> 01:51:48,000
you see roll wanted to share cross-site

1521
01:51:46,409 --> 01:51:52,799
scripting thank you very much for your

1522
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:56,000
audit by the way and share the secret

1523
01:51:52,800 --> 01:52:02,820
then you just produced with my account

1524
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:07,860
you have it there you can share and type

1525
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:10,340
by email which is Hong Hong tota

1526
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:14,860
Torres Garcia that's what it stands for

1527
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:25,389
89 at hotmail.com

1528
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:32,719
I got it here hello you've shared with

1529
01:52:25,389 --> 01:52:40,839
me that's a secret thank you very much

1530
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:51,669
[Applause]

1531
01:52:40,839 --> 01:52:55,459
I'll finish in a minute so what is the

1532
01:52:51,669 --> 01:52:57,769
development the deployment on on in the

1533
01:52:55,459 --> 01:53:01,459
cloud so this is an a cell for sealable

1534
01:52:57,769 --> 01:53:05,269
container I don't have much money so if

1535
01:53:01,459 --> 01:53:08,599
you add lots of things maybe it's easily

1536
01:53:05,269 --> 01:53:10,249
scalable but so far the free version is

1537
01:53:08,599 --> 01:53:12,829
more than enough what have we not done

1538
01:53:10,249 --> 01:53:16,249
the password recovery didn't have time

1539
01:53:12,829 --> 01:53:20,209
it has all been planned into database so

1540
01:53:16,249 --> 01:53:21,199
we have the responses to security

1541
01:53:20,209 --> 01:53:24,379
questions and everything else he's

1542
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:27,259
already but it could not have that and

1543
01:53:24,379 --> 01:53:30,649
what else has been done we had I crypt a

1544
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:33,379
challenge locking which adds a good deal

1545
01:53:30,649 --> 01:53:36,139
of security because they that never gets

1546
01:53:33,379 --> 01:53:38,479
the password and also the key word and

1547
01:53:36,139 --> 01:53:42,530
entropy expansion thank you very much

1548
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:53,649
and some future plans for the future and

1549
01:53:42,530 --> 01:53:53,648
thank you very much yota vigilant

1550
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:59,049
yeah continuation is security

1551
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:41,910
see

1552
01:55:25,229 --> 01:55:28,099
take me out light

1553
01:55:40,449 --> 01:55:45,619
para los equipos que quieran es

1554
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:48,560
conveniente cane open - la pantalla nest

1555
01:55:45,619 --> 01:55:51,769
indeed oh so please do not get the

1556
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:53,570
extended display because you will need

1557
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:56,540
to use the main screen and you will see

1558
01:55:53,570 --> 01:56:04,690
nothing used your laptop and we will use

1559
01:55:56,540 --> 01:56:04,690
all other screens we're ready

1560
01:56:08,840 --> 01:56:13,560
we are IOT vigilant and before we start

1561
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:15,690
let me think

1562
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:18,150
the organizing per minute for inviting

1563
01:56:15,690 --> 01:56:20,879
us with this idea that we came up with

1564
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:23,460
and thought was would be interesting and

1565
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:26,940
we had so much fun the Valentinian even

1566
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:33,770
though we're tired but as you can all

1567
01:56:26,940 --> 01:56:38,120
imagine IOT vigilant is a project we

1568
01:56:33,770 --> 01:56:40,110
conducted with the idea of modeling

1569
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:45,559
behaviors and devices with a low

1570
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:48,540
interaction such as IOT devices and

1571
01:56:45,560 --> 01:56:51,300
because of the massive increase for

1572
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:54,390
these devices and I think we're all

1573
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:59,610
aware of the dangers they entail we

1574
01:56:54,390 --> 01:57:03,390
would like to offer some kind of aid to

1575
01:56:59,610 --> 01:57:06,299
improve security of those devices so the

1576
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:11,430
idea would be to monitor those devices

1577
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:15,510
on the network on the internet see if

1578
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:18,710
there is any kind of weird behavior with

1579
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:21,420
the device that we're monitoring and

1580
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:23,190
there we would get an alert so the

1581
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:26,790
architecture with thought out for this

1582
01:57:23,190 --> 01:57:29,509
is several IOT devices on the same

1583
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:32,490
router this would be a Russ Berrie PI

1584
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:37,290
the Raspberry Pi is connected to the

1585
01:57:32,490 --> 01:57:39,929
Internet and then connected to a server

1586
01:57:37,290 --> 01:57:43,200
on which it sends met to it it sends

1587
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:45,420
metadata we thought were most

1588
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:51,679
interesting from all the packets capture

1589
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:51,680
from the IOT devices then this data

1590
01:57:51,959 --> 01:57:59,489
we keep them on an elastic search for

1591
01:57:56,789 --> 01:58:02,759
which we have an algorithm with behavior

1592
01:57:59,489 --> 01:58:06,360
modeling the idea is to find these weird

1593
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:10,019
behaviors to report the database the

1594
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:14,249
adductor stretch database and then show

1595
01:58:10,019 --> 01:58:17,070
a nice view to the user of how good or

1596
01:58:14,249 --> 01:58:23,340
bad the shape in what good or bad shape

1597
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:25,349
the network is we've thought there are

1598
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:28,979
several technologies that can be used to

1599
01:58:25,349 --> 01:58:32,369
capture metadata from the packages seen

1600
01:58:28,979 --> 01:58:35,639
by the router and so we decided to use

1601
01:58:32,369 --> 01:58:41,329
scalping so that any device that can run

1602
01:58:35,639 --> 01:58:46,260
Python can run our program our sniffing

1603
01:58:41,329 --> 01:58:51,630
and thanks to the years suggestion we

1604
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:53,909
decided to conduct a short rid of

1605
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:56,789
conflict that maybe is a bit more

1606
01:58:53,909 --> 01:59:02,009
widespread and it could help us if there

1607
01:58:56,789 --> 01:59:03,989
if we see that it is useful and helps

1608
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:07,019
that keep development developing in

1609
01:59:03,989 --> 01:59:09,598
which we would marry very much like this

1610
01:59:07,019 --> 01:59:14,360
is neighbors yes send data to the server

1611
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:17,729
and we see if there is any kind of weird

1612
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:19,589
behavior with the devices we've already

1613
01:59:17,729 --> 01:59:22,469
to discuss this information back to the

1614
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:25,920
server the local server can have an API

1615
01:59:22,469 --> 01:59:28,349
rest waiting on this gate as copy to get

1616
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:30,380
all the metadata from the packets

1617
01:59:28,349 --> 01:59:33,929
detected and then kept them on

1618
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:38,309
elasticsearch or maybe the server has a

1619
01:59:33,929 --> 01:59:40,229
net flow server waiting on them do you

1620
01:59:38,309 --> 01:59:42,179
invent them on elasticsearch it

1621
01:59:40,229 --> 01:59:44,489
indicates regardless of whether we're

1622
01:59:42,179 --> 01:59:47,189
using net flow or scabby for this

1623
01:59:44,489 --> 01:59:50,839
elastic search we always skip the same

1624
01:59:47,189 --> 01:59:50,840
data and the same structure

1625
01:59:54,160 --> 02:00:05,340
and normally detected thanks to the

1626
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:09,250
years help as well it uses a Gaussian

1627
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:13,570
algorithm and Victor will explain what

1628
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:20,970
that means and since I'm running out of

1629
02:00:13,570 --> 02:00:24,519
time let's start the demo so first demo

1630
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:28,930
we have several docker files to show you

1631
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:32,110
first the infrastructures using Scapa

1632
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:34,810
and NetFlow with a dia of scene that

1633
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:37,839
they do work and then we'll have a bit

1634
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:44,770
more exposed a mo where we'll say the

1635
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:46,980
full their behavior of the system so

1636
02:00:44,770 --> 02:00:46,980
here

1637
02:00:48,139 --> 02:00:55,400
we get the Raspberry Pi to send packets

1638
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:57,710
in NetFlow format to my server and the

1639
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:59,929
Raspberry Pi will get all the packets

1640
02:00:57,710 --> 02:01:02,449
from all the devices connected and will

1641
02:00:59,929 --> 02:01:08,239
send the net flow form of packets to my

1642
02:01:02,449 --> 02:01:14,178
server on my server which is a docker

1643
02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:21,400
compose that we will get life using just

1644
02:01:14,179 --> 02:01:25,730
this so we will use a graph panel these

1645
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:28,699
the server for the net flow data that

1646
02:01:25,730 --> 02:01:31,580
will then will be saved in elasticsearch

1647
02:01:28,699 --> 02:01:36,589
we don't have time but believe me it

1648
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:42,380
does what I do it does and all three

1649
02:01:36,590 --> 02:01:48,080
containers are on and then next on to

1650
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:51,580
the next test same test assess the same

1651
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:53,929
we will use graph Anna Griffin

1652
02:01:51,580 --> 02:01:57,559
elasticsearch and the host waiting for

1653
02:01:53,929 --> 02:02:00,530
the data but here as inside the RasPi

1654
02:01:57,560 --> 02:02:02,710
will be running scaping for that to

1655
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:02,710
happen

1656
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:19,870
so we need to go to the russ berrie and

1657
02:02:16,690 --> 02:02:23,019
run the sniffer with the IP the port how

1658
02:02:19,870 --> 02:02:27,450
often the interface is not in its to

1659
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:29,950
check and we can also have Mac filtering

1660
02:02:27,450 --> 02:02:32,410
so that we can decide what we are

1661
02:02:29,950 --> 02:02:34,750
interested in looking and what we are

1662
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:38,920
not so interested in looking into and

1663
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:43,630
inside the server remain machine just to

1664
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:47,620
go live let's use a compose again quite

1665
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:50,290
fast by the way and here we have an

1666
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:55,300
elasticsearch grave funnel and a web

1667
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:57,670
server that allows to you acquire all

1668
02:02:55,300 --> 02:03:01,540
those data from Scotty and keep them on

1669
02:02:57,670 --> 02:03:03,640
elasticsearch so you could see how we

1670
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:05,830
are saving this insight but we are

1671
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:07,720
actually short of time and we still need

1672
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:14,610
to discuss what's most interesting here

1673
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:14,610
so great and finally

1674
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:24,540
let's discuss a fall full deployment

1675
02:03:20,090 --> 02:03:27,210
which does work by the way and for that

1676
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:34,350
all we have to do is in sight the rest

1677
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:37,710
Barry we ran the same commanders before

1678
02:03:34,350 --> 02:03:41,850
but here we've added certain protocol

1679
02:03:37,710 --> 02:03:45,830
HTTP 5 so that it's locked

1680
02:03:41,850 --> 02:03:48,900
using HTTPS we've used a self-signed

1681
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:51,840
certificate because for our demo we

1682
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:53,849
would not do anything more professional

1683
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:56,190
than that but we wanted to show that we

1684
02:03:53,850 --> 02:04:01,740
can do this the safest way please

1685
02:03:56,190 --> 02:04:06,089
encrypt in traffic so I have it here and

1686
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:09,389
you can see every number indicates they

1687
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:11,970
metadata from a packet capture is sent

1688
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:14,400
to the server that will look into it and

1689
02:04:11,970 --> 02:04:18,330
it will see if there's any kind of

1690
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:23,309
anomaly for which we send we changed the

1691
02:04:18,330 --> 02:04:29,400
connection and meanwhile we explained

1692
02:04:23,310 --> 02:04:32,580
the algorithm we used model it the

1693
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:34,650
starting idea was to use an anomaly

1694
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:38,400
detection algorithm that would be based

1695
02:04:34,650 --> 02:04:42,089
in intensity but as discussed with the

1696
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:45,019
euros because of memory years we were

1697
02:04:42,090 --> 02:04:53,040
recommended he years got him mix

1698
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:55,980
algorithm we decided to change and so

1699
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:58,500
that you understand what we've done in

1700
02:04:55,980 --> 02:05:03,299
order to choose the number of course in

1701
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:05,910
components with swept wanted 10

1702
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:10,350
components with scant 1 to 10 components

1703
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:13,760
and then with minimized it and this is

1704
02:05:10,350 --> 02:05:13,760
the number of components were given

1705
02:05:14,570 --> 02:05:21,950
let's see if it connects we with some

1706
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:34,269
we've tried with a small setup with a

1707
02:05:31,390 --> 02:05:46,540
limited setup we found changes in the

1708
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:48,699
behavior this is great phenom and this

1709
02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:52,690
is a short dashboard where you see up

1710
02:05:48,699 --> 02:05:56,589
there the traffic that we get from the

1711
02:05:52,690 --> 02:05:59,469
sniffing and what it's not too

1712
02:05:56,590 --> 02:06:02,830
complicated but down there what's that's

1713
02:05:59,469 --> 02:06:07,719
what's interesting that's the behavior

1714
02:06:02,830 --> 02:06:10,690
of our network what we're measuring here

1715
02:06:07,719 --> 02:06:18,550
is how weird the data we get from the

1716
02:06:10,690 --> 02:06:23,769
network are using the DMM model and

1717
02:06:18,550 --> 02:06:28,030
there you see for example for a value

1718
02:06:23,770 --> 02:06:30,550
that is 0 here this would be the regular

1719
02:06:28,030 --> 02:06:35,650
behavior and with an increase like this

1720
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:39,790
this percentage how much is it these are

1721
02:06:35,650 --> 02:06:43,089
30 percent right we thought that from 30

1722
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:47,530
percent a change in behavior we will

1723
02:06:43,090 --> 02:06:50,380
start an alert and this kind of data we

1724
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:52,900
got them through the presentations for

1725
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:55,150
which we had the lab and we've managed

1726
02:06:52,900 --> 02:07:00,659
to produce this change this detection

1727
02:06:55,150 --> 02:07:04,900
and by downloading Netflix films and

1728
02:07:00,659 --> 02:07:10,230
nothing or doing that or just scanning

1729
02:07:04,900 --> 02:07:10,230
with nmap on the network and that's all

1730
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,809
I security and cyber watcher

1731
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:31,090
of course it's not working as a with any

1732
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:42,240
demo this is off so let's leave our

1733
02:08:31,090 --> 02:08:42,240
friend little frontier does it work

1734
02:09:02,030 --> 02:09:30,450
doesn't matter so we still beat out of

1735
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:34,530
the room so okay so we are intelligence

1736
02:09:30,450 --> 02:09:37,380
security and we had the monitoring and

1737
02:09:34,530 --> 02:09:39,420
management of security for SMEs so this

1738
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:42,030
is a service because that's what it is

1739
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:44,700
with lots of technologies we were very

1740
02:09:42,030 --> 02:09:47,370
ambitious I guess we are the most

1741
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:50,910
ambitious team ever since the avengers'

1742
02:09:47,370 --> 02:09:55,170
and trying to provide security for

1743
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:57,570
people who don't have it so ever since

1744
02:09:55,170 --> 02:10:00,480
Avengers we are more tearing the given

1745
02:09:57,570 --> 02:10:02,429
security people who own a business but

1746
02:10:00,480 --> 02:10:05,190
are vulnerable and don't have the

1747
02:10:02,430 --> 02:10:09,780
resources or the knowledge to face that

1748
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:12,330
and first thing I wanted to say is these

1749
02:10:09,780 --> 02:10:16,019
have been too heavy days at cyber camp

1750
02:10:12,330 --> 02:10:18,510
we've sweat blasts we had fun we've met

1751
02:10:16,020 --> 02:10:30,900
interesting people and we've seen so

1752
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:31,680
many interesting projects so we were

1753
02:10:30,900 --> 02:10:33,860
three people

1754
02:10:31,680 --> 02:10:38,340
and after the hackathon it's two of us

1755
02:10:33,860 --> 02:10:43,940
but but we had someone who deflected

1756
02:10:38,340 --> 02:10:43,940
last minute and there's a new team that

1757
02:10:45,680 --> 02:10:51,470
we want you to meet and let's go and see

1758
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:51,469
if we can hear me

1759
02:10:53,270 --> 02:11:00,660
so Google Toxie security agent okay this

1760
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:03,620
is the latest version of security agent

1761
02:11:00,660 --> 02:11:09,420
good morning

1762
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:12,780
something you are I'm a virtual

1763
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:15,710
assistant that using lateral language to

1764
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:19,559
report on the security of your company I

1765
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:22,470
can detect several threats thanks to

1766
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:25,050
other components that I set up in your

1767
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:29,300
infrastructure even the right now I'm

1768
02:11:25,050 --> 02:11:32,100
not very intelligent and ready to

1769
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:34,770
incorporate new attack detection

1770
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:37,170
techniques and learn faster better than

1771
02:11:34,770 --> 02:11:49,170
my former colleagues that for sure javi

1772
02:11:37,170 --> 02:11:49,800
she's all done you here we have it as

1773
02:11:49,170 --> 02:11:53,750
well

1774
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:53,750
we have many reports

1775
02:11:56,230 --> 02:12:09,500
okay this one is going on so this is a

1776
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:11,590
demo well this is state of the art we

1777
02:12:09,500 --> 02:12:14,930
wanted to discuss child at the

1778
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:17,420
challenges achieved or the landmarks

1779
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:19,010
achieved it's been C days we were

1780
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:20,710
studying from scratch we learned about

1781
02:12:19,010 --> 02:12:22,790
new technologies we've been touching

1782
02:12:20,710 --> 02:12:25,130
modules here and there and so many

1783
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:28,010
repositories and only three people and

1784
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:29,890
in the end we wanted to divide it into

1785
02:12:28,010 --> 02:12:32,870
three parts which is the application

1786
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:35,630
that the fraud and the virtual assistant

1787
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:38,690
and then the backend so how do you read

1788
02:12:35,630 --> 02:12:42,980
all an app for the move I'll add more or

1789
02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:46,790
less we got something that is decent

1790
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:50,929
enough we have an app we will discuss it

1791
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:57,200
later on but here you have it not

1792
02:12:50,930 --> 02:13:00,239
working oh here it is on the Internet

1793
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:00,239
[Music]

1794
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:06,920
so we've reached it all almost

1795
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:10,340
everything you see the alert and devices

1796
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:17,240
and users and even alerts from alerts

1797
02:13:10,340 --> 02:13:20,540
from the users then we also had the

1798
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:25,040
version virtual assistant that we

1799
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:26,870
present it now we've managed for the

1800
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:29,120
assistant to be able to answer what a

1801
02:13:26,870 --> 02:13:33,830
lot of questions provide quite a lot of

1802
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:37,550
details and also it's quite interesting

1803
02:13:33,830 --> 02:13:40,100
that if somebody knows nothing about

1804
02:13:37,550 --> 02:13:41,480
security like my parents for instance

1805
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:44,000
they've got me they think I know

1806
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:46,790
something so they have a doubt they can

1807
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:55,370
ask me well people could ask the

1808
02:13:46,790 --> 02:13:59,110
assistant I've been working with javi

1809
02:13:55,370 --> 02:14:02,300
on the back at the back end mostly

1810
02:13:59,110 --> 02:14:05,179
working with different technologies

1811
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:07,880
because happy we've covered most of the

1812
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:08,760
components and we set out ourselves to

1813
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:11,940
do

1814
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:14,280
an infrastructure with different pieces

1815
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:16,769
of equipment communicating with a

1816
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:20,070
central server at the beginning we were

1817
02:14:16,770 --> 02:14:24,290
thinking of using spark we then decided

1818
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:25,889
to use elastic search at the hillside

1819
02:14:24,290 --> 02:14:30,900
and so on

1820
02:14:25,890 --> 02:14:34,410
and a server on frosh I'm working with

1821
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:37,950
elastic search and so that Lukas our

1822
02:14:34,410 --> 02:14:41,790
colleague could then pick pick up on

1823
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:45,239
that for mobile details so we've covered

1824
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:46,830
that as well or most of that we also

1825
02:14:45,239 --> 02:14:49,259
proposed a number of different

1826
02:14:46,830 --> 02:14:50,010
capacities that we can see up on the

1827
02:14:49,260 --> 02:14:55,890
screen now

1828
02:14:50,010 --> 02:15:00,330
for instance alerts and logs have been

1829
02:14:55,890 --> 02:15:04,290
covered we've also called a qivana to be

1830
02:15:00,330 --> 02:15:08,040
able to visualize real-time reporting

1831
02:15:04,290 --> 02:15:11,790
and then threat threat hunting and

1832
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:14,430
security intelligence for threat

1833
02:15:11,790 --> 02:15:17,610
detection we haven't done so much of

1834
02:15:14,430 --> 02:15:19,830
that we've covered some modules we've

1835
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:22,290
got the infrastructure for more modules

1836
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:25,170
to be included but we didn't have time

1837
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:28,320
to cover all of that why because we

1838
02:15:25,170 --> 02:15:31,680
forgot offer about a basic capacity that

1839
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:34,790
is the infrastructure we thought are

1840
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:37,140
we'll just set it all up on

1841
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:38,910
elasticsearch and Amazon and that will

1842
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:42,210
only take a couple of minutes well it

1843
02:15:38,910 --> 02:15:45,800
didn't we were wrong there so I think we

1844
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:45,800
can run the demo No

1845
02:15:47,770 --> 02:15:57,270
and I'm first going to show you here the

1846
02:15:52,840 --> 02:16:01,080
central server including elasticsearch

1847
02:15:57,270 --> 02:16:05,200
this is where our detection system is

1848
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:10,420
running it's like a small driver with

1849
02:16:05,200 --> 02:16:15,190
different plugins to detect a number of

1850
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:16,630
things there will be a config file so

1851
02:16:15,190 --> 02:16:19,629
that this is more a little bit more

1852
02:16:16,630 --> 02:16:22,980
simple so that collecting information

1853
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:26,440
from the servers and alerts will be

1854
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:28,839
generated that will be stored on elastic

1855
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:32,949
search and then sent to the smart

1856
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:35,620
assistant on the mobile phone so let me

1857
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:39,240
just show you some more or less real

1858
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:39,240
examples now on the demo

1859
02:16:50,010 --> 02:16:57,389
for the detection service to work it

1860
02:16:54,058 --> 02:17:01,500
just needs to be hidden and then we can

1861
02:16:57,388 --> 02:17:04,199
modify the config file which is not what

1862
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:08,010
we're going to do now anyway

1863
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:12,210
let's run that you see that initial

1864
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:14,790
modules are working one for detecting

1865
02:17:12,209 --> 02:17:17,598
different injections on web applications

1866
02:17:14,790 --> 02:17:20,279
for instance as a very simple module

1867
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:23,148
covering the whole range depending on

1868
02:17:20,279 --> 02:17:26,160
the data well

1869
02:17:23,148 --> 02:17:29,849
scripting file Traverse or that type of

1870
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:35,269
thing running for the time that you

1871
02:17:29,849 --> 02:17:42,109
specify on the config file we have

1872
02:17:35,269 --> 02:17:45,000
prepared a web application with a

1873
02:17:42,109 --> 02:17:49,800
cross-site scripting is called

1874
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:52,978
multi-lane this is a fire pit and SQL

1875
02:17:49,799 --> 02:17:55,468
and that sends details to elasticsearch

1876
02:17:52,978 --> 02:17:58,468
and then the program I showed you

1877
02:17:55,468 --> 02:18:06,379
earlier will work with that so that the

1878
02:17:58,468 --> 02:18:06,379
alert can show it's quite simple

1879
02:18:22,150 --> 02:18:27,388
properly their letter size is too small

1880
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:37,690
so the service is now monitoring

1881
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:41,440
everything parsing the logs and the

1882
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:45,429
information on elasticsearch so look at

1883
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:49,030
that let me stop it right now

1884
02:18:45,429 --> 02:18:52,120
is detected there has been a call on a

1885
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:55,179
new a URL so it gets the parameters

1886
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:58,719
getting the contents of each parameter

1887
02:18:55,179 --> 02:19:05,530
and then it starts comparing up against

1888
02:18:58,718 --> 02:19:09,099
a set of data there are metrics that

1889
02:19:05,530 --> 02:19:11,500
allows it to see similarities and

1890
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:13,300
differences between them and then it

1891
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:15,549
gives you the likelihood of it

1892
02:19:13,299 --> 02:19:18,629
correspondent corresponding to the

1893
02:19:15,549 --> 02:19:22,570
cross-site scripting and there was the

1894
02:19:18,629 --> 02:19:26,730
notification alert did you see that it

1895
02:19:22,570 --> 02:19:31,080
says hi there has been a new alert

1896
02:19:26,730 --> 02:19:36,520
coming to the system this is the

1897
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:39,280
injection detector poor javi has been

1898
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:44,590
suffering all the tests on his mobile

1899
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:48,280
phone and in that case it would be

1900
02:19:44,590 --> 02:19:51,280
associated to the user who might have

1901
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:54,250
been the source of that threat there's

1902
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:56,561
also a dashboard that talks about the

1903
02:19:54,250 --> 02:20:00,220
general status and then general

1904
02:19:56,561 --> 02:20:04,449
information for people to read and check

1905
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:07,811
up on google l can I talk to my security

1906
02:20:04,450 --> 02:20:11,010
assistant sorry I don't know how I can

1907
02:20:07,811 --> 02:20:11,010
help you I'm still learning

1908
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:20,340
okay Google please tell me what do you

1909
02:20:17,530 --> 02:20:20,340
want me to talk about

1910
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:26,690
I want to talk to the security agent

1911
02:20:24,590 --> 02:20:33,260
sorry I can't help you talk to the

1912
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:36,170
security agent Google ok then I'm going

1913
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:41,061
to find the last version of the security

1914
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:44,240
agent tell me the status of the

1915
02:20:41,061 --> 02:20:47,180
company's security and the injection

1916
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:51,170
code attack has been attacked detected

1917
02:20:47,180 --> 02:20:54,830
what is and what is that a code

1918
02:20:51,170 --> 02:20:57,590
injection means an attacker might be

1919
02:20:54,830 --> 02:21:02,240
trying to compromise your company's

1920
02:20:57,590 --> 02:21:06,070
security including unexpected values in

1921
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:07,930
some of your web applications you see

1922
02:21:06,070 --> 02:21:11,029
that's how it works

1923
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:11,030
[Applause]

1924
02:21:21,430 --> 02:21:34,641
cyber watcher the next team and the

1925
02:21:31,311 --> 02:21:39,070
following team just get ready because

1926
02:21:34,641 --> 02:21:39,070
you'll be coming next is cyber Spartans

1927
02:22:42,470 --> 02:22:47,130
we know when I started this I that good

1928
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:49,609
afternoon

1929
02:22:47,130 --> 02:22:52,910
there seems to be a slight technical

1930
02:22:49,610 --> 02:22:56,490
hiccup let's hope we can overcome it

1931
02:22:52,910 --> 02:22:59,939
we asked the cyber cyber watchers that

1932
02:22:56,490 --> 02:23:03,930
the name of our team Santi Javier and

1933
02:22:59,939 --> 02:23:05,939
myself three of us so as soon as it's

1934
02:23:03,930 --> 02:23:08,600
all ready we will continue with our

1935
02:23:05,939 --> 02:23:08,600
presentation

1936
02:23:37,420 --> 02:23:48,279
I see market I would be very sorry my

1937
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:51,489
laptop seems to have crashed it was

1938
02:23:48,279 --> 02:23:54,420
already but it was but I probably waited

1939
02:23:51,489 --> 02:23:54,420
too long with his own

1940
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:06,851
yeah just better title

1941
02:24:07,381 --> 02:24:14,631
I can go confidently simply

1942
02:24:32,110 --> 02:24:44,980
hello he's no other screams working only

1943
02:24:39,700 --> 02:24:48,240
the smaller ones I can't send anything

1944
02:24:44,980 --> 02:24:48,240
on my laptop

1945
02:24:52,871 --> 02:24:57,760
okay we can all see now what we're doing

1946
02:24:55,480 --> 02:25:00,421
not something apologies and thank you

1947
02:24:57,761 --> 02:25:00,421
for your patience

1948
02:25:20,670 --> 02:25:25,020
Molly ela presenter first align

1949
02:25:34,790 --> 02:25:40,580
when is it good now he's finally working

1950
02:25:43,910 --> 02:25:49,250
that's right I corrected it yeah I've

1951
02:25:46,710 --> 02:25:53,339
done it thank you

1952
02:25:49,250 --> 02:25:54,979
so as Miguel Anka said our name is cyber

1953
02:25:53,340 --> 02:25:59,670
butchers

1954
02:25:54,979 --> 02:26:04,949
we wanted to design a platform that we

1955
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:10,050
are calling as soap so that users cannot

1956
02:26:04,950 --> 02:26:13,439
be identified for logging purposes or

1957
02:26:10,050 --> 02:26:16,560
identification purposes on websites so

1958
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:20,760
that there can be a centralized platform

1959
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:25,550
and we can use it when logging in or

1960
02:26:20,760 --> 02:26:25,550
having to identify themselves as users

1961
02:26:28,939 --> 02:26:45,350
so double factor identification so we

1962
02:26:39,689 --> 02:26:48,750
couldn't make the USB to work properly

1963
02:26:45,350 --> 02:26:52,370
we had a library that supposedly would

1964
02:26:48,750 --> 02:26:56,720
do that for us but our browsers couldn't

1965
02:26:52,370 --> 02:27:00,930
identify the fingerprint identification

1966
02:26:56,720 --> 02:27:03,949
for some reason so what did we do use

1967
02:27:00,930 --> 02:27:07,580
the user credentials username and

1968
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:11,070
password and then as extra security

1969
02:27:07,580 --> 02:27:16,620
sending a PIN number to users so that

1970
02:27:11,070 --> 02:27:20,310
they first register then web sites that

1971
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:22,260
want to use our platform for users to

1972
02:27:20,310 --> 02:27:24,359
authenticate would need to register with

1973
02:27:22,260 --> 02:27:30,630
us as well and then that would all be

1974
02:27:24,360 --> 02:27:33,030
matched so for IT management we used the

1975
02:27:30,630 --> 02:27:35,948
ID standard which we think is the most

1976
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:39,729
mature technology at the moment

1977
02:27:35,949 --> 02:27:43,149
what have we been doing here well mostly

1978
02:27:39,729 --> 02:27:46,489
learning how to use the fingerprint

1979
02:27:43,149 --> 02:27:50,000
detector as my colleague said but

1980
02:27:46,489 --> 02:27:53,750
unfortunately the internet doesn't seem

1981
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,069
to know that we have iru 4000 so that's

1982
02:27:53,750 --> 02:28:00,079
why we couldn't use it

1983
02:27:55,069 --> 02:28:03,739
the authentication service finally will

1984
02:28:00,079 --> 02:28:06,949
work with an SMS with the additional

1985
02:28:03,739 --> 02:28:10,850
security given by the pin number and

1986
02:28:06,949 --> 02:28:14,600
then we had the idea that the cyber camp

1987
02:28:10,850 --> 02:28:17,529
teams could take a vote on how they

1988
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:22,779
think this authentication might work

1989
02:28:17,529 --> 02:28:25,939
because our platform would get up users

1990
02:28:22,779 --> 02:28:28,159
registering just once giving their

1991
02:28:25,939 --> 02:28:31,220
details and whatever we think is

1992
02:28:28,159 --> 02:28:34,960
necessary and then the platform through

1993
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:41,060
open ID would give websites a

1994
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:43,669
information in some cases maybe the

1995
02:28:41,060 --> 02:28:47,930
email address is wrong but otherwise

1996
02:28:43,670 --> 02:28:51,260
very basic information and the voting

1997
02:28:47,930 --> 02:28:54,739
application the idea is that user would

1998
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:57,290
log in you would have their email

1999
02:28:54,739 --> 02:29:00,890
address just to make sure that people

2000
02:28:57,290 --> 02:29:03,409
that you know people have voted or they

2001
02:29:00,890 --> 02:29:06,439
don't vote twice or that they don't vote

2002
02:29:03,409 --> 02:29:09,979
on behalf of somebody else as I said

2003
02:29:06,439 --> 02:29:12,890
because the pin code will be sent by SMS

2004
02:29:09,979 --> 02:29:14,899
that will be added security I think

2005
02:29:12,890 --> 02:29:20,448
we're going to see this better here on

2006
02:29:14,899 --> 02:29:24,528
this diagram this is a flow diagram call

2007
02:29:20,449 --> 02:29:28,369
it what you will you can see there the

2008
02:29:24,529 --> 02:29:33,350
three stakeholders users with their PC

2009
02:29:28,369 --> 02:29:36,649
the soap s SOP platform that's us and

2010
02:29:33,350 --> 02:29:41,210
then the voting platform that would be

2011
02:29:36,649 --> 02:29:43,608
the third party system so the cyber camp

2012
02:29:41,210 --> 02:29:48,019
website in this case I would have to

2013
02:29:43,609 --> 02:29:49,310
register as client with us as the SSL P

2014
02:29:48,020 --> 02:29:51,979
platform you

2015
02:29:49,310 --> 02:29:55,840
would also have to register with us at

2016
02:29:51,979 --> 02:30:01,399
the platform and then when users start

2017
02:29:55,840 --> 02:30:06,500
their session then the cyber cyber

2018
02:30:01,399 --> 02:30:10,039
voting website sends the logging to our

2019
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:14,199
platform and if the user name and part

2020
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:19,609
and password are correct we will send

2021
02:30:14,199 --> 02:30:23,300
this the text message with the ping code

2022
02:30:19,609 --> 02:30:24,260
and that's when the platform could say

2023
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:26,989
right

2024
02:30:24,260 --> 02:30:29,449
authentication is correct and let it

2025
02:30:26,989 --> 02:30:33,260
through or we've also studied situations

2026
02:30:29,449 --> 02:30:35,869
where when the website could even keep

2027
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:38,989
as I said earlier the users email

2028
02:30:35,869 --> 02:30:44,449
address and use that as added security

2029
02:30:38,989 --> 02:30:47,060
and control we didn't have time for the

2030
02:30:44,449 --> 02:30:51,560
registration well with Jango we did

2031
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:57,470
cover a little bit of that we have got

2032
02:30:51,560 --> 02:31:02,649
as far as the token point there so that

2033
02:30:57,470 --> 02:31:05,239
access could not be doubled or repeated

2034
02:31:02,649 --> 02:31:08,899
so what would happen next well the user

2035
02:31:05,239 --> 02:31:12,350
would fault shall I run the demo next

2036
02:31:08,899 --> 02:31:17,829
but just a couple of comments one of the

2037
02:31:12,350 --> 02:31:22,540
advantages that the SLP platform offers

2038
02:31:17,829 --> 02:31:26,119
the real innovations are was well

2039
02:31:22,540 --> 02:31:29,000
avoiding data redundancy you don't need

2040
02:31:26,119 --> 02:31:30,979
to have credentials stored at different

2041
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:33,949
data bases we think that's really

2042
02:31:30,979 --> 02:31:36,769
positive the disadvantage is that they

2043
02:31:33,949 --> 02:31:37,399
sent the system is centralized so if it

2044
02:31:36,770 --> 02:31:41,569
crashes

2045
02:31:37,399 --> 02:31:47,180
everything goes or is halted that's why

2046
02:31:41,569 --> 02:31:50,750
security has to be super tops for

2047
02:31:47,180 --> 02:31:56,210
storage to really really not be

2048
02:31:50,750 --> 02:31:59,580
vulnerable what else originally we

2049
02:31:56,210 --> 02:32:02,880
wanted to implement biometrics as

2050
02:31:59,580 --> 02:32:06,300
an added element with thoughts and

2051
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:08,880
thoughts and finally came up with other

2052
02:32:06,300 --> 02:32:14,130
possibilities for future improvements

2053
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:16,619
for instance parental control apart from

2054
02:32:14,130 --> 02:32:18,300
your mobile phone number you could have

2055
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:22,790
somebody else's phone number for

2056
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:22,789
instance in the case of minors or

2057
02:32:23,660 --> 02:32:35,910
youngsters with for instance a betting

2058
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:39,271
addiction or gaming addiction well there

2059
02:32:35,910 --> 02:32:44,280
might be some limitations for certain

2060
02:32:39,271 --> 02:32:48,360
individuals that to be defined so this

2061
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:53,820
is our standard bootstrap template here

2062
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:56,610
we have the teams to be voted and this

2063
02:32:53,820 --> 02:33:01,440
is their sights on a thousand and one

2064
02:32:56,610 --> 02:33:07,320
just as an example website this is the

2065
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:14,400
admin button to access jungle itself so

2066
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:22,619
when starting your session Open ID means

2067
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:24,449
that the website 8000 would come on and

2068
02:33:22,620 --> 02:33:27,240
this is where we validate with our

2069
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:30,170
username and password that means the

2070
02:33:27,240 --> 02:33:34,170
user would know that the cyber voting

2071
02:33:30,170 --> 02:33:37,740
application is going to ask for his or

2072
02:33:34,170 --> 02:33:41,100
her ID must be because of a token right

2073
02:33:37,740 --> 02:33:43,530
let's accept us then the second token

2074
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:47,320
and apologies for the design because

2075
02:33:43,530 --> 02:33:50,021
it's not very pretty so

2076
02:33:47,320 --> 02:33:53,020
my colleagues mobile phone has been sent

2077
02:33:50,021 --> 02:33:57,850
the pink coat that's right I've got it

2078
02:33:53,021 --> 02:34:00,400
here all I have to do now is it okay let

2079
02:33:57,850 --> 02:34:03,490
me tell you six six seven one seven five

2080
02:34:00,400 --> 02:34:11,320
that's the code sorry six seven one

2081
02:34:03,490 --> 02:34:13,271
seven five double six sorry Wow let's

2082
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:16,150
take advantage of this I'm going to

2083
02:34:13,271 --> 02:34:22,450
enter it wrong I'm going to get it wrong

2084
02:34:16,150 --> 02:34:25,660
and that's with a random keypad by the

2085
02:34:22,450 --> 02:34:27,910
way next one one four eight three one

2086
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:37,000
four now the next one I was sent just

2087
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:43,390
now so that one's correct I entered it

2088
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:44,350
correctly this time something went wrong

2089
02:34:43,390 --> 02:34:47,380
what was it

2090
02:34:44,350 --> 02:34:49,690
I lost my token because I entered it

2091
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:55,000
wrong first time round or I took too

2092
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:57,900
long must have been something let us let

2093
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:05,190
me just try and do it again just quickly

2094
02:34:57,900 --> 02:35:05,190
sometimes the token seems to go missing

2095
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:16,320
can you give me the new number four five

2096
02:35:08,700 --> 02:35:19,320
top of five sorry four five double 5 9 6

2097
02:35:16,320 --> 02:35:19,320
right

2098
02:35:20,470 --> 02:35:28,688
you see there's the token we had huge

2099
02:35:25,750 --> 02:35:33,850
problems with integrating with open ID

2100
02:35:28,689 --> 02:35:36,479
use USB all sorts believe me but I know

2101
02:35:33,850 --> 02:35:42,069
we now have the token and the voting

2102
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:46,510
website could then register access the

2103
02:35:42,069 --> 02:35:49,359
vote and then see as our session oh

2104
02:35:46,510 --> 02:35:52,870
sorry the closing session button doesn't

2105
02:35:49,359 --> 02:35:55,479
exist yet we have no time to do that

2106
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:59,640
what would we like to do in the future

2107
02:35:55,479 --> 02:36:02,679
well adding biometrics fingerprint

2108
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:06,340
authentication for instance improving

2109
02:36:02,680 --> 02:36:10,330
also the registration process for users

2110
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:14,920
and websites reinforcing the security at

2111
02:36:10,330 --> 02:36:18,130
the SSO P server and also use

2112
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:19,270
registration of identity for users we

2113
02:36:18,130 --> 02:36:30,580
would like to improve that thank you

2114
02:36:19,270 --> 02:36:32,500
very much for your attention and last

2115
02:36:30,580 --> 02:36:36,120
but not least we will now be hearing

2116
02:36:32,500 --> 02:36:36,120
from the last team Spartans

2117
02:37:29,940 --> 02:37:35,779
what

2118
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:39,439
well nosotros somos Yanni Spartans live

2119
02:37:35,779 --> 02:37:45,249
I mean that so our team cyber Spartans a

2120
02:37:39,439 --> 02:37:48,279
wanted to design water to prevent and

2121
02:37:45,249 --> 02:37:53,208
protect against the times attacks

2122
02:37:48,279 --> 02:37:57,050
through a point or scoring system this

2123
02:37:53,209 --> 02:37:59,180
is the infrastructure on docker stirring

2124
02:37:57,050 --> 02:38:00,829
the logs coming from the machines the

2125
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:04,399
container with Python and the

2126
02:38:00,829 --> 02:38:07,189
application and then this area here to

2127
02:38:04,399 --> 02:38:10,430
save the tables the auxiliary or

2128
02:38:07,189 --> 02:38:13,459
ancillary tables let me run it because

2129
02:38:10,430 --> 02:38:17,270
at the moment is still a little bit slow

2130
02:38:13,459 --> 02:38:22,579
and in the meantime as the docker

2131
02:38:17,270 --> 02:38:25,399
compost M is working let me just remind

2132
02:38:22,579 --> 02:38:27,439
you that one of those is going to work

2133
02:38:25,399 --> 02:38:31,868
as in it attack Ram if the other two

2134
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:36,319
will be sending info to elasticsearch

2135
02:38:31,869 --> 02:38:38,359
the demo is too long and because it's

2136
02:38:36,319 --> 02:38:45,909
playing in the background I will have to

2137
02:38:38,359 --> 02:38:49,939
skip some pieces this is the v1 machine

2138
02:38:45,909 --> 02:38:53,239
sending requests and a having access on

2139
02:38:49,939 --> 02:38:57,649
the other two virtual machines later all

2140
02:38:53,239 --> 02:38:58,069
from v1 we will see that v2 works with

2141
02:38:57,649 --> 02:39:03,829
you

2142
02:38:58,069 --> 02:39:06,109
RP tables you can see there are no

2143
02:39:03,829 --> 02:39:08,720
written rules at the moment that means

2144
02:39:06,109 --> 02:39:10,339
we can still have access and in the

2145
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:14,390
meantime the rest of the infrastructure

2146
02:39:10,339 --> 02:39:19,539
is getting ready to run so elastic is

2147
02:39:14,390 --> 02:39:19,538
going to pick up on all the elements

2148
02:39:21,061 --> 02:39:26,820
and this is what we need for the

2149
02:39:24,001 --> 02:39:30,051
application to use later this is the

2150
02:39:26,820 --> 02:39:32,931
window with the indices at the top

2151
02:39:30,051 --> 02:39:36,301
coming from the two virtual machines

2152
02:39:32,931 --> 02:39:39,120
with the file bits at the bottom we have

2153
02:39:36,301 --> 02:39:43,381
the containers running for the

2154
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:50,251
infrastructure to be maintained as logs

2155
02:39:43,381 --> 02:39:54,869
are sent you see that at the top it says

2156
02:39:50,251 --> 02:40:00,240
that 4364 documents have been covered

2157
02:39:54,870 --> 02:40:04,530
and now the Mongo table here just to

2158
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:08,881
show you how the scores are stored at

2159
02:40:04,530 --> 02:40:15,360
the moment is at fifteen and no actions

2160
02:40:08,881 --> 02:40:18,449
will start until it goes over 100 so

2161
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:21,230
what have we managed to cover during the

2162
02:40:18,450 --> 02:40:26,311
competition during the hackathon

2163
02:40:21,230 --> 02:40:30,600
collecting the logs then the analytics

2164
02:40:26,311 --> 02:40:34,801
and sending that to Mongo for the score

2165
02:40:30,601 --> 02:40:38,671
to be studied and for actions and

2166
02:40:34,801 --> 02:40:44,551
decisions to be made in the background

2167
02:40:38,671 --> 02:40:48,501
we'll have a process can we see the

2168
02:40:44,551 --> 02:40:53,189
whitelist table up on the screen right

2169
02:40:48,501 --> 02:40:56,041
because analytics first checks if an IP

2170
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:58,381
is on the whitelist and then nothing

2171
02:40:56,041 --> 02:41:01,561
happens but if it's not on that

2172
02:40:58,381 --> 02:41:06,270
whitelist then we have to check the

2173
02:41:01,561 --> 02:41:09,841
scoring table and decide which measure

2174
02:41:06,271 --> 02:41:12,181
should be implemented and when that

2175
02:41:09,841 --> 02:41:17,190
happens well we've covered the

2176
02:41:12,181 --> 02:41:20,280
distribution of actions the IP table

2177
02:41:17,190 --> 02:41:24,950
that the rules so that the rules can run

2178
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:28,141
on IP tables for that attacker and then

2179
02:41:24,950 --> 02:41:30,211
well this is something we did wrong

2180
02:41:28,141 --> 02:41:30,910
because we've got this particular one on

2181
02:41:30,211 --> 02:41:35,850
the y

2182
02:41:30,910 --> 02:41:35,851
list and then is not going to work so

2183
02:41:37,860 --> 02:41:49,090
which elements did we not have time to

2184
02:41:42,370 --> 02:41:54,670
cover because of errors we made for

2185
02:41:49,090 --> 02:41:57,340
instance we have not analyzed the logs

2186
02:41:54,670 --> 02:42:01,660
we had problems with parsing the logs

2187
02:41:57,340 --> 02:42:02,590
the elastic didn't get the Jason's as it

2188
02:42:01,660 --> 02:42:09,070
should have done

2189
02:42:02,590 --> 02:42:11,950
we couldn't compare with a blacklist we

2190
02:42:09,070 --> 02:42:14,740
had to externalize configs because at

2191
02:42:11,950 --> 02:42:18,280
the moment technical users are on the

2192
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:23,080
headers that should be improved for the

2193
02:42:18,280 --> 02:42:26,561
future we wanted to do re-indexing of

2194
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:29,590
the elastic indices and we haven't done

2195
02:42:26,561 --> 02:42:33,699
that so when we analyze the logs they're

2196
02:42:29,590 --> 02:42:36,851
raised logically in the future and we

2197
02:42:33,700 --> 02:42:41,351
should have re-indexing of those logs so

2198
02:42:36,851 --> 02:42:44,800
they're not lost there should also be

2199
02:42:41,351 --> 02:42:48,460
some triggers on the Mongo database so

2200
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:54,279
that there's panning or D by deepening

2201
02:42:48,460 --> 02:42:56,891
we're needed so there I made another

2202
02:42:54,280 --> 02:43:01,570
mistake I removed one

2203
02:42:56,891 --> 02:43:08,920
I shouldn't have removed so now because

2204
02:43:01,570 --> 02:43:12,750
I run it twice then is there panning and

2205
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:12,750
D burning is not going to work properly

2206
02:43:19,030 --> 02:43:33,140
so if the system gets blocked and this

2207
02:43:23,330 --> 02:43:34,550
is the way to deep and I have to add the

2208
02:43:33,140 --> 02:43:47,000
one that I'd removed before otherwise I

2209
02:43:34,550 --> 02:43:49,640
will be burning myself on the background

2210
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:51,830
this is the deepening task checking

2211
02:43:49,640 --> 02:43:56,240
which ones are bad and which one are

2212
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:59,720
going to the whitelist we need to have

2213
02:43:56,240 --> 02:44:02,300
the heart or the bore of the changing of

2214
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:05,349
this one but still we don't have the way

2215
02:44:02,300 --> 02:44:08,539
of doing it Cyndi's on docker we can

2216
02:44:05,350 --> 02:44:19,670
dump that the container and go life

2217
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:23,150
again but before I do ban them yes I

2218
02:44:19,670 --> 02:44:27,640
defined it too fast let me show the clip

2219
02:44:23,150 --> 02:44:30,080
again let me say about the future and

2220
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:31,910
lets me talk about the future we haven't

2221
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:34,630
discussed the future yet but we want to

2222
02:44:31,910 --> 02:44:37,820
see that the well the idea is that every

2223
02:44:34,630 --> 02:44:41,810
machine sends the same file bit and we

2224
02:44:37,820 --> 02:44:44,270
have one index on elasticsearch and so

2225
02:44:41,810 --> 02:44:46,189
maybe the key would be too long so the

2226
02:44:44,271 --> 02:44:48,890
idea is for every mission to send the

2227
02:44:46,190 --> 02:44:50,450
index and with multi-processing we would

2228
02:44:48,890 --> 02:44:55,210
gather one of the index and then treat

2229
02:44:50,450 --> 02:45:00,130
them individually i had banned this one

2230
02:44:55,210 --> 02:45:04,429
and from the IP tables in the machines

2231
02:45:00,130 --> 02:45:07,039
and we see that the virtual machine one

2232
02:45:04,430 --> 02:45:12,010
IP had been bantered several times and

2233
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:16,850
when added to the white list steel band

2234
02:45:12,010 --> 02:45:19,880
and then removed them and when we're

2235
02:45:16,850 --> 02:45:23,359
back it works a must be too fast and

2236
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:25,538
maybe too messy and that's

2237
02:45:23,359 --> 02:45:25,539
enough

2238
02:45:39,630 --> 02:45:44,769
bueno hey como yeah I must have in our

2239
02:45:42,580 --> 02:45:50,020
last present a few nerves he since we're

2240
02:45:44,770 --> 02:45:52,630
done with that well we have 13 extra

2241
02:45:50,020 --> 02:45:54,460
minutes this is a first

2242
02:45:52,630 --> 02:45:57,130
actually we got 13 minutes because

2243
02:45:54,460 --> 02:46:00,250
there's a team missing I'll check but I

2244
02:45:57,130 --> 02:46:04,569
think there's no one from a Blix here so

2245
02:46:00,250 --> 02:46:07,920
that you see that we had measured it to

2246
02:46:04,569 --> 02:46:12,489
the beat let me thank you for having

2247
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:16,000
stuck to time when was the time to be

2248
02:46:12,489 --> 02:46:19,300
over which is painful on us but for this

2249
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:21,909
hackathon we thought it would be three

2250
02:46:19,300 --> 02:46:24,220
hours but because of a larger amount of

2251
02:46:21,909 --> 02:46:26,830
teams we had to stick to the time that

2252
02:46:24,220 --> 02:46:28,710
we had had for some time and we would

2253
02:46:26,830 --> 02:46:31,029
have liked to give you more time for

2254
02:46:28,710 --> 02:46:36,159
final presentations where you're risking

2255
02:46:31,029 --> 02:46:37,840
it all but it wasn't possible so let me

2256
02:46:36,159 --> 02:46:40,960
well we do whatever you want we can

2257
02:46:37,840 --> 02:46:42,370
start with questions here and use all

2258
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:45,039
the time but I think a break would be

2259
02:46:42,370 --> 02:46:48,220
better so that you clear your heads and

2260
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:51,899
see you back at 6 now the hackathon room

2261
02:46:48,220 --> 02:46:54,369
and that we will have the Q&A right and

2262
02:46:51,899 --> 02:46:56,789
ready for sentence thank you very much

2263
02:46:54,370 --> 02:46:56,790
to all of you

2264
02:46:56,920 --> 02:47:00,809
[Applause]

2265
02:47:01,561 --> 02:47:09,990
you

2266
