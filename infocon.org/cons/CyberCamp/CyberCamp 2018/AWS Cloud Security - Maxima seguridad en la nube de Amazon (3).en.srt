24
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,600

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:47,040
fortunately thank you very much for

28
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:51,119
coming so I've prepared a workshop with

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,720
an introduction to the most common

30
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,649
services that we can find on the Amazon

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,259
Cloud I want to summarize the best

32
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,060
practices and security recommendations

33
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,580
given for each and every one of them

34
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,340
here we have the table of common

35
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,859
contents

36
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,430
starting with a little bit of background

37
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:19,540
about myself about what I do then an

38
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:22,870
introduction of for Amazon for Amazon

39
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:27,609
Web Services how many of you have used a

40
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:31,239
AWS please raise your hands and how many

41
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:35,769
of you have gone in depth into it so

42
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,470
you've got a superficial knowledge as

43
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:45,970
far as I can see but no in-depth

44
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:48,819
knowledge so what is I WS I am which is

45
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,519
for user authentication will see that

46
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:55,089
first then what tools we have for data

47
00:02:51,519 --> 00:03:00,660
protection which infrastructure services

48
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:04,840
we have on WPC machines and all of that

49
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,700
then the container services I have very

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:13,560
little time so I'll just tell you about

51
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:18,720
the databases about D s then abstract

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:21,370
services mostly s3 and then finally

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:28,620
specific services for security that

54
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:30,720
Amazon gives us so

55
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,519
I'll tell you a little bit about myself

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:39,150
and what I do what I've been covering

57
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,700
and why I want to tell you about this

58
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:48,390
particular topic so my name is Chris

59
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:55,129
Tobin I'm an IT engineer I then did my

60
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:59,359
master's degree in Madrid on ICT and

61
00:03:55,129 --> 00:04:02,099
then I've been working with auditing so

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,760
during my professional career I've been

63
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:11,399
working mostly with cloud the cloud in

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:15,000
twin in 2007 I was given an award for

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:19,200
that and then I also have the Microsoft

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,380
active professional certificate so it's

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,570
all started with development and

68
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:28,020
management of different projects I then

69
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:33,000
started to go more in depth into

70
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:37,010
security as a freelancer I've also been

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,910
working I as sighs OH

72
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:47,310
and I've been very much involved with

73
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:50,099
Amazon that's what I keep busy with so

74
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:55,500
I'm here to tell you about Amazon Amazon

75
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:59,610
Web Services AWS provides different

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:07,590
services where we can work with

77
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:09,539
computation in the cloud so we have

78
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:14,210
three different types of services first

79
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:17,280
infrastructure as a service that

80
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:21,180
contributes all basic elements that we

81
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,809
need for the infrastructure then the

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,129
platform as a service with different

83
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:33,979
utilities and

84
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:37,319
everything we need that's up and running

85
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:40,409
for configuration and settings but not

86
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:44,159
very much in depth and then the typical

87
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:48,120
service for instance email and different

88
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:51,050
tools that we have in the cloud that we

89
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,970
can use but we have no access to

90
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,229
configure it and work with settings very

91
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,340
much so

92
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:02,639
in Amazon they work with a shared model

93
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:06,750
that's how they call it so well we work

94
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,740
with Amazon there's part of security

95
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:14,969
that Amazon looks after and another part

96
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:19,800
we have to cover so what is cloud

97
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:22,199
security is tasks that Amazon needs to

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,440
comply with for the architecture

99
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,810
underlying the services for instance

100
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,969
machine security the security of the

101
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:35,449
virtualizing layer the everything that

102
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:37,860
has to do with our data centers

103
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:43,020
logically that's not something we should

104
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,849
be concerned with and then we have the

105
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,029
other side of the coin that's what we

106
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:52,080
need to cover that would be security in

107
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:56,099
the cloud when I'm using Amazon services

108
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,758
then it's my responsibility to take into

109
00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:03,360
account a or everything I do is secure

110
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,849
for instance a configuration for my

111
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,900
firewall or the software that I'm going

112
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:13,500
to be using and so on so certifications

113
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,929
unconformity how does that work in

114
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:21,750
Amazon there is a very large team of

115
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:26,340
people experts in security who guarantee

116
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:30,180
that all of that complies with laws and

117
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:33,779
regulations and requirements so when we

118
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,520
have a project that we want to run on

119
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,490
Amazon

120
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,520
and it needs to comply with a number of

121
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:45,300
different certifications and amazon has

122
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,789
a list for those globally speaking that

123
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,169
would include cloud security alliance

124
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:53,759
eyes different

125
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:58,549
iso's that have to do with a cloud

126
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:02,220
environment different certifications

127
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,610
that are important in the US as well for

128
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:10,039
instance i often work with banking or

129
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:14,060
healthcare i Pam is important they're

130
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,060
different restrictions

131
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:25,139
depending on the area in the world those

132
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:32,130
change in the European Union the new

133
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:33,690
directive for privacy so they can play

134
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,870
with all of that what does that mean

135
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,690
their infrastructure is prepared to

136
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,000
comply with those certifications does

137
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:45,870
that mean that when I use Amazon

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,060
services I'm suddenly complying with

139
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,250
everything not really for instance the

140
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:55,469
s2 system right there's the s2 system

141
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,230
when if I want to have a website with

142
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:06,329
patient information for healthcare just

143
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:08,310
because I'm working with that system

144
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:13,410
does that mean that I'm complying with

145
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:16,739
HIPAA it doesn't for instance a web

146
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,600
portal where I can download information

147
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,810
on patients

148
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,870
well that's private information if I was

149
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:27,119
really useless and I did that wrong then

150
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:31,890
I might have to go to court I might be

151
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,370
sued so we still need to make an effort

152
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,040
to comply with those regulations even if

153
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,850
I'm using their services

154
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,000
what about trust and confidence when I

155
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,760
work with cloud services sometimes

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,730
people worry it's like working with

157
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,430
somebody else's computer instead of

158
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:56,200
having a data center dealing with that I

159
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:58,910
now have it in the cloud and Amazon

160
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,210
deals with that and I have to trust that

161
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:05,810
Amazon is doing that correctly in their

162
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:09,680
design when they set up a dainties data

163
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:13,369
center they find a place which is safe

164
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,270
from earthquakes from floods to

165
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,460
guarantee availability and security

166
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:23,079
what's about a physical access well

167
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:27,170
there is there are very strict policies

168
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:32,060
for third-party information access and

169
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:35,060
also to avoid destruction of resources

170
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:38,119
for instance Amazon has equipment like

171
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:41,449
this I don't know if you can imagine how

172
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:46,900
large that is in the real in in the real

173
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:51,590
world for instance an Amazon hard drive

174
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,209
when they're obsolete or when they're

175
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:57,710
not working properly

176
00:10:53,210 --> 00:11:00,050
well they first need to safely erase the

177
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:09,130
sectors seven times or something like

178
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:12,290
that but even after that this type of

179
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,689
machine would end up like this when

180
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:21,949
there is destroyed to make sure that all

181
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:24,980
information is safely erased so I think

182
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:30,140
that's probably enough for a background

183
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:34,600
on Amazon and now we're going to move to

184
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,600
the I am side of things

185
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:49,600
what is IA I am when we use an Amazon

186
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:55,420
account we can do it in different ways

187
00:11:49,600 --> 00:12:00,850
now not in the past because in the past

188
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:03,819
we used to say well I have an Amazon

189
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:09,960
account and then I can start the WPC

190
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:13,720
there are networks so I could have

191
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:18,090
different access to different networks

192
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:22,000
of theirs I could have a sub network for

193
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:24,400
security elements or even subdivide the

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,020
networks for the different departments

195
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,050
well that was in the past

196
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,840
now we don't need to have everything on

197
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:36,280
a single account with develop different

198
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:40,840
W pcs we now have the possibility to

199
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,060
have a master account and then other

200
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:47,140
accounts for different development

201
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:49,359
environments we could also have accounts

202
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,760
for security and different accounts for

203
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,670
different departments why is this an

204
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:59,350
advantage because we can separate things

205
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:02,050
in the past it was separated through WPC

206
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,450
but at the end of the day it was all

207
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:08,290
part of the same account so let me give

208
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:12,190
you an example in 2014 a company code

209
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:15,490
space one day suddenly allowed announced

210
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:18,100
they were closing down why because

211
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:21,760
somebody had accessed their system and

212
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:26,920
had erased everything they had on Amazon

213
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:31,030
somebody found the root user the main

214
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,699
user or it the only user and erased

215
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:38,380
everything the machines the hard drives

216
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:41,890
user details backups everything what can

217
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,810
you do in a situation like that nothing

218
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,990
really

219
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:51,229
if your recovery capabilities were part

220
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:54,140
of that account in that situation where

221
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,350
the root account has been stolen and

222
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,449
then there's nothing that can be done in

223
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:05,000
just a period of 12 hours that poor

224
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:10,480
company had to close down when I talk

225
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:15,790
about I am remember that whatever

226
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:23,260
structure you work with when you start

227
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:27,170
working with users W a years a years

228
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:29,330
would give you access for different

229
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,839
people different accesses for different

230
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,560
people

231
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:35,960
I am also allows to manage different

232
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:41,150
functions or what we sometimes call

233
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:43,760
roles with permits for different

234
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:47,150
elements in our infrastructure not

235
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,960
necessarily people it could be a machine

236
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:56,390
with different permissions to implement

237
00:14:50,960 --> 00:15:00,620
different actions we can also have users

238
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:04,910
for active directories in the companies

239
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:07,430
and why is that interesting because we

240
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:12,350
can then use a our corporate credentials

241
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:15,859
to then access Amazon resources

242
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:19,640
so let me clarify that I'll say that

243
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:23,960
Amazon allows for control and access

244
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:29,900
that's very very detailed for different

245
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:32,090
resources with multi-factor permits for

246
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,900
different levels of privilege

247
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:39,910
we can manage access control for mobile

248
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:42,470
applications as well it also allows to

249
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:49,459
integrate with a corporate active

250
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:53,000
directory so let's have a look now at a

251
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:56,240
summary for the IAM dashboard as a

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,580
reminder this is the Amazon dashboard I

253
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,280
think some of you will be familiar with

254
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,280
this let's go to the IAM section

255
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:13,000
can't you see that properly

256
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:24,920
let's hope this works

257
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:32,209
can you see it no I want you to see that

258
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:38,870
dashboard up on the screen can you now

259
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:41,149
grace so this is the I am dashboard with

260
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,000
a link you need to access for that type

261
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:47,980
of account the main screen with a

262
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,870
summary of safety security sorry

263
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:56,420
recommendations I mostly want you to

264
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,500
understand that when you start from

265
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,930
scratch with an Amazon account you have

266
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,970
account settings and this is a form

267
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:09,169
where you can define your security

268
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:11,630
policy for passwords when you first

269
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,569
start with an account you have to define

270
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:18,260
everything from scratch with the usual

271
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:23,949
options for length whether you're going

272
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:26,740
to be capital letters or not you can

273
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:31,100
finely-tuned this to your needs

274
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:33,410
what about users we can create nominal

275
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,860
users because some users will access

276
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,870
through the dashboard and other users

277
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,600
through programs if you use that

278
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:44,928
dashboard you will need a password and

279
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,230
if you want to use programs to access

280
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:53,270
resources then Amazon gives you an

281
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:56,480
access key so that you can access that

282
00:17:53,270 --> 00:18:03,070
so everything you can do through the

283
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:07,499
dashboard is going to be using an API so

284
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:12,158
everything goes through the Amazon API

285
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:14,769
when you create a new user it asks you

286
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:17,229
what type of access you're going to have

287
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:24,269
through the dashboard and then you need

288
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:24,269
a password or as I said through programs

289
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:45,279
we can add tabs and then here I can

290
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:50,289
create a new user so I've created a new

291
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:55,119
user with an access key the user will

292
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:58,019
have a passport a country do anything

293
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:02,080
with it until I'm giving the permit but

294
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:05,229
to access resources through programs and

295
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:10,539
then we should use both the access key

296
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:14,409
and this credential here and Amazon

297
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:17,559
doesn't save the secret key it does save

298
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:19,809
the access key but not their secret key

299
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:28,779
so if I don't save that tab that's it

300
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:34,599
it's gone so access information calls by

301
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:38,590
email normally but not the access key

302
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:42,700
that would come through an encrypted zip

303
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:46,389
file so that nobody can hold of it users

304
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:50,039
can be grouped together and what's the

305
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:53,668
idea there to make administration easier

306
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:58,749
because when users are granted a permit

307
00:19:53,669 --> 00:20:01,720
it's much better to do so as a group it

308
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:06,460
makes the system more simple and not to

309
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:10,899
forget giving somebody the permission or

310
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:14,590
not giving too high a level so that's

311
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:16,809
normally done through departments so

312
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:22,509
that the whole department is given it at

313
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:27,210
the same time so groups allows allow to

314
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:30,700
add users specify the level of permit I

315
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:33,090
can't go into too much detail because my

316
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,159
workshop is more about security

317
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,070
recommendations not about how to use the

318
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,029
system

319
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:45,039
here we can see the different rows now

320
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:49,039
those are permits that are given to

321
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,169
elements who are not people they can

322
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,289
also be given to people but normally

323
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:58,639
rows are given to a lambda or to a

324
00:20:54,289 --> 00:21:03,649
machine and I also want to want you to

325
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:06,709
see this the credential report this is

326
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:09,979
an account I prepared just to show you

327
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:14,750
here at cyber camp and why is this

328
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:21,740
interesting this example because as an

329
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:24,470
admin of an of an Amazon account you

330
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,350
should have exhaustive control of what

331
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:31,730
your users to so you can generate a

332
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:33,620
report we've seen that earlier this is a

333
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,980
real example I've changed some of the

334
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:39,918
details logically for this Amazon

335
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:43,509
account here we can see all the users

336
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:47,389
for the account when the user was

337
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:50,409
registered if they have a password so

338
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:54,529
they can access the dashboard or not

339
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:58,190
when they last used used it when they

340
00:21:54,529 --> 00:22:01,309
last used that password if they've got

341
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,889
the routing of password activated or not

342
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:07,549
if they have an access key when they

343
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:12,320
used it all the necessary information

344
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:14,870
for me to know if the user is making a

345
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:20,269
good use normal use of the account or

346
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:26,539
any users who are not using Amazon

347
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:29,240
services at the end of the day the

348
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:32,090
security recommendation that tends to be

349
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:36,529
applied for accounts is the following

350
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:39,678
you first need to have a secure password

351
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:42,110
policy for your users because when you

352
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:46,100
first create the Amazon account the

353
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:49,539
policies don't just happen

354
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,879
cause you need to set them up then

355
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:58,910
credentials and passwords need to be

356
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:02,120
renewed and changed regularly access

357
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:04,419
keys should not be shared and you might

358
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,010
be surprised but this is actually every

359
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:09,410
reasonably common practice

360
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:14,480
what about recommendations for the root

361
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:18,260
account when we create our Amazon

362
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:22,789
account well this one should only be

363
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:25,549
used at to give users permits after that

364
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,530
that user should never be used again

365
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:29,780
just to avoid the problem that I

366
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:33,500
mentioned earlier with that poor company

367
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:36,020
and that had two columns down if

368
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,320
possible we would buy a physical token

369
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:43,280
for that user we would keep the token in

370
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:47,658
a safe I say a safe or whatever is going

371
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:51,590
to be safe because the root user is the

372
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:56,030
only one who has the possibility of a

373
00:23:51,590 --> 00:24:01,668
raising an account or we could even set

374
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:06,200
for alert for a text message and to be

375
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:09,250
sent every every time a user accesses

376
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:13,309
the account that might be a good idea

377
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:20,210
the root user should never have access

378
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:23,960
key allocated some more recommendations

379
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:27,159
for users here those with privileges

380
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,140
well we need to a neighbor the

381
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:34,460
multi-factor option I forgot to show you

382
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:36,890
earlier that when you in your security

383
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:40,640
credentials here you have an option

384
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:43,460
where you can add a second factor that

385
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:48,580
can be virtual in nature or it could be

386
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,580
a physical key it's quite simple

387
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:59,760
creating individual ad I I am uses

388
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:02,189
nominal users is the way to do it not

389
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,150
group who says why because everything

390
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:09,180
goes through the Amazon API so all of

391
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:12,300
that is recorded on a log and if we had

392
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:15,810
shared to users then and something goes

393
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:18,980
wrong we won't know who to blame and we

394
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:23,370
have to know who's done what and why and

395
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:29,580
later on we'll see some examples we need

396
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:31,949
to have groups when we give permits we

397
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:35,300
should never give individual permits to

398
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:41,310
a particular user we need to also review

399
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:44,430
the needs to pass keys not everybody

400
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:51,840
should have programmatic access to the

401
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:54,180
dashboard about access keys there is the

402
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,830
danger that somebody might leave the

403
00:25:54,180 --> 00:26:01,080
access access key in a machine and

404
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:04,740
that's terribly dangerous because the

405
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:09,240
access key allows you to do whatever is

406
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:14,820
being given permission to do that needs

407
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:19,220
to be avoided so that the basic list I

408
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,220
showed you earlier can be complied with

409
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:28,260
now about the credentials and the report

410
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:31,620
I showed you this is important for

411
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:34,170
auditing and monitoring account

412
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,800
activities for us to be able to find

413
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:41,550
inactive users or keys so we can

414
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:45,840
eliminate unnecessary users for instance

415
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:48,620
a users who have not had access for a

416
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,850
year they should go

417
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:57,080
how our permits are located this is a

418
00:26:52,850 --> 00:27:00,860
policy a policy policies are pretty

419
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,679
hellish to manage at the beginning as

420
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:07,939
soon as you get the hang of it is not

421
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:10,730
too bad a policy tells you what you can

422
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:16,070
do or not with particular Amazon

423
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:19,520
elements structure is a JSON file you

424
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:22,129
should all also have the version on the

425
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,389
fire because it's a version of the JSON

426
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:30,590
file and this is not for you to say what

427
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:34,490
date that started it is a set value that

428
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:38,330
Amazon uses for validation purposes then

429
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:40,790
we have the ID and that you can change

430
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,909
that to whatever is good for you and

431
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:47,720
then we have those that triple field

432
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:51,070
effect action and resource effect means

433
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:54,400
if we allow or not whatever comes next

434
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:58,309
it just has two values allow or deny

435
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:01,220
then action that means what we're going

436
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:04,820
to be allowing or denying for different

437
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:08,660
resources here you have many different

438
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:12,200
options for Amazon resources and then

439
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:19,280
resource means force it is that the

440
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:22,370
action is going to be touching the

441
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:28,040
conditions here are to limit more or

442
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:30,469
less for instance if the IP making the

443
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:34,178
call has to come from a particular in it

444
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:39,100
has to fall within a particular range or

445
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:42,410
if whoever is doing it and needs to have

446
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:45,889
multi-factor activated or if the

447
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:48,110
connection has to be secure because when

448
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:51,710
policies are allocated to a particular

449
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:55,600
user we should realize that Amazon

450
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:58,790
assesses policies in a particular way

451
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,659
originally we need to start and think

452
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:08,420
that everything is denied users can't do

453
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:12,820
anything when we first make them user

454
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:16,730
and then if there is explicit deny for

455
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:20,990
then the action will be denied if there

456
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:24,260
is no explicit deny then the system asks

457
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:27,020
if there is an explicit allow if there

458
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:31,370
is one then it would be allowed if there

459
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:34,670
isn't then it would be denied by default

460
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:37,909
because deny is always far greater then

461
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:40,910
allow in the system if one machine says

462
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:44,330
no' then the final result for all of the

463
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:46,070
machines will be no as well and now

464
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,129
we're going to see an example of how

465
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:51,649
these policies work as part of the

466
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,170
policies well this is an account which

467
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,700
is relatively new and we have four

468
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,460
hundred and sixty-eight policies where

469
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:00,710
is that goes Amazon gives us a large

470
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:05,900
amount of policies so that we can play

471
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:08,240
around with them so we filter those that

472
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,280
have been managed by Amazon those that

473
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,790
we've managed ourselves and only

474
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,850
recently we've seen some policies that

475
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:20,450
are kind of gold like policies we have

476
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:23,929
admin access invoicing database

477
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:26,720
administrator so this is more linked to

478
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:30,800
roles than the permit itself so when

479
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:34,370
building a policy a few years ago it was

480
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:37,370
old Jason so it was quite a mess but now

481
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:39,709
they've made our lives easier and you

482
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:43,040
are allowed to do so visually this

483
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:46,970
example here what we say is what service

484
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:51,170
we want to enable let's say that we will

485
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:54,530
have a policy for s3 and inside s3 we

486
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:56,820
will allow for lists and unwritten only

487
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:59,879
reading on s3

488
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,800
so it's read-only and we could also

489
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,140
indicate the kind of resources to which

490
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:08,580
we want to have access or grant access

491
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:10,770
rather and even conditions so we check

492
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:14,070
reveal and we will not be allowed

493
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:16,530
because we have not entered the bucket

494
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:21,149
we want to have acted a grant access to

495
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:34,220
in order to do this we need to state the

496
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:40,680
name of the bucket so let's say

497
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:43,530
read-only which is that what was the

498
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:48,150
date of the bucket and then the kind of

499
00:31:43,530 --> 00:32:00,930
objects we want for that bucket any

500
00:31:48,150 --> 00:32:06,660
object these will produce let's add a

501
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:11,340
description is always advisable I had

502
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:18,750
already created this one so again and

503
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:20,429
then filter following our own policies

504
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:24,150
and these are the ones we've just

505
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:26,250
created this is the Jason we have and

506
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:31,100
this is a structure we've seen every

507
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:34,050
action that can be run on s3 list get

508
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:36,480
read-only everything that is read-only

509
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:40,320
and this is the resource to which the

510
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,450
permits have been granted so bucket that

511
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,610
we've chosen and everything and line it

512
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:49,100
on top of it

513
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:49,100
it's an allow we've seen that

514
00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:02,029
so what about this policy we can

515
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:04,460
allocated the users or groups we've set

516
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:09,340
it's more interesting to do so with

517
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:13,039
groups we set it for the read-only group

518
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:18,279
so we allocate that policy we look for

519
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:22,009
it we look it up and we just click art

520
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:26,899
and that's the policy allocated to the

521
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:29,389
group so everyone so this is the grid

522
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:32,689
only user toboe would have that

523
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:37,998
permission granted complicated I would

524
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:49,090
say the policy is well they take

525
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:52,669
training security recommendations again

526
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:55,759
you might use whenever possible to use

527
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:58,309
the pumps is dictated by Amazon there

528
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:03,799
were over 600 policies already created

529
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:05,749
with a great wide range of options odds

530
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:08,239
are there's one that will suit our

531
00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:10,159
purpose but maybe that's not the case

532
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,428
that we might need something else that

533
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,679
is not there but if we can use one that

534
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:19,520
is already there even better

535
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,270
also grand minimum privileges as low as

536
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,280
possible

537
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:25,250
you always need two grand minimum

538
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,040
privileges and there's something very

539
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,579
cool about it which is the policy

540
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,579
simulator

541
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:37,250
we will not see that here but because I

542
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:40,460
don't have the time but this is an

543
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,739
interface where we can get a user and

544
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:47,569
say what if this user did this with this

545
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:51,020
policy here Amazon will simulate it and

546
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:54,619
will say I'll have it available or not

547
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:58,549
why do I see it so cool as I said before

548
00:34:54,619 --> 00:35:01,020
Amazon uses API so when you're sending

549
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:04,770
calls within

550
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,869
the interface of the web dashboard the

551
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:13,110
command you run is the last thing to be

552
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:17,780
done if you don't want to grant access

553
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:21,090
to user for example to erase a database

554
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:23,850
this is only done when they click

555
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:26,550
diddling it so if you go in and you

556
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:28,980
choose the lead and ask are you sure you

557
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:31,860
want to backup you can print and click

558
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,450
yes yes yes but until you press delete

559
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:37,170
or click delete you don't know whether

560
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:40,910
the policy you said is right when what

561
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:43,650
if you've got the wrong mistake and

562
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:47,520
you've deleted the database because you

563
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:50,430
haven't set the policy which is quite a

564
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,250
pain so these will allow for that kind

565
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,879
of simulation without druing it a few

566
00:35:53,250 --> 00:36:00,450
years ago this was not available and

567
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:05,369
it's been quite welcome federate users

568
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:07,618
and we've said we can you can build or

569
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:11,310
create and federal active directories

570
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:14,400
from other companies and that will allow

571
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:16,980
for several things such as having just

572
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,869
one user and password for everything

573
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:23,820
making things easier and you will narrow

574
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:25,800
down security risks because in the end

575
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,020
you will only have one place where you

576
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,750
will be managing all those passwords you

577
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,550
will always need to defend that and you

578
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:35,790
will have a global policy for the whole

579
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:40,670
world without having to have a single

580
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:43,800
policy for every password environment

581
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:47,070
but the fact that you don't need to type

582
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:57,359
14 passwords for 14 signs well that's a

583
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:59,850
plan I've read that the IT well I

584
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,859
thought that people lost lot of wasted

585
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:06,080
lots of time recovering passwords so

586
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:06,080
having a password hab it's interesting

587
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,970
let me show you a video a short clip not

588
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:16,420
the way to set up the Federation because

589
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:18,069
it's just and set up thin but I want to

590
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:27,100
show you the example of what it would

591
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:31,300
mean this is a federation I'm going into

592
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:35,680
you this corporate site my password and

593
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:38,260
my user federated against Amazon so the

594
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,180
credential allows me to allow me to go

595
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:49,630
into Amazon and I don't need to have a

596
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:52,690
specific user so you built roads so if

597
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:56,820
you go into directory you are allocated

598
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,820
the role identify within Amazon for that

599
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:10,690
so

600
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:13,359
now we move - I am I am well we've done

601
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:15,540
brother with I am now we move on to data

602
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,680
protection as part of Amazon or any

603
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,210
environment we want to protect our

604
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,500
information from two different

605
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:32,200
viewpoints communication and storage and

606
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:34,330
there so Amazon gives us a service which

607
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,210
is certificate manager certificate

608
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:39,960
manager allows us to have certificates

609
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:43,980
that we can use as part of our

610
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:47,500
communications and so we can create

611
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:50,710
secured communications on the transport

612
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,730
layer for example with SSL those

613
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:55,839
certificates

614
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:59,830
wha-hoo are free so if you've ever had

615
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:03,009
to buy them they're expensive but Amazon

616
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:08,080
gives this for free for 13 months that

617
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:13,630
we can renew Monsen and these are Rs a

618
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:15,520
also 48 feed and also other practicals

619
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:18,280
what you can find in the market but

620
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,680
again free of charge those certificates

621
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,650
we will be able to use in front of the

622
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:26,169
balancers we will have them for content

623
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:29,020
distribution on platform when we create

624
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:34,390
our own api's or even in more complex

625
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:36,490
services such as elastic services which

626
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,910
means that in the past you will get a

627
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:42,310
server get a certificate and make sure

628
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,770
that you would activate the HTTP

629
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:47,080
communication problem here as well is

630
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:49,480
not that it is a problem but it's an

631
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,480
issue where the server itself has to be

632
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,280
in charge of encryption tasks and so

633
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,460
you're adding complexity to it and then

634
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:02,790
Amazon or this kind of services have

635
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,790
been designed for self escalation and so

636
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:09,140
you need to have that identify different

637
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:12,200
server and everything but Amazon will

638
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,390
allow you to add a balancer in front of

639
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,399
the machines and allocate the

640
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,839
certificate to that given balances so

641
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,330
every communication with the machine

642
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,210
will be through the balance or the

643
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:25,610
balancer will be the one in charge of

644
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:27,590
the encryption and communication tasks

645
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,540
and then with a balancer to the server

646
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,850
well we can forget about that because

647
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,470
that internal communication we can also

648
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:36,710
add a certificate there if we wish to

649
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:39,529
but once we are inside the UPS Singh

650
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:42,200
wiki ma understand that we do not need

651
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:45,310
the encrypted communication because the

652
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,520
first threshold that is the balancer is

653
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:50,299
passed

654
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:52,520
we've passed it if we request a

655
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:56,170
certificate this is the second clip we

656
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,759
don't have any more clips but this is a

657
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:01,670
video where a clip because requesting a

658
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,600
certificate takes some time and I just

659
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,600
wanted you to see it

660
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:15,750
if we go into certificate manager with

661
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,850
stately domain for which we won the

662
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:20,550
certificate and we need to own the

663
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,740
domain we cannot build or generate a

664
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:26,340
certificate for cyber camp or anything

665
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:28,680
of the sort it has to be ours because

666
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,470
the next step will be to verify that we

667
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:35,460
own the domain here for the example I

668
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:37,649
said Oh case email me to my user because

669
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:40,430
that's right domain and so it's easy for

670
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:45,540
me it's a verified you will get an email

671
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:49,890
as you see it here so this is to be

672
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:52,860
validated as well and when you get the

673
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:54,600
email do you click on the link you get

674
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,750
to this tab and you say yeah this is me

675
00:41:54,600 --> 00:42:00,020
built give me the certificate and once

676
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:06,480
you've got it all validate it

677
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:08,730
so we refresh it it's been assured and

678
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,290
with this certificate we can use it

679
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,290
throughout our infrastructure

680
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:30,360
let me close this down or else we keep

681
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:33,060
going on as for the security of the data

682
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:35,910
that are dressed in all the information

683
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,750
we had stored in hard drives rs3

684
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,750
anywhere

685
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:46,560
we have Amazon PMS or key management

686
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:57,990
servers for encryption keys that we

687
00:42:46,560 --> 00:43:00,090
produce in our infrastructure so we see

688
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:02,129
what roles they can manage we can use

689
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:06,110
them you can use it you can manage it

690
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:10,830
and we can design they rotate

691
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:14,160
automatically so you will generate a key

692
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:16,410
that they are not work that that will

693
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,290
rotate and it is a transparent process

694
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:23,670
for everyone we can enable and disable

695
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:25,680
them temporarily you can add it once

696
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:29,700
know that you can add it but we will be

697
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,700
auditing when we get to that point you

698
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,919
can add it the way those keys are used

699
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,899
we will know whose use them and what for

700
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,790
and everything else and there's

701
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:43,920
something important here that is that we

702
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:45,779
can bring to Cape m/s what we had from

703
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,510
our environment so we have a series of

704
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:53,190
servers and CPD and we can upload it and

705
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:57,089
no problem there kms

706
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:59,190
as integrated with or embedded with

707
00:43:57,089 --> 00:44:02,310
interesting services such as EVs hard

708
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:04,950
drives and see that in a minute with s3

709
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:09,328
which is a mass storage so anything that

710
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:13,020
is datastore which we can use JMS we can

711
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:14,910
use that with databases that's where we

712
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,089
keep all the information and of course

713
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:23,670
as I said before we'll send it to power

714
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:30,540
flood trail gee is it for the auditing

715
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:32,940
of what was we've done I will not play

716
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:35,759
the demo of kms because it's pretty

717
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:42,079
simple and since we are short on time I

718
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:45,810
had to summarize said kms

719
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:48,359
recommendations for information

720
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,599
encryption without transit information

721
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:54,089
and rest and information security

722
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:55,349
recommendation always make sure that we

723
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:58,349
you will encrypt the transfer

724
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:00,569
information on your system and you need

725
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:03,089
to make sure that you encrypt the rest

726
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:06,210
and information as well every time in

727
00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:09,930
case it's not clear do encrypt the

728
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,250
encrypt do encrypt may be a year some

729
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,529
few years back it might have been a

730
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:16,440
problem but with a computing power that

731
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:20,160
we have today having it all encrypted it

732
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,260
is not the delay it's not a parent it

733
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,410
only brings or something good so years

734
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,410
it

735
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:45,780
so let's see infrastructure services UPC

736
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:48,270
is next this is just a virtual a network

737
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:50,190
a private virtual network where you can

738
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:54,720
feed all the elements that we'll be

739
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:58,010
using there so these will allow us to

740
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:02,310
control it or IP rage years we will have

741
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:06,150
tables and everything let's we will be

742
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:08,220
able to lock several eyepieces VP says

743
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:10,620
alright as I said when we started we

744
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:13,140
have several of them we can connect them

745
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:16,380
to each other and we need visibility we

746
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:19,080
can also have sub networks we which are

747
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:21,240
public and we can also have private sub

748
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:27,270
networks that communicate to the

749
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:32,459
Internet through those addresses to give

750
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:36,750
you an overview this is our Amazon

751
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:39,480
account where we can build a vpz but not

752
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:43,470
just one several of them there's this

753
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:46,140
circle which is the point that indicates

754
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:49,649
the network the output network we can

755
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:56,670
connect them to each other with the VP's

756
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:57,420
appearing and we can have several

757
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,890
subnets

758
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,930
we can decide whether we want them

759
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:04,190
private or public and each will have its

760
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,569
own route or path table if I will

761
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:11,130
networks

762
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:14,130
apart from producing subnets we can also

763
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:17,190
see availability areas just to summarize

764
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:19,260
what this is basically Amazon has data

765
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:21,570
centers scattered all over the world

766
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,040
that's what they call regions and inside

767
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,380
every region there are several

768
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,360
availability areas for example island

769
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,980
doesn't mean that there's just one data

770
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,680
center in Ireland they have two or three

771
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:34,410
and there you can decide where in which

772
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,120
an availability area you want to stuff

773
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:39,330
to be because

774
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:42,150
they are separate or about enough so if

775
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:45,509
there is a catastrophe and one is

776
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:47,310
crushed you can have it elsewhere and

777
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:53,490
you don't lose all the infrastructure

778
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:56,340
down there a clear example here is when

779
00:47:53,490 --> 00:48:01,680
we set up a BBC with high availability

780
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:06,060
here we would have an VP same with a

781
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,040
subnet segment inside which is

782
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:11,040
availability one and then another one is

783
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,710
availability - so we will use only one

784
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,620
but if there's a catastrophe for this it

785
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:20,100
has to be a true disaster but if the

786
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:22,080
whole area is down with a router we can

787
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,540
direct all requested the second

788
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:26,759
availability area and that's where none

789
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:31,740
of our clients will learn there has been

790
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:33,090
a problem if all others crash as well or

791
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,310
a whole region that's something

792
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:38,520
different and we can even have

793
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:42,210
contingency plans and keep things in

794
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:45,140
different regions and know that you be

795
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:51,960
ready that would be a zombie attack or

796
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:57,600
well quite quite we are as part of the

797
00:48:51,960 --> 00:49:00,720
network and subnets we have the not else

798
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:05,460
it is a security layer that can be

799
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:08,430
allocated to every subnet in there so

800
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:14,130
that's a wolf list we can indicate

801
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:20,310
protocols ports and choose acceptance or

802
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:27,060
denial denial rules not

803
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:31,290
else are allocated to subnet thus the

804
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:38,220
goal is the same but we'll use it for

805
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:42,440
Amazon so at a given point we can have

806
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,439
subnet rules and also machine rules

807
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,750
so let's see what would you do or means

808
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:09,310
will be same this one I built myself

809
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:18,240
sigh become a teen for a development

810
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:22,150
environment which has an ID will be

811
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:25,959
there we see the allocated subnets we

812
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:27,280
can have the VBC filter and if you see

813
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,119
there's four subnets

814
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:35,050
to private subnets and to public subnets

815
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,890
each of which on different availability

816
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,680
areas

817
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:41,049
ade z1 is different from a ZT these are

818
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:45,879
two different areas each of them has its

819
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:51,819
own path table have it here over you can

820
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:54,520
see rules as well the knuckles we are

821
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:59,200
allowing all of the traffic initially so

822
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:01,540
you have them here path route can be

823
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,810
assigned a relegated to several subnet

824
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:08,109
or just one I would recommend having one

825
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:10,599
per subnet and even if they are similar

826
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:13,060
but then we can distinguish them based

827
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:16,470
on what we need we also have the

828
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:20,700
Internet gateway that is the output for

829
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:20,700
the Internet

830
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:28,050
so I say it is interesting these

831
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:32,549
connections these peering connections so

832
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:35,010
TV pieces see each other we only say

833
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:39,480
which source and which destination our

834
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:42,090
input and output and as long as the IP

835
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,780
segments we've defined can see each

836
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:49,770
other so if both BBC's have the same IP

837
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:51,180
ranges there will be some colliding

838
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,190
going on

839
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:56,430
so when building a V PC you really need

840
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:58,920
to have designed the ranges that you

841
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:02,368
will choose so if in the future you need

842
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,810
to have them connected you need to be

843
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,220
able to do so because it cannot be

844
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:08,790
changed afterwards after it's been

845
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:11,069
created here you have the Knuckles we've

846
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:13,440
seen before access to all security

847
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:17,000
groups security groups will see that in

848
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,000
detail when we get to the machines

849
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:25,440
something else when you build a V PC

850
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:32,100
there is this option which is flowing

851
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:34,770
locks flow logs is information going on

852
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:37,680
inside your network well if you create

853
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:39,720
them because they are off initially you

854
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,629
can choose when you well let me explain

855
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,970
what what is this a flow log mainly what

856
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:47,310
we're saying is well everything going on

857
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:49,649
inside the network I wanna record it I

858
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:51,779
want to have a log where I see

859
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:54,060
everything going on you know that you

860
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:59,640
built it I can decide whether I want to

861
00:52:54,060 --> 00:53:01,920
grab all requests accepted or denied or

862
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,430
maybe all of it I can have it on the

863
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,430
cloud watch

864
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:12,140
this is one of the tools that amazon al

865
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:14,540
offers to the lots of things very much

866
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:17,799
fun and whether we want it in a bucket

867
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:21,680
to process it with other kinds of tools

868
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:24,730
as soon as we built it we can see

869
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,730
everything going on

870
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:40,629
security recommendations regarding VP

871
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:47,050
says but mainly don't use it by defect

872
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:50,410
by default sorry so use one of your own

873
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:52,090
instead of the one predefined by Amazon

874
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:54,160
so with your own IP range and everything

875
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:55,750
you need you cannot delete it so don't

876
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,850
you waste your time trying to delete it

877
00:53:55,750 --> 00:54:01,390
because you want to be able separate

878
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:03,819
your business needs in different VPC

879
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:05,980
environments I said that as I as we

880
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:07,660
started you can think of an environment

881
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,250
Blatz of VP sees other with the

882
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:11,890
different accounts if you choose to have

883
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:12,430
different be pieces separate them put

884
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:15,220
them apart

885
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:17,319
I found clients that had one single VP

886
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:18,910
seat inside of which they would have

887
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:22,000
development environments production

888
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:24,430
environments that's madness total

889
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:28,990
madness keep it all as separate as you

890
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:30,700
can use only the pink when needed if -

891
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:31,120
favi pieces didn't need to see each

892
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,879
other

893
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:40,240
comes near see each other enable the

894
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:43,420
flow logs as I just said it is so simple

895
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:46,629
and not costly when it comes to money

896
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:50,140
and it helps for auditing and everything

897
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:53,290
else it uses a well-defined model in

898
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:54,850
work and decide what that is private or

899
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:59,980
public if you want subnets for the

900
00:54:54,850 --> 00:55:02,500
database anything you need on private

901
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,330
subnets have everything that does not

902
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,800
need to have access to the public if

903
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:08,740
it's not a web server if you don't need

904
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,840
anyone going into it and then move it to

905
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:13,540
the private part use the knuckles to

906
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,790
grant and deny access generally speaking

907
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:18,160
when I say general let's begin what I

908
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:20,610
mean is if I use a macro where I state

909
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:25,810
that all the machines inside the net

910
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:27,400
segment have the port to deny it doesn't

911
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:31,299
matter whether on the security group I

912
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:34,180
say yes because the network policy trams

913
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:37,000
every other policy use the knuckle to

914
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:40,480
restrict IP access and not the security

915
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,300
groups and remember as I was saying the

916
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:44,840
knuckle

917
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:47,660
rules have top priority over others any

918
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:50,030
thinners and don't use the security

919
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:52,640
groups that you get by default delete

920
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:54,980
this rules well you cannot delete the

921
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:58,100
groups but you can delete the rules and

922
00:55:54,980 --> 00:56:00,320
those that are by default grant access

923
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:03,560
and you might forget and allocated and

924
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:06,320
you can cause him quite a mess reference

925
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:08,930
to other security groups instead of IPs

926
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,640
and in a minute I'll show a security

927
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:13,669
group an example and you see we will be

928
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,580
allocating earning an IP but you can

929
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:20,450
also see a security group ID which is

930
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:23,150
praised but when you have to allow

931
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:24,980
access for different machine groups it's

932
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:27,380
a mess if you have to go into every

933
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:29,360
machine and say this is granted access

934
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:32,360
from seven machines and I state every LP

935
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,950
is much more fun so the machine that

936
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:37,180
belongs to this group you grant access

937
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:41,649
to this other group and so these are

938
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:44,569
permits for the group easy-to-manage

939
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:49,940
open just open the ports that are needed

940
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:52,880
if you don't need them close them and if

941
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:55,030
possible avoid the rules that grant

942
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,710
public access to your resources

943
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:59,600
naturally if you have our webserver it

944
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:03,820
has to region you have to have it but if

945
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,819
it's not strictly necessary avoid that

946
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:13,240
next infrastructure services see - easy

947
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:17,279
- these are just instances as they're

948
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:20,350
called these machines that we will be

949
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,480
getting live our hours because Amazon

950
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:25,750
cannot go in and do anything with them

951
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,880
if you go live with the machine this is

952
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,650
your access inside the machine and it's

953
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:33,220
your responsibility if it's not updated

954
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:36,010
if there are viruses man Amazon doesn't

955
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:38,770
go in this up to you to that to an

956
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:42,720
extend weather where if you lose your

957
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:49,690
password amazon says throw it away and

958
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:53,890
set another one up we will have access

959
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:56,020
and it will be SSH and with ARP whether

960
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:58,420
it's Linux or Windows that's would

961
00:57:56,020 --> 00:58:04,990
deciding that and the maintenance of

962
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:07,780
those machines isn't ask McGinnis I and

963
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:11,589
there are so many different machines

964
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:14,580
general use ones optimized for CPU all

965
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:19,350
sorts some of them are tiny

966
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:24,430
for instance CPU with half a Giga memory

967
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:27,400
to situations with 12 terabytes of RAM

968
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:31,710
memory so you have to choose from that

969
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:37,240
range what you need get the price right

970
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:41,500
so I can tell you going life with one of

971
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:45,490
these 12 terabyte machines is quite

972
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:49,450
amazing strongly recommend it and then

973
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:54,399
we have the key pairs and sample of both

974
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:57,460
public and private keys key pairs are

975
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:01,990
not given at the beginning by Amazon so

976
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:02,320
it's up to you what is a key in this

977
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:05,439
case

978
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,940
well it's something like this like we

979
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,450
can see up on the screen a very long

980
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:14,119
piece of text

981
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:16,879
then c2 has Amazon images what is that

982
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:19,550
well a security copy for that machine

983
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,270
you can say hey I've got this machine

984
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:25,849
here I'm going to save a copy as if it

985
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:29,990
were a backup just in case I want to

986
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:33,859
have another one go life if I scale up

987
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:37,549
the system then we have the marketplace

988
00:59:33,859 --> 00:59:40,369
where am i is it can be purchased or up

989
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:45,260
and running with different services for

990
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:53,140
instance and am i with a PHP with Apache

991
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:53,140
or whatever you do so or firewall tools

992
00:59:55,540 --> 01:00:04,940
all the information stored is stored on

993
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:10,849
EBS what is that well the disks from SSD

994
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:15,859
to the usual old HD disks the sizes go

995
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:23,859
from 500 tiga gigas to 12 terabytes how

996
01:00:15,859 --> 01:00:27,500
great big range well we use EBS disks a

997
01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:29,660
distance an instance sorry needs a hard

998
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:32,150
drive to work and then you can have

999
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:34,720
secondary disks so that's when the

1000
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:41,480
machine goes live you can decide to

1001
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:45,890
encode encrypt so all that information

1002
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:48,740
will be encrypted but the root disk for

1003
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:51,200
the machine to start it cannot be

1004
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:54,290
encrypted when the instance is created

1005
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,930
and yes you heard me right I know this

1006
01:00:54,290 --> 01:01:00,560
is quite surprising it cannot be done by

1007
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:02,960
default so what would you need to do

1008
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:07,880
it's not that complex look at an example

1009
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:11,630
a machine with a root unit so you would

1010
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:13,950
get that root volume and do a snapshot a

1011
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:17,099
security copy

1012
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:22,710
and then after that we can make another

1013
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:23,400
copy of our first copy and encode it so

1014
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,349
that's it

1015
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:29,280
you've encoded it you stop your machine

1016
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:32,960
you remove the roots units that you have

1017
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:35,520
without an encode encrypting and then

1018
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:38,450
keep going with your new encrypted one

1019
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:43,380
which is a bit of a pain in the neck you

1020
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:45,240
do your ami and then after that you can

1021
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:48,750
go live with the rest of the machines

1022
01:01:45,240 --> 01:02:01,709
you use let me just show you an example

1023
01:01:48,750 --> 01:02:07,380
of how that works here it is on f2 we've

1024
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:11,070
got the list of instances here of course

1025
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:15,900
the Ubuntu machine is a very little one

1026
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:17,790
with just a one Giga of RAM which works

1027
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:21,359
beautifully even with very small

1028
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:23,880
instances so the information for that

1029
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:29,400
machine tells us the security groups

1030
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:33,180
that have been allocated and the groups

1031
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:36,060
the security groups are here which ones

1032
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:38,940
are allocated for that machine well we

1033
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:44,130
got the rule that says that we allow for

1034
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:46,990
connection to port 22 from this IP so

1035
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:50,740
this machine

1036
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:52,899
we copy the IP we try to access it a

1037
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:56,080
machine by the way that works with

1038
01:02:52,900 --> 01:03:01,840
Apache so there's no rule that allows us

1039
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:03,940
to access through ports 8800 thinking

1040
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,450
and thinking and then it doesn't let us

1041
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:08,260
do it

1042
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:14,589
but if I get a rule and say I want you

1043
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:17,820
to enable port 80 for this IP you can

1044
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:22,540
say for a particular pipey or for

1045
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:24,910
identifier of security groups there

1046
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:27,070
could be a description this is a new

1047
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:28,839
field which is very useful because in

1048
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:30,070
the past you had to try and remember

1049
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:33,970
what you've done

1050
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:42,070
and how that description field is very

1051
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:45,069
useful and this is these rules work in

1052
01:03:42,070 --> 01:03:50,770
hot mode let's see if it lets me do it

1053
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:55,840
let me try again the tab seems to have

1054
01:03:50,770 --> 01:04:00,960
blocked ah it won't do it what is the

1055
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,960
mistake here I must have made a mistake

1056
01:04:03,269 --> 01:04:08,279
I'm going to restart the machine and see

1057
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:09,989
if that works I was using it this

1058
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:12,209
morning I was doing some work this

1059
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:12,719
morning we'll come back to that in a

1060
01:04:12,209 --> 01:04:17,279
minute

1061
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:23,719
but I was saying the permit is works in

1062
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:28,439
hot mode hot application it should work

1063
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:33,239
immediately as soon as you apply it it

1064
01:04:28,439 --> 01:04:36,058
hasn't but it should let me just try it

1065
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:37,829
again otherwise I'll just give off and

1066
01:04:36,059 --> 01:04:43,259
you'll just have to take my word for it

1067
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:46,499
ah it won't do it maybe because we have

1068
01:04:43,259 --> 01:04:48,149
a lot of different gadgets working here

1069
01:04:46,499 --> 01:04:54,089
at the same time maybe it's not getting

1070
01:04:48,149 --> 01:04:57,569
the IP properly no idea this is the ami

1071
01:04:54,089 --> 01:05:02,009
that was used well we have more details

1072
01:04:57,569 --> 01:05:04,829
but I want to show you this that's the

1073
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:07,619
name of the key that was used to make

1074
01:05:04,829 --> 01:05:11,639
this machine go life if I wanted to

1075
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:13,979
connect through SSH port 20 I should use

1076
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:18,149
this key and where is that key well I

1077
01:05:13,979 --> 01:05:21,239
have it the system has the public key

1078
01:05:18,149 --> 01:05:25,699
that the Machine needs and the private

1079
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:25,699
key who has it well I I do

1080
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:39,069
so every instance working has a volume

1081
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:42,849
an EBS volume associated where all the

1082
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:45,270
information in information is on the

1083
01:05:42,849 --> 01:05:47,710
hard drive this is eight gigas

1084
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:52,470
associated to that machine you see and

1085
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:57,250
then you have a snapshot security copies

1086
01:05:52,470 --> 01:06:00,069
which is an important starting point if

1087
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:01,930
we want to encrypt that volume for

1088
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:06,369
instance this one here has not been

1089
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:09,160
encrypted but if I say copy you see then

1090
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:12,700
I see the option for encrypting to be

1091
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:19,808
done it gives me a it asks me for a KMS

1092
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:24,098
key for me to use for this hard drive

1093
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:26,829
and then i could work with it with

1094
01:06:24,099 --> 01:06:30,430
information or will encrypt it this is

1095
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:32,799
the manager for the life cycle because

1096
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:36,299
in an infrastructure with machines and

1097
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:44,079
hard drives you should have a good

1098
01:06:36,299 --> 01:06:48,520
backup policy what that means is that

1099
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:52,420
you can have your backup one plan you

1100
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:55,480
can specify which areas should be

1101
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:58,000
covered by your backup and that's why

1102
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:01,539
tags I said earlier those descriptions

1103
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:04,990
are very useful you see this machine it

1104
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:08,140
has gone live and you can see there some

1105
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:10,839
tags this is an Ubuntu machine and I've

1106
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:14,049
specified it belongs to the development

1107
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:16,299
area that is connected with the security

1108
01:07:14,049 --> 01:07:19,660
department and thanks to that I can

1109
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:24,609
identify resources that I've tagged

1110
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:28,930
correctly in my job I do tagging all the

1111
01:07:24,609 --> 01:07:31,750
time tagging is basic because that's so

1112
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:35,140
helpful for invoicing finding

1113
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:37,370
vulnerabilities all sorts

1114
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:41,629
for instance in the development

1115
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:44,450
environment I can say here to do backups

1116
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:47,720
of everything I don't need to specify

1117
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:51,220
each machine one at a time and then I

1118
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:52,790
can say well do the backup with this

1119
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:57,109
frequency

1120
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:59,150
how many backups need to be saved I can

1121
01:07:57,110 --> 01:08:02,690
ask for it to copy the tags that's

1122
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:07,850
recommended and even add whatever tags

1123
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:10,160
we need now there are other settings and

1124
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:13,089
configuration options but they're not so

1125
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:20,210
applicable for what we're discussing now

1126
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:22,910
so all very interesting options so what

1127
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:26,770
are the security recommendations for

1128
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:32,240
what we've covered you should be using

1129
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:35,930
encrypted volumes addressed you should

1130
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:41,660
always encrypt then your machines force

1131
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:46,580
from HTTPS channels if you can do 443

1132
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:48,920
don't do 80 as a pause you should also

1133
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:52,130
review security groups that are

1134
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:54,770
associated to your machines why because

1135
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:58,310
that's the gateway for people to come in

1136
01:08:54,770 --> 01:09:00,410
don't say oh I'm going to open port 22

1137
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:03,350
from home and then you forget you

1138
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:08,528
tonight don't make sure that security

1139
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:14,470
groups are well supervised implement a

1140
01:09:08,529 --> 01:09:20,600
backup copy and AMI whatever you need

1141
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:24,319
generate an MI and AMI that's right for

1142
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:30,220
you because very often people set it all

1143
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:34,130
up and forget about generating the ami

1144
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:37,250
big mistake those machines that are on

1145
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:40,930
the internet in public Wi-Fi networks

1146
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:44,319
then you should always configure 8 the

1147
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:47,069
WAF firewall with different applications

1148
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,290
that Amazon provides and

1149
01:09:47,069 --> 01:09:55,139
quite interesting and just like I said

1150
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:58,199
earlier for the main account that you

1151
01:09:55,139 --> 01:10:01,650
need to create your first a admin user

1152
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:05,250
well in this case you should also have

1153
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:08,820
that as well to generate your users that

1154
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:12,420
you need but make sure that your master

1155
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:15,049
key is always well controlled under

1156
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,050
control

1157
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:24,389
you can't rotate the key and you have

1158
01:10:21,619 --> 01:10:27,780
you would otherwise make the process

1159
01:10:24,389 --> 01:10:33,530
much harder if you needed that process

1160
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:37,280
so keep it separate now in the container

1161
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:40,019
services we're just going to see the RDS

1162
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,599
services unfortunately we have no time

1163
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:45,960
to look at the database with all the

1164
01:10:42,599 --> 01:10:48,739
config options and settings but I would

1165
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:55,380
like to tell you a little bit about

1166
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:58,199
security the RDS database here we're

1167
01:10:55,380 --> 01:11:04,159
talking about a service that you can use

1168
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:10,549
and administrate as from a higher level

1169
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:19,348
the database engines are Aurora a Oracle

1170
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:22,320
Microsoft a SQL SLB so we can have a

1171
01:11:19,349 --> 01:11:26,280
database and make sure that all

1172
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:28,679
information is encrypted from this from

1173
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,349
the very beginning you start your

1174
01:11:28,679 --> 01:11:33,470
database and

1175
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:36,200
you get the check on and I'm not saying

1176
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:38,360
that all the information on the tables

1177
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:42,410
will be encrypted I'm just saying that

1178
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:46,730
the database will be part of an

1179
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:48,860
encrypted hard drive and this is a

1180
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:53,169
little bit like we said four instances

1181
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:58,670
earlier a database when you create it

1182
01:11:53,170 --> 01:12:00,490
with encrypted information well let's

1183
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:03,350
start and think that is not encrypted

1184
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:08,599
what should we do we should first take a

1185
01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:11,150
snapshot a copy it encrypted erase the

1186
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:16,690
original database and then we would have

1187
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:16,690
our new database with a encrypted data

1188
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:26,060
to connect with databases but we've seen

1189
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:29,019
what happens with data at rest but you

1190
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:32,000
can also connect to the database with

1191
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:35,750
information in transit and we want that

1192
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:38,450
to be secure as well unfortunately we

1193
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:42,710
have no time to look at each and every

1194
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:44,840
line I can give you a copy of my

1195
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:47,930
presentation later for you to see the

1196
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:54,500
details later so the idea is that for us

1197
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:59,950
to connect to Aurora or SQL what we

1198
01:12:54,500 --> 01:13:02,870
should do is that before the 5.7 release

1199
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:06,490
the connection mode was different you

1200
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:06,490
need to bear that in mind

1201
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:19,440
we also have a special

1202
01:13:16,739 --> 01:13:22,309
which is forcing the SSL connection you

1203
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:25,650
need to set that one

1204
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:30,590
Maria DB works more or less the same as

1205
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:35,009
we saw earlier for the SQL one Oracle

1206
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:38,820
works exactly the same as what we saw

1207
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:41,310
for sorry the speaker corrected himself

1208
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:45,420
in fact here there is an option that

1209
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:47,550
allows to enable the SSL the SQL Server

1210
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:50,070
is a parameter you need a parameter

1211
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:54,930
which is one and as soon as the you do

1212
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:56,790
that then it works fine so let's have a

1213
01:13:54,930 --> 01:14:12,570
look at the databases here on my

1214
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:15,060
dashboard I just want to show you the

1215
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:18,170
parameters that you need to comply with

1216
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:23,700
for security purpose let me just get an

1217
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:25,200
SQL and a my SQL one in this case I'm

1218
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:29,190
going to say the environment is

1219
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:31,769
development you need to enter all sorts

1220
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:36,690
of parameters for the type of release

1221
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:42,210
the instance look at that list of

1222
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:45,660
machines 300 and almost 400 gigas of ram

1223
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:48,150
memory this is what we saw earlier for

1224
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:50,969
availability areas you can set up a

1225
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:54,179
database for to availability areas just

1226
01:14:50,969 --> 01:14:58,050
in case one fails and then the other one

1227
01:14:54,180 --> 01:15:01,710
will work if we say no here then it says

1228
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:04,440
the cost says will be around $15 a month

1229
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:07,710
but if we say yes for high availability

1230
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:09,929
that means that I have access to two

1231
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:14,280
databases and that means the price is

1232
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:18,570
twice as high you can specify the hard

1233
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:20,580
disk and space and anyway there are lots

1234
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:20,880
of details there we have no time for

1235
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:24,680
that

1236
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,680
I'm not going to create one

1237
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:29,989
let me just fill this in just quickly

1238
01:15:27,409 --> 01:15:33,650
that is because what I really want to

1239
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:36,829
show you is the next screen here it asks

1240
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:40,098
you what VP CT you want one we've

1241
01:15:36,829 --> 01:15:42,409
created one earlier good the subnet type

1242
01:15:40,099 --> 01:15:47,570
if we want it to be public or not

1243
01:15:42,409 --> 01:15:51,348
because a database can be set up for it

1244
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:52,280
not to be accessible publicly only from

1245
01:15:51,349 --> 01:15:56,480
my V PC

1246
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:59,090
I can access it here you are locate safe

1247
01:15:56,480 --> 01:16:04,250
security groups different parameters

1248
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:07,060
here oh dear this machine is so small

1249
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:09,829
that it doesn't allow for encryption

1250
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:12,829
which is what I wanted to show you but

1251
01:16:09,829 --> 01:16:15,469
take my word for it here you can decide

1252
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:17,840
if you want the database to be encrypted

1253
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:21,579
from the very beginning here

1254
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:25,040
configuration for the back-up plan when

1255
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:26,900
it needs to happen what type of

1256
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:29,929
monitoring you want for your database

1257
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:32,659
because there's the basic level and the

1258
01:16:29,929 --> 01:16:36,760
advanced level at different costs

1259
01:16:32,659 --> 01:16:41,570
logically and here the area for log

1260
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:44,750
export which is quite new and that means

1261
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:47,869
that you can have all the logs from a

1262
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:51,020
database in the past the logs were there

1263
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:54,320
but because this service is now on

1264
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:58,040
Amazon there's access to the logs now

1265
01:16:54,320 --> 01:17:01,130
which is quite nice about maintenance

1266
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:04,909
you to say when the updates should be

1267
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:12,949
done how to protect the database against

1268
01:17:04,909 --> 01:17:17,750
accidental arrays catastrophes so you

1269
01:17:12,949 --> 01:17:20,719
can see this is quite syrup to protect

1270
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:23,900
from different problems here we have the

1271
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:25,560
tab for snapshots which is like the

1272
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:29,009
backup

1273
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:31,830
which the snapshot is done by default

1274
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:34,170
once a day and then you can do more when

1275
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:37,040
and if you need it

1276
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:41,010
I think that's probably enough for

1277
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:43,860
databases but please remember that the

1278
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:45,390
details there for the databases it's a

1279
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:52,139
little bit like we saw earlier for

1280
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:56,610
instances sorry I made a mistake here

1281
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:58,890
I'm on the snapshot area now that was

1282
01:17:56,610 --> 01:18:01,549
the mistake this is where you can see if

1283
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:04,920
it's been encrypted or not and

1284
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:08,130
connectivity here gives us access to the

1285
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:12,780
security group that the database belongs

1286
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:16,980
to you just click here and it's like we

1287
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:22,139
saw earlier for instances it says that

1288
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:26,400
the port is open for the IP you specify

1289
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:30,300
for instance so what are my basic

1290
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:34,009
security recommendations for databases

1291
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:37,950
in this case well you should always use

1292
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:41,540
databases with the hard drive encrypted

1293
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:44,160
at rest you should always deactivate

1294
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:46,620
alternatives make sure the connection is

1295
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:50,190
always through encrypted channels you

1296
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:53,240
need to review associated security

1297
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:56,400
groups you should have your backup

1298
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:59,280
policy adapted to what you need and

1299
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:02,519
unless you really really need is your

1300
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:04,920
database the basis should be privacy if

1301
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:06,900
you need somebody to connect from

1302
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:09,480
outside then they would need to be

1303
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:11,450
public access but even so you should

1304
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:14,490
have a security group that's very

1305
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:16,150
restricted at the level of the machine

1306
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:19,570
for instance

1307
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:23,889
you should also use the root user to

1308
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:28,030
create users other users and not to

1309
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:30,610
connect and gin generically generally

1310
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:33,580
speaking you should also have different

1311
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:36,339
users for different uses of your

1312
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:42,190
databases and permits need to be given

1313
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:46,239
at the level of draft field as specific

1314
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:49,239
as possible with permits so finally

1315
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:52,659
before we start seeing more specific

1316
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:55,989
services for security I want to talk a

1317
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:59,830
little bit about s3 services that means

1318
01:19:55,989 --> 01:20:03,790
that Amazon has unlimited storage space

1319
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:08,559
for information EBS are kept on as three

1320
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:12,070
logs are saved on s3 all that storage of

1321
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:15,790
information takes place at the s3 level

1322
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:20,889
so when we're talking about large

1323
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:25,409
volumes of information or databases with

1324
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:29,170
associated space the SS s3 is there

1325
01:20:25,409 --> 01:20:32,349
you're being charged for it even if you

1326
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:37,090
don't see it as a user it's been

1327
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:39,219
designed to have almost 100% durability

1328
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:44,020
so for those of you who don't know about

1329
01:20:39,219 --> 01:20:48,270
s3 all it is is a gigantic folder where

1330
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:52,000
you can just drop basically anything and

1331
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:55,600
then information is copied a at the

1332
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:58,750
different availability regions although

1333
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:03,460
you can also tell it not to apart from

1334
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:06,270
storing information and backups is also

1335
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:09,159
used for logs and for security

1336
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:11,699
information that you get from your

1337
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:11,699
services

1338
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:17,920
new processes that work with big data

1339
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:30,760
and also it's very useful to retrieve

1340
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:37,150
information in cases of emergency or

1341
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:41,050
contingency plans for corporates backups

1342
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:44,980
it's not on tape anymore it can now be

1343
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:48,770
stored on s3 at a very reasonable price

1344
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:53,480
here in bold print I say that buckets

1345
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:56,840
which is where you keep your things in

1346
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:59,209
folders so those buckets those basic

1347
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:05,360
units are safe and secure

1348
01:21:59,210 --> 01:22:07,489
by default so you have a new bucket and

1349
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:10,699
you you're the only one who can access

1350
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:15,110
it unless you specifically give somebody

1351
01:22:10,699 --> 01:22:18,530
else access when you give access to

1352
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:21,860
pockets those permits it can be done in

1353
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:24,800
three different ways one giving a policy

1354
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:27,559
to a user applying a policy to a user

1355
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:32,090
and saying hey this guy can access this

1356
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:36,619
bus a bucket to do these tasks then

1357
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:41,330
within the pocket you can also allocate

1358
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:43,759
a policy and say this bucket can be

1359
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:47,330
accessed by these people for these roles

1360
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:50,210
and in these conditions so if you say in

1361
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:52,969
this bucket nobody is going to be able

1362
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:57,949
to access it even if you've given a user

1363
01:22:52,969 --> 01:23:00,619
a permit because default is always sorry

1364
01:22:57,949 --> 01:23:03,280
denial is always there by default then

1365
01:23:00,619 --> 01:23:06,530
the user wouldn't be able to access it

1366
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:11,150
this is a typical policy for a bucket

1367
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:15,080
for instance whoever comes if the

1368
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:19,209
request doesn't come through HTTP then

1369
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:23,439
don't allow them to gain access

1370
01:23:19,209 --> 01:23:25,449
any connection attempts that doesn't go

1371
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:28,059
through an encrypted channel the wood

1372
01:23:25,449 --> 01:23:32,110
will then be denied another way to

1373
01:23:28,059 --> 01:23:35,409
indicate a permeate air for buckets

1374
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:38,978
was in fact this third one was the first

1375
01:23:35,409 --> 01:23:44,650
one that was ever given you know the

1376
01:23:38,979 --> 01:23:47,979
access lists that old idea but applied

1377
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:50,499
now to pockets that's what was done to

1378
01:23:47,979 --> 01:23:52,679
start off with but because policies are

1379
01:23:50,499 --> 01:23:55,539
much better really unsophisticated

1380
01:23:52,679 --> 01:24:00,159
really the third option really I

1381
01:23:55,539 --> 01:24:03,400
recommend you not to use it this is the

1382
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:06,999
same diagram we saw earlier as a

1383
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:10,900
reminder that deny policies always beat

1384
01:24:06,999 --> 01:24:14,199
the allow policies by definition what

1385
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:17,199
about interesting properties that we

1386
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:27,570
might come up with when we play with

1387
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:27,570
pockets we can enable the versions or

1388
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:40,110
that policy why is this interesting

1389
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:50,679
because if you find some things wrong

1390
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:56,320
and you think I need to go to a previous

1391
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:58,900
release you have a drop-down menu with a

1392
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:01,360
list of different releases and versions

1393
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:07,360
for that particular object and then you

1394
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:10,630
can decide which one you need so here it

1395
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:14,230
says server well really what we can

1396
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:18,150
activate is the access to the bucket

1397
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:23,230
meaning that every access will be

1398
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:25,809
recorded and then we can also do the

1399
01:25:23,230 --> 01:25:28,959
same thing but at the level of objects

1400
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:31,240
we can save logs every time as somebody

1401
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:34,930
touches a pocket or also somebody it

1402
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:37,980
every time save the object every time

1403
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:40,990
somebody touches the pockets with

1404
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:42,839
predetermined encryption any file error

1405
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:47,530
goes into the pocket air will

1406
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:48,970
automatically be encrypted this is

1407
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:51,910
really interesting as well we can also

1408
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:54,850
generate events what is that something

1409
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:57,340
that will run when something else

1410
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:59,680
happens for instance every time somebody

1411
01:25:57,340 --> 01:26:01,840
drops a file into the pocket I want you

1412
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,810
to send me an email or I want you to run

1413
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:08,950
a process or I want a machine to go live

1414
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:13,180
and do whatever on that file that has

1415
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:16,670
been dropped here his great you can then

1416
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:18,910
automate all sorts of tasks

1417
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:22,850
[Music]

1418
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:25,970
I'm doing really badly for time I didn't

1419
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:30,290
bring you an s3 demo because to be

1420
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:32,780
honest is not that interesting but I do

1421
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:35,780
want to at least very very quickly show

1422
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:38,360
you well unless I've erased it then I

1423
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:42,170
can't show you logically out here it is

1424
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:48,139
a fire in a pocket a with versions

1425
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:50,900
activated so this tab allows us to

1426
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:54,050
select at the version that I want for

1427
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:56,900
that particular fire which is very

1428
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:59,150
useful because if you're working in an

1429
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:01,639
environment where you're over writing

1430
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:10,309
all the time then this is terribly

1431
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:13,010
useful very practical so my security

1432
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:15,080
recommendations for s3 are the following

1433
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:18,550
you need to have your own policies at

1434
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:26,570
the level of users or resources avoid

1435
01:27:18,550 --> 01:27:28,730
ACLs and then force the policy for

1436
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:33,170
communication to always work through

1437
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:35,179
HTTPS is ever so simple can be done very

1438
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:38,060
simply you should also activate by

1439
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:40,700
default the encryption of all

1440
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:45,130
information in pockets you should also

1441
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:48,380
check and see if your products need a

1442
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:50,600
needed to use the versions sometimes you

1443
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:56,240
will sometimes it won't you should also

1444
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:58,430
have your policy for reviews because

1445
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:00,590
most of the information that saved in

1446
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:03,320
pockets is there because it's important

1447
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:05,450
right so we should always have policies

1448
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:09,170
for those buckets always under control

1449
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:12,019
and if you need to distribute objects in

1450
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:14,690
a bucket where you distribute static

1451
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:18,560
contray contains two files or whatever

1452
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:21,259
you need to configure a cloud front what

1453
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:24,170
is that a distribution platform with

1454
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:26,330
many different cached objects for

1455
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:29,270
different locations so that when you

1456
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:32,120
want to download an object a song

1457
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:36,230
ever it will happen much more quickly

1458
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:38,599
and why do you want a CloudFront

1459
01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:43,240
well because it improves the performance

1460
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:45,950
and because you can also associate a WAF

1461
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:50,510
we will see more about that in a minute

1462
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:52,280
and you will understand why yes and as I

1463
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:55,880
was saying so far there's been the

1464
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:58,580
summary of processing or computing

1465
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:00,890
services on Amazon for which we've seen

1466
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:04,280
security recommendations so that we can

1467
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:07,850
use and safely and securely from here

1468
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:11,330
onwards the last model will be security

1469
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:18,950
services offered by Amazon first one is

1470
01:29:11,330 --> 01:29:21,440
cloud trail cloud trail well that's the

1471
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:23,870
feature of perma Amazon to keep under

1472
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:28,339
control every log is the locks are

1473
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:30,920
produced by the API which is the basis

1474
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:33,770
of Amazon's so these are calls to the

1475
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:36,710
API and every column the API will

1476
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:40,460
produce a log plough trail is the one

1477
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:42,950
that records all those logs and then

1478
01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:47,750
shows them to us and gives us access to

1479
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:50,720
what we have so basically it works like

1480
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:54,530
this cloud trail records logs and store

1481
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:58,090
them based on what we want it to do it

1482
01:29:54,530 --> 01:30:00,429
will follow different measures or act

1483
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:03,580
and so

1484
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:07,030
it will give us some auditing skills or

1485
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:10,800
features so that we can see different

1486
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:10,800
conditions our rules

1487
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:28,360
let's see in a minute huh

1488
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:30,970
what it is like car clout train I say it

1489
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:33,490
can be on or off when I say it's on it

1490
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:37,150
means that on our dashboard will seem

1491
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:39,519
for amazone the activity within the last

1492
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:41,920
90 days even if we do nothing about it

1493
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:43,570
if there is an event that I want to know

1494
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,550
what happened three days ago the

1495
01:30:43,570 --> 01:30:48,849
information I have it with me problem is

1496
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:50,830
that is only 90 days some people might

1497
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:52,630
think it's too long but for some project

1498
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:55,330
might not even begin to cover it

1499
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:58,750
so we want much more we need to build a

1500
01:30:55,330 --> 01:31:00,760
trail the trail well basically you give

1501
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:02,560
it a name and you can decide whether you

1502
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:04,510
want it just for the region you're in or

1503
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:06,520
for every region maybe you're interested

1504
01:31:04,510 --> 01:31:09,820
in having several trails for every

1505
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:12,040
region you also need to indicate what

1506
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:14,320
kind of events you want it to stroll you

1507
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:18,610
can select if you want them all on the

1508
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:22,360
read only or write only you can also say

1509
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:25,299
that it needs to store extra information

1510
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:27,910
for s3 services and London London we

1511
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:30,460
will not discuss it here but it is the

1512
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:34,570
server less computing service with

1513
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:36,730
Amazon where you can run batches of code

1514
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:40,620
no more than two minutes long in a very

1515
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:43,179
simple way and it is amazing again

1516
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:45,940
mind-blowing it allows you to do so many

1517
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:50,170
things without servers you can nest

1518
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:55,120
things in and mud and wonderful so

1519
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:58,300
London and s3 and you can choose it if

1520
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:59,890
you wish you can choose the bucket for

1521
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:01,540
s3 where you want to give the

1522
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:04,060
information because in the end you will

1523
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:06,250
be saving lots of information Amazon

1524
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:07,930
wants to pay for it so you can better in

1525
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:10,330
your bucket and you pay for the space

1526
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:13,330
used when I say lots of information it's

1527
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:15,790
truly lots of information for

1528
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:18,430
s3 it's not that much if you turn this

1529
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:22,560
on the cost will not go up that much

1530
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:25,060
it's not like that it s3 storage is very

1531
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:29,950
cheap and no problem there so when you

1532
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:33,100
build a trail you could access item

1533
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:35,920
created here because what happens it's

1534
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:37,390
the same as here but instead of 91 more

1535
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:39,700
days since we've got this one I'll show

1536
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:41,650
it to you here you have a screen or a

1537
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:44,710
display where you can check everything

1538
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:46,540
this happened everything this happened

1539
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:52,870
you say it here just a minute ago it

1540
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:56,560
says here that from Island that's where

1541
01:32:52,870 --> 01:33:00,340
we are now the root user I told you not

1542
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:03,490
to use it but for the demos I didn't

1543
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:06,370
have the time to create an admin so do

1544
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:09,610
as I tell and not as I show so the road

1545
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:14,950
user here from this up here and this is

1546
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:18,639
the gap of time with authorized security

1547
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:20,740
group ingress that's when I authorize

1548
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:23,410
port 80 for the Machine I would say and

1549
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:24,700
if you want to see the details you don't

1550
01:33:23,410 --> 01:33:27,340
need to remember because you can see

1551
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:34,690
that right away all that information you

1552
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:37,000
have it in Jason and with an APA I

1553
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:39,099
called you can download it and then try

1554
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,890
to set up all these scenarios you might

1555
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:44,920
think of here it says there was a time

1556
01:33:41,890 --> 01:33:47,830
where you actually authorized port 84

1557
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:50,080
this i-beam I know it was you I know it

1558
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:52,720
was a while ago and this is all

1559
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:56,700
information that is very interesting

1560
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:56,700
from the point of view of an audit just

1561
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:02,320
to give you an example yes a few years

1562
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:07,180
eight years ago we were working on all

1563
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:09,250
of the sudden we were sending a script

1564
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:11,830
but it seems that the bucket for this

1565
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:14,080
trip was missing someone had deleted it

1566
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:16,720
no problem because it was a development

1567
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:19,080
bucket but all of the sudden there was

1568
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:21,640
one bucket that was missing

1569
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:24,780
first it is a security problem he's

1570
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:24,780
deleted in my bucket

1571
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:29,540
but maybe it's not that there is an

1572
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:31,759
intuition maybe there is a process that

1573
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:35,840
is misfiring and you need to know what's

1574
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:38,420
going on so you come here and okay you

1575
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:44,300
can filter and say I just want to get

1576
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:50,420
the events that are I know where's the

1577
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:53,270
bucket everything having to do with

1578
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:55,430
bucket all those items that where bucket

1579
01:34:53,270 --> 01:35:01,130
related and last night so you can get a

1580
01:34:55,430 --> 01:35:03,340
list and say okay just like this we

1581
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:08,540
learned the problem was that a user had

1582
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:12,820
an advert Italy deleted so we removed

1583
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:12,820
the permit from and that was it

1584
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:33,160
so cloud tray straws all this

1585
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:36,100
information here but then all that

1586
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:39,630
information you can move to other tools

1587
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:43,870
that will allow you for other kinds of

1588
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:46,210
more accurate searches so I said that

1589
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:50,080
any of these events if you come here you

1590
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:52,060
can see it as Jason so you can upload

1591
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:54,820
this to other kind of tools and you can

1592
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:56,440
such as you wish on this specific

1593
01:35:54,820 --> 01:36:00,130
dashboard as you say that's not possible

1594
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:02,919
you need to go in deeper but if you need

1595
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:06,280
something a bit more specific you have

1596
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:08,110
all the chances to import it into a

1597
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:12,670
different platform where you can perform

1598
01:36:08,110 --> 01:36:15,160
searches as document so move it on

1599
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:25,410
elastic search and search for whatever

1600
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:28,559
you want con respecto I recommend a few

1601
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:35,349
security recommendations for quatrain

1602
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:38,200
turn it on so it's a 90 day storage

1603
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:41,950
sometimes that might not be enough and

1604
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:43,660
the cost of it is nothing nothing

1605
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:47,740
compared to what you are setting up on

1606
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:51,130
Amazon turn on the login for everything

1607
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:54,160
reading and writing also s3 and London

1608
01:36:51,130 --> 01:36:57,670
this side we saw for setup so clicking

1609
01:36:54,160 --> 01:37:00,550
old a bucket for all the files turn on

1610
01:36:57,670 --> 01:37:04,930
the default encryption you didn't see

1611
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:07,530
this but if you go to trail of

1612
01:37:04,930 --> 01:37:10,510
securities this is advanced and that

1613
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:14,099
gives you the chance to encrypt all the

1614
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:16,680
information that you have it so do

1615
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:19,330
encrypt that information as well and

1616
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:23,770
then you will end up with the set of

1617
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:26,530
data that it will be very useful for a

1618
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:30,400
large project where you need to keep

1619
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:33,090
tight control of security flat watch

1620
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:36,940
next flat watch

1621
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:39,880
that's the size that stores different

1622
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:42,790
things I find it is a mixture of so many

1623
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:45,489
things but basically will allow us to

1624
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:48,400
monitor and manage all the information

1625
01:37:45,489 --> 01:37:51,040
that we will get from all other sides we

1626
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:54,190
can just clock watch to define alarm

1627
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:56,739
saying if this happens do this we can

1628
01:37:54,190 --> 01:38:00,160
check blogs and metrics and everything

1629
01:37:56,739 --> 01:38:02,860
it is quite simple uncluttered watch we

1630
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:04,480
can send there or collect things from

1631
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:07,420
there it will monitor it all and

1632
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:11,379
basically what it finds it will take

1633
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:20,410
different actions let's see if this one

1634
01:38:11,380 --> 01:38:26,860
here flat watch plot watch well we could

1635
01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:29,559
use 4 hours to explain it a pretty

1636
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:32,320
powerful dashboard being a master in

1637
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:34,750
fact watch it take some time but I

1638
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:38,559
assure you that when you know how to use

1639
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:41,500
it you can do everything with it you can

1640
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:44,580
have great control over your systems and

1641
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,580
automate so many things

1642
01:38:54,770 --> 01:39:01,220
you can create a lock on the cloud watch

1643
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:03,860
and throw there anyone you want there's

1644
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:06,140
a London's feature here you have it you

1645
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:08,360
can create events do whatever you want

1646
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:12,890
you can send it there you can also set

1647
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:16,490
up alarms and then alarm what it says is

1648
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:20,140
if this condition is met do this so

1649
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:23,809
let's say that we will create an alarm

1650
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:26,840
to monitor our machine the one that is

1651
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:30,980
being developed and we say well that

1652
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:33,710
machine so these are the scores that we

1653
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:37,160
can check right and so we would be

1654
01:39:33,710 --> 01:39:41,450
interested in learning about the cpu

1655
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:43,690
rate so check my cpu rate for this

1656
01:39:41,450 --> 01:39:47,540
machine and here

1657
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:52,460
we restarted it and that's why we have a

1658
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:55,160
you speak and so I want you that is the

1659
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:57,740
machine are there the program to see the

1660
01:39:55,160 --> 01:40:02,780
CPU years or a rate and there's this

1661
01:39:57,740 --> 01:40:09,080
alarm where if the CPU use is greater or

1662
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:11,990
equal to 80 percent let's say four four

1663
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:14,180
five data points which is just a second

1664
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:18,559
if I am not mistaken I don't think it's

1665
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:21,200
a minute so if the use of CPU is over

1666
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,720
80% 4 / 5 minutes there's something

1667
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:25,429
going on it's not that it is wrong it

1668
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:27,200
might be good it's not bad it might be

1669
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:30,140
good it might be that there is a

1670
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:31,550
wonderful visitor Peggy now we're side

1671
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:34,190
and I'm where each cameras is little

1672
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:36,860
sign so much but we need to know maybe

1673
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:39,379
there's someone who's using a fours

1674
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:44,120
brute attack and we need to the

1675
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:48,320
brute-force attack on us so we need to

1676
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:50,960
understand that the CPU serve over 80 so

1677
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:53,389
80% used for over X minutes will be an

1678
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:56,240
alarm we can have a warning and say if

1679
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:59,060
this happens send an email to the

1680
01:40:56,240 --> 01:41:02,540
manager Administration and we can do

1681
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:04,190
things as nice as say let's improve the

1682
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:06,230
self scalation so you have a machine

1683
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:07,699
I'll guess that there's someone many

1684
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:09,860
people buying at your shop

1685
01:41:07,699 --> 01:41:12,530
so I'd get the Machine and get it and

1686
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:15,679
get a load balance and I will scale it I

1687
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:18,530
will balance the requests and make sure

1688
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:21,110
that automatically your machine that was

1689
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:24,620
not enough now it will be two machines

1690
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:26,719
that can endear that traffic and you

1691
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:29,150
might say okay when this happens with

1692
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:30,860
this machine which is on a subnet which

1693
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:32,480
is a private subnet and I know this

1694
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:35,089
problem should not happen there whatever

1695
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:37,759
one is that automatically you need to

1696
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:46,790
stop the machine or even delete it or

1697
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:50,300
reboot it so simple as that we can keep

1698
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:55,699
under control a parameter such as CPU

1699
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:58,940
rate or memory rate or drive right envy

1700
01:41:55,699 --> 01:42:04,610
so many scores and parameters that we

1701
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:08,509
can keep under control there are other

1702
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:15,920
events as well with rules but I'll show

1703
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:18,199
that ten minutes from now so forget

1704
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,790
about it for a minute and you will

1705
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:22,610
understand it easier later

1706
01:42:19,790 --> 01:42:24,980
this is rules if this happens do this

1707
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:30,670
it's not about scores but actions of any

1708
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:35,030
kind as you see this a bit of everything

1709
01:42:30,670 --> 01:42:37,640
alarms and everything so it's a

1710
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:39,050
dashboard that if you ask me it's a bit

1711
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:41,239
messy because there's lots of things

1712
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:50,239
mixed in here but it's a streamlet

1713
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:53,900
powerful security recommendations for

1714
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:56,080
cloud watch so get familiar with it it

1715
01:42:53,900 --> 01:43:01,040
will sort out so many of your problems

1716
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:03,860
but you need to use some time it is not

1717
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:06,320
that easy it's not super complicated but

1718
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:09,830
there are so many options and you need

1719
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:11,570
to use some time and keep it and keep

1720
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:13,940
familiar with it you need to see what's

1721
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:15,980
important for your resources and shows

1722
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:19,309
choose the scores and the metrics of

1723
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:20,718
this 180 of them we do not need to multi

1724
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:23,960
everything but some will be intro

1725
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:26,630
him set up the alarms based on the score

1726
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:28,869
some of them well you just warned them

1727
01:43:26,630 --> 01:43:32,150
to have an email for some others you say

1728
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:34,999
okay turn it off because someone's

1729
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:37,820
trying to crash it and also use events

1730
01:43:34,999 --> 01:43:44,030
to send actions to solve the bonus the

1731
01:43:37,820 --> 01:43:46,159
alerts this is another service which is

1732
01:43:44,030 --> 01:43:51,699
very interesting but I don't have much

1733
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:55,728
to say about it shield which is just a

1734
01:43:51,699 --> 01:43:56,960
defense against EOS attacks and why why

1735
01:43:55,729 --> 01:43:59,659
do I say there's not much to say about

1736
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:02,329
shield because it's very transparent for

1737
01:43:59,659 --> 01:44:04,429
the user amazon says don't you worry

1738
01:44:02,329 --> 01:44:08,268
I'll take care of it and that's it

1739
01:44:04,429 --> 01:44:11,059
alright so there are two types of set up

1740
01:44:08,269 --> 01:44:12,949
for shield the standard one that all

1741
01:44:11,059 --> 01:44:16,400
accounts have by default and then

1742
01:44:12,949 --> 01:44:19,009
advanced standard will only check

1743
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:23,449
everything that has to do with network

1744
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:26,960
monitoring but has as not a layer 7 but

1745
01:44:23,449 --> 01:44:31,669
the advanced one has and then there is

1746
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:34,309
the OS attacks that get halted unless

1747
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:36,229
it's too advanced if it's small it'll be

1748
01:44:34,309 --> 01:44:38,900
halted if you have an infrastructure

1749
01:44:36,229 --> 01:44:40,639
which is a larger company and you think

1750
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:43,280
the attacks are on you will be

1751
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:47,719
significant you need to go to the

1752
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:51,978
advanced version so the advanced model

1753
01:44:47,719 --> 01:44:56,409
is $3,000 a month plus would you sprint

1754
01:44:51,979 --> 01:44:59,179
after an attack so for a small account

1755
01:44:56,409 --> 01:45:01,549
not interesting you don't spit that much

1756
01:44:59,179 --> 01:45:03,229
not even on infrastructure but for a

1757
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:08,150
larger company is so very interesting

1758
01:45:03,229 --> 01:45:10,610
because first it get it there's security

1759
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:12,110
check ups which you don't get with the

1760
01:45:10,610 --> 01:45:14,239
standard one but there's something

1761
01:45:12,110 --> 01:45:16,369
wonderfully if you've actually got the

1762
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:19,039
advanced and there is an attack that has

1763
01:45:16,369 --> 01:45:21,710
been successful i'm missin' sends a guy

1764
01:45:19,039 --> 01:45:23,719
to your office and amazon security

1765
01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:27,639
expert sitting next to you and won't

1766
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:27,639
leave your side until it's all soft

1767
01:45:29,420 --> 01:45:33,960
you know it was an attack but you know

1768
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,860
they are so expensive that it's a money

1769
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,600
well invested

1770
01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:40,139
those three thousand dollars maybe you

1771
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:43,700
get the visit so I will not run a demo

1772
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:47,670
for shield girls shields top is the two

1773
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:48,389
shots that I showed I'm here I'm on it

1774
01:45:47,670 --> 01:45:51,660
by default

1775
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:58,590
don't you worry I'm in charge but

1776
01:45:51,660 --> 01:46:05,639
there's nothing you can see WAF

1777
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:09,300
Roughnecks is an app firewall it's a

1778
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:11,730
layer 7 great and it'll be in front of

1779
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:15,140
all the apps all the servers on the

1780
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:18,839
internet API and everything else and

1781
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:27,360
these will filter their requests based

1782
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:28,720
on the rules that we've defined these

1783
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:33,009
rules can be

1784
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:37,480
I'm from for defense against code

1785
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:41,050
injections trust site scripting you can

1786
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:46,330
also have known attack rules from war

1787
01:46:41,050 --> 01:46:51,040
prayers or others so what happens these

1788
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:54,100
were a drag the firewall rules are

1789
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:56,440
complicated to develop and setting up a

1790
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:59,290
waffle that has a true

1791
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:05,349
filtering of what you might get in is

1792
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:08,830
quite complex so we have managed rules a

1793
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:12,580
set of rules that manufacturers give you

1794
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:14,920
right away you download it and go live

1795
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:18,580
and everything all the rules are already

1796
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:24,750
armed we have regular manufacturers in

1797
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:26,680
the business world such F 549 and others

1798
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:35,260
how does it work

1799
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:37,600
basically if you come to waffle I create

1800
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:43,150
just before I came in because it takes

1801
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:46,090
some time to go live and so it's done

1802
01:47:43,150 --> 01:47:49,269
and this is what it looks like again you

1803
01:47:46,090 --> 01:47:51,160
can download the rules some come in a

1804
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:54,460
car some others are free of charge into

1805
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:56,410
it'll depend on what you have the rule

1806
01:47:54,460 --> 01:47:59,590
set that you trust the most Amazon gives

1807
01:47:56,410 --> 01:48:02,950
you the set of rules they defend you

1808
01:47:59,590 --> 01:48:09,940
from the ten most ordinary attacks so

1809
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:12,790
the Oh was top ten so you can see which

1810
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:15,070
ones are created well this is cloud from

1811
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:22,240
the solutions are known is found but

1812
01:48:15,070 --> 01:48:25,780
this is for Island but these something

1813
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:29,830
that I've done with a cloud from patent

1814
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:31,929
which is brave with Amazon you can have

1815
01:48:29,830 --> 01:48:35,200
infrastructure from Mac out so you can

1816
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:38,040
have a JSON file or Java file and you

1817
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:42,550
have this in protectors described here

1818
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:46,720
and then you say go live and all the

1819
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:48,390
services go live automatically and you

1820
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:52,030
can have that on your infrastructure

1821
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:53,380
version one Chi and you can go live with

1822
01:48:52,030 --> 01:48:57,340
different environments this is great

1823
01:48:53,380 --> 01:49:01,090
because you can start thousands of

1824
01:48:57,340 --> 01:49:05,530
resources this is something that Amazon

1825
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:12,550
gives you and I'll share it with you

1826
01:49:05,530 --> 01:49:13,699
when I give you the presentation since I

1827
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:16,579
don't have

1828
01:49:13,699 --> 01:49:18,409
a nap you can see no evidence of a

1829
01:49:16,579 --> 01:49:21,590
potential attack refer anything of the

1830
01:49:18,409 --> 01:49:24,440
kind but for the first tab you would see

1831
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:27,949
if there's an act any activity second

1832
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:35,119
one you see all the rules that we have

1833
01:49:27,949 --> 01:49:39,919
here on this woth for the whitelist and

1834
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:44,509
blacklist and also H a TP flit attacks

1835
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:49,099
and also masses can also reputations

1836
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:52,610
lists DSS SQL injection cross-site

1837
01:49:49,099 --> 01:49:58,099
scripting inside each of those what does

1838
01:49:52,610 --> 01:50:00,820
it a do SQL injection all this is

1839
01:49:58,099 --> 01:50:05,959
checked whether there is an attack on

1840
01:50:00,820 --> 01:50:11,959
the URL our else train call or anything

1841
01:50:05,959 --> 01:50:13,760
inside it so so many places where you'd

1842
01:50:11,959 --> 01:50:16,929
make sure there is no injection that we

1843
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,929
can have an impact on your server

1844
01:50:24,989 --> 01:50:31,809
you can also have logon generation wofe

1845
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:34,590
will get requests or queries if they do

1846
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:37,090
not meet the rules they will be cut out

1847
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:38,830
but we won the log of everything that

1848
01:50:37,090 --> 01:50:41,560
has been done so we can also send it to

1849
01:50:38,830 --> 01:50:46,480
an s3 bucket and manage it elsewhere and

1850
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:48,820
when you create a wofe down here you can

1851
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:51,940
add it to so many things you can have

1852
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:56,469
that one off for so many resources just

1853
01:50:51,940 --> 01:51:03,040
here what you say is if you want it on

1854
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:06,280
our load balancer or on an API since I

1855
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:10,840
don't have a load balancer created I can

1856
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:12,790
choose it but if you have 14 in the

1857
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:14,890
pipeline you can have a wife for both

1858
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:17,620
and this will be the one that will get

1859
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:21,820
the request and it is Amazon that will

1860
01:51:17,620 --> 01:51:23,800
scale is you don't need to see if it's

1861
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:26,170
coming from one machine or several

1862
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:30,880
machines if the woof needs to be

1863
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:33,610
escalated it'll be done by Amazon so

1864
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:42,040
very interesting as well and so whenever

1865
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:45,150
there is a load balancer at it oh sorry

1866
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:45,150
about this I forgot

1867
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:54,650
what security recommendations

1868
01:51:50,849 --> 01:51:58,710
you need to deployed it to cast again

1869
01:51:54,650 --> 01:52:02,670
very low the only bait for the rule set

1870
01:51:58,710 --> 01:52:07,769
usually it's for your amount a waffle no

1871
01:52:02,670 --> 01:52:10,999
money is it use it use it use the manage

1872
01:52:07,769 --> 01:52:13,769
rules as starting point do not set it up

1873
01:52:10,999 --> 01:52:15,780
download the rules rule said Amazon

1874
01:52:13,769 --> 01:52:17,909
gives you one free of charge you can

1875
01:52:15,780 --> 01:52:20,728
start with that and then you can create

1876
01:52:17,909 --> 01:52:23,129
the rules that you need a fine tea into

1877
01:52:20,729 --> 01:52:25,650
the needs of your project and I allocate

1878
01:52:23,130 --> 01:52:30,389
a hoie for every load balancer and their

1879
01:52:25,650 --> 01:52:31,440
distributions and we move on to

1880
01:52:30,389 --> 01:52:35,789
inspector which i think is the

1881
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:41,848
penultimate right inspector is another

1882
01:52:35,789 --> 01:52:44,699
security tool and it will help us see

1883
01:52:41,849 --> 01:52:49,530
the vulnerabilities in our machines if

1884
01:52:44,699 --> 01:52:57,119
you've ever used neces or similar tools

1885
01:52:49,530 --> 01:53:02,400
well this is Amazon's Nexus Nessus so

1886
01:52:57,119 --> 01:53:04,920
what was it five so I set up a fraud

1887
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:07,710
agent and you can run analysis it will

1888
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:09,749
classify evidence into high low and

1889
01:53:07,710 --> 01:53:12,179
medium and also for information as

1890
01:53:09,749 --> 01:53:15,360
around since we're short in time I will

1891
01:53:12,179 --> 01:53:17,249
skip the packets that aren't the basis

1892
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:27,570
of faith but you can set up several

1893
01:53:17,249 --> 01:53:30,809
scanning rules short of time so let's

1894
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:35,210
expedite this and skip to the last part

1895
01:53:30,809 --> 01:53:38,280
of it inspector

1896
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:42,599
you need to say what machines you will

1897
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:46,440
you be using it on and see what test

1898
01:53:42,599 --> 01:53:49,400
packets you wanna run and decide one you

1899
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:53,808
want to run it what does it do a

1900
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:56,150
findings list organized by priority so

1901
01:53:53,809 --> 01:54:00,440
you go in there

1902
01:53:56,150 --> 01:54:04,129
and it says well this is a machine I run

1903
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:06,019
the test with bunty that's the name of

1904
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:10,100
the machine and there is a high

1905
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:13,730
vulnerability on this machine which is

1906
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:18,080
CVA 2018 or what what you see on screen

1907
01:54:13,730 --> 01:54:20,120
and your curl setup is vulnerable as a

1908
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:22,820
version so it says what's your problem

1909
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:25,519
there and it explains how to solve it so

1910
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:27,500
you need to update this packet here this

1911
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:29,510
packet here in this packet here and with

1912
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:32,960
that you have these vulnerabilities

1913
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:35,420
solved interesting because you can set

1914
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:38,450
it up for all your machines and it runs

1915
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:41,770
every day if you wish or every second

1916
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:44,720
day every third day whatever you choose

1917
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:47,450
then you get a report you week you can

1918
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:50,120
download and forward it to a client for

1919
01:54:47,450 --> 01:54:52,370
example or give it in a history so it's

1920
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:54,230
an agent on every machine that you want

1921
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:55,849
to give under control and Amazon

1922
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:57,669
communicates with those people and

1923
01:54:55,850 --> 01:55:00,170
that's what you get

1924
01:54:57,670 --> 01:55:02,270
inspectors recommendation for the

1925
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:05,180
community Shore inspector so set it up

1926
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:06,770
for all your instances that are easy to

1927
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:09,650
use and you keep all the vulnerabilities

1928
01:55:06,770 --> 01:55:11,630
under control from a daily analysis at

1929
01:55:09,650 --> 01:55:14,030
least for those exposed to the Internet

1930
01:55:11,630 --> 01:55:17,540
set the frequency you need for every

1931
01:55:14,030 --> 01:55:21,920
other instance build the planters of

1932
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:24,230
high vulnerabilities also build an on

1933
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:27,890
such an urgent plan for other

1934
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:34,639
vulnerabilities and keep your instances

1935
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:40,040
as - today as you can next god did him

1936
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:46,300
quite recent and for those of us working

1937
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:46,300
on it we find it great a sip and weed

1938
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:53,030
god duty is Amazon's system monitoring

1939
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:56,000
everything going on on Amazon all the

1940
01:55:53,030 --> 01:56:01,059
documents produced by us by the API by

1941
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:04,190
s3 all of it all the of it going through

1942
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:07,130
them produced by Amazon it will be

1943
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:10,460
stored and checked by car deity not just

1944
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:13,400
for your information but it is based on

1945
01:56:10,460 --> 01:56:15,740
an artificial intelligence platform

1946
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:17,950
comparing evidences you've got and those

1947
01:56:15,740 --> 01:56:25,700
of other Amazon clients to find patterns

1948
01:56:17,950 --> 01:56:27,710
so the power is interesting I'd fly

1949
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:31,130
through that but I just need you to see

1950
01:56:27,710 --> 01:56:37,400
that it is based on the trail and VPC

1951
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:40,670
and DNS logs we didn't talk about the

1952
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:43,759
DNS manager that Amazon does but it

1953
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:46,070
generates logs as well I'm pretty sure

1954
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:48,290
you're going to like this and this is

1955
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:52,750
the cherry on the cake for us to finish

1956
01:56:48,290 --> 01:56:55,970
the presentation it's very simple but

1957
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:57,320
have a look at this example starting

1958
01:56:55,970 --> 01:57:00,950
with guard duty

1959
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:05,590
sending events to call out what and that

1960
01:57:00,950 --> 01:57:09,650
will send a message to the user and to a

1961
01:57:05,590 --> 01:57:11,450
genesis stream I'll tell you what that

1962
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:14,089
is in a minute that will save

1963
01:57:11,450 --> 01:57:17,059
information in a pocket that will be

1964
01:57:14,090 --> 01:57:19,970
sent as well to an elastic search so

1965
01:57:17,060 --> 01:57:23,140
that we can do really clever searches

1966
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:26,090
that we can have then on a qivana

1967
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:28,700
dashboard sounds complex but you can do

1968
01:57:26,090 --> 01:57:30,590
it all in just three clicks just with

1969
01:57:28,700 --> 01:57:35,720
three clicks and very interesting

1970
01:57:30,590 --> 01:57:37,979
outcomes I get excited you see but I

1971
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:42,219
just love this

1972
01:57:37,979 --> 01:57:44,739
guard duty is ever so simple you just

1973
01:57:42,219 --> 01:57:47,709
access it and what you have there a

1974
01:57:44,739 --> 01:57:50,138
button just one button so you enable it

1975
01:57:47,709 --> 01:57:52,590
you enable guard duty and your

1976
01:57:50,139 --> 01:57:56,229
intelligence system is checking

1977
01:57:52,590 --> 01:57:58,389
everything for us right now we have no

1978
01:57:56,229 --> 01:58:01,300
results but let's have a look at the

1979
01:57:58,389 --> 01:58:03,489
settings here with an option that says

1980
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:06,369
how often do you want to send

1981
01:58:03,489 --> 01:58:09,400
information generated by core duty I

1982
01:58:06,369 --> 01:58:13,209
tend to say 15 minutes there you can

1983
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:15,400
also generate sample results because

1984
01:58:13,209 --> 01:58:17,229
otherwise you might activate it and it

1985
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:19,780
might take three days for you to see

1986
01:58:17,229 --> 01:58:25,929
anything much then it has an option to

1987
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:28,809
either disable it or for it not to work

1988
01:58:25,929 --> 01:58:31,869
temporarily let's have a look at this

1989
01:58:28,809 --> 01:58:38,159
this is a false instance this is what it

1990
01:58:31,869 --> 01:58:44,289
says and on port 30 to 39 thousand AARP

1991
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:48,159
ma is a Linux machine with his IP on

1992
01:58:44,289 --> 01:58:51,369
this network well you get all sorts of

1993
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:54,518
details of where the attack could took

1994
01:58:51,369 --> 01:58:58,268
place and what was the result somebody

1995
01:58:54,519 --> 01:59:05,159
from this IP at this port located in

1996
01:58:58,269 --> 01:59:08,919
this particular city with this the

1997
01:59:05,159 --> 01:59:12,879
connection details that we have and it

1998
01:59:08,919 --> 01:59:16,389
connected a tried to connect to your

1999
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:20,590
machine probably with a brute-force

2000
01:59:16,389 --> 01:59:23,739
attack it's amazing all the details it

2001
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:28,929
gives you for this connection the system

2002
01:59:23,739 --> 01:59:33,299
considers is not legit but tried to

2003
01:59:28,929 --> 01:59:33,300
connect when it shouldn't then

2004
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:42,160
what you can do then is for this to then

2005
01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:47,110
go to cloud watch because god card duty

2006
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:51,010
has that option and you then generate

2007
01:59:47,110 --> 01:59:55,179
that rule on from car duty you have this

2008
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:58,930
rule you see it says every time the car

2009
01:59:55,180 --> 02:00:01,780
Duty surface generates a finding event

2010
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:07,540
every time you find something what will

2011
02:00:01,780 --> 02:00:12,460
happen is one an email will send will be

2012
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:14,680
sent by you through SNS to whoever you

2013
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:16,960
decide and then that chunk of

2014
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:21,160
information those details will also go

2015
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:24,910
to a stream for delivery or content

2016
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:27,099
delivery fire host is good so that it

2017
02:00:24,910 --> 02:00:31,210
can then be distributed wherever is

2018
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:34,540
required what is fire house do then just

2019
02:00:31,210 --> 02:00:43,240
very very quickly now let me show you

2020
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:46,000
this fire host gets the information ma

2021
02:00:43,240 --> 02:00:48,730
I'm not going to tell you how to do the

2022
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:52,330
option setting options for it to do

2023
02:00:48,730 --> 02:00:57,040
other things but and this is where you

2024
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:59,559
say I want the guard duty information to

2025
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:02,200
then go to elasticsearch which is a

2026
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:05,650
documentary database for very fast

2027
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:11,380
searches right so apart from having that

2028
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:16,330
endpoint for information it also runs

2029
02:01:11,380 --> 02:01:19,330
for a kavacha and point you see this is

2030
02:01:16,330 --> 02:01:21,940
it calling life you can define your

2031
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:26,230
dashboard then for you to view the

2032
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:29,589
information from guard duty so these are

2033
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:33,639
just examples for you to get an idea of

2034
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:35,970
how guard duty works basically it will

2035
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:40,380
tell you this instance with this

2036
02:01:35,970 --> 02:01:44,470
identifier has had different attacks

2037
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:47,080
trojans backdoor attacks something to do

2038
02:01:44,470 --> 02:01:51,070
with pentesting cryptocurrency

2039
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:52,660
fruit brute force on ports all sorts so

2040
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:57,610
you can click on the different colors

2041
02:01:52,660 --> 02:02:00,910
for details what else have we goes the

2042
02:01:57,610 --> 02:02:05,500
ten most common findings like your top

2043
02:02:00,910 --> 02:02:09,280
ten where connection attempts have been

2044
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:12,340
done to port which countries those

2045
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:17,170
attempts came from you can see how

2046
02:02:12,340 --> 02:02:21,340
severe the findings were high medium or

2047
02:02:17,170 --> 02:02:24,340
low severity or here you can filter and

2048
02:02:21,340 --> 02:02:26,860
just I just want to see those with high

2049
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:31,600
severity well here you have the list

2050
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:34,240
with details this particular event you

2051
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:36,180
can also see that on Jason if you want

2052
02:02:34,240 --> 02:02:39,250
to do anything with it but anyhow please

2053
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:47,590
object you see with all doubt those

2054
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:54,750
details let me try and find it this was

2055
02:02:47,590 --> 02:02:58,050
a backdoor attack an attempted attack

2056
02:02:54,750 --> 02:03:02,320
all sorts of details and information

2057
02:02:58,050 --> 02:03:05,860
this is a dashboard a panel which is

2058
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:10,139
really interesting to have everything

2059
02:03:05,860 --> 02:03:10,139
under control in a very graphic

2060
02:03:12,329 --> 02:03:20,228
design so that you can then do other

2061
02:03:16,659 --> 02:03:22,989
things more automatically so last but

2062
02:03:20,229 --> 02:03:26,679
not least my recommendations for guard

2063
02:03:22,989 --> 02:03:31,268
duty basically please activate it is

2064
02:03:26,679 --> 02:03:33,400
priceless say how often you want to send

2065
02:03:31,269 --> 02:03:37,300
events to cloud watch you should monitor

2066
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:42,400
all your resources securely and that's

2067
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:45,179
it that's all from me I think I now need

2068
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:47,709
a little bit of fresh air that's already

2069
02:03:45,179 --> 02:03:54,039
unless you have any questions which I'll

2070
02:03:47,709 --> 02:03:58,449
be delighted to answer well car Duty is

2071
02:03:54,039 --> 02:04:01,449
offered for free for one month and then

2072
02:03:58,449 --> 02:04:05,400
after that your you'll be charged

2073
02:04:01,449 --> 02:04:05,400
depending on the amount of information

2074
02:04:06,059 --> 02:04:12,699
because it generates data right so

2075
02:04:10,360 --> 02:04:15,429
depending on the number of data that it

2076
02:04:12,699 --> 02:04:18,518
saves for you you get charged more or

2077
02:04:15,429 --> 02:04:22,090
less oh well you get charged twice for

2078
02:04:18,519 --> 02:04:27,519
that in fact for storage and for

2079
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:29,289
analysis come power but you get it for

2080
02:04:27,519 --> 02:04:34,659
free for for the first month any more

2081
02:04:29,289 --> 02:04:38,219
