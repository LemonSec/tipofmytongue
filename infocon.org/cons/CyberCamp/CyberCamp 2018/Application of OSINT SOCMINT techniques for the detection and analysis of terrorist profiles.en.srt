Carlos says that those they will tell us

9
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:44,089
how terrorist organizations organize

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,059
themselves to make the most of these

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:56,090
foreigner abilities please access a are

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:58,880
in Phoebe and on Twitter with the cyber

13
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:01,640
camp hashtag I'm not going to take any

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,449
of their time well Carlos is an analyst

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:09,200
villain Vicente was the founder of the

16
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:12,380
Spanish chapter for his organization and

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:20,299
the author of the info leak - I hope you

18
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:21,729
enjoyed their presentation good

19
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:25,070
afternoon

20
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:27,619

and logically I want to thank them for

24
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:41,030
inviting us to be here today to tell you

25
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,040
about techniques and tools that can be

26
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:49,880
useful when we investigate potential

27
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:53,869
suspicious profiles for different

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,839
terrorist individuals or organizations

29
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,880
that's the topic for our presentation

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,490
today

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:06,890
Carlos and I will take it in turns there

32
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:09,919
will be some for more explanations some

33
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:14,480
more practical work we will tell you

34
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,100
about a hadees' terrorism well here we

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,950
see the table of contents for our

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,500
presentation starting as I said with

37
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:30,839
jihadist tear

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:34,320
ISM and Carlos will tell you more about

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,560
this site or things those of you who

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,790
work with cyber intelligence and

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:47,880
jihadist profiles Carlos is a true

42
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:50,670
specialist we hope you find our workshop

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,150
interesting I would also like to thank

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,649
the organizers and all of you for making

45
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,890
it here nice and early

46
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,170
straight after lunch this is a little

47
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,920
bit of background here we see this piece

48
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:08,458
of infographics the Spanish Ministry for

49
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,299
the interior summarizes the different

50
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:16,140
operations they have been covering in

51
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:21,600
2017 I don't want you to think so much

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,859
about the I show details but I just want

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,680
you to see that there is a very

54
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,280
homogeneous distribution of the

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,390
different operations on the eastern

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,870
coast Catalonia up in the Northeast and

57
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:40,170
in Madrid the capital city logically

58
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,209
there is a higher volume of people

59
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,339
who've been arrested accused of he had

60
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:49,080
his terrorism let me just tell you about

61
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:53,750
this study covering the period from 2013

62
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:57,930
to 2017 where 234 people were arrested

63
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,769
accused as suspected terrorists

64
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,920
terrorists

65
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:08,670
well 51% were accused for disseminating

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:12,690
propaganda on social media that's the

67
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:16,459
new scenario because a hadees' terrorism

68
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,670
then people tend to think about attacks

69
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,820
against the police bombs

70
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:27,030
[Music]

71
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:31,659
so how does that have to do with cyber

72
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:34,090
jihadist terrorism well is everything

73
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:39,450
that has to do with ehad is terrorism on

74
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:43,869
the cyberspace attacks where the

75
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:48,670
cybernetic attacks where the motivation

76
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:51,310
is a hardest ideology and here we can

77
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,940
see this poster that was published by

78
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:58,510
one of the groups that later we will

79
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:02,469
refer to them during the presentation is

80
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,510
a group of inverted commas hackers and

81
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:09,280
they published this that they posted

82
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:11,740
this poster this is terror not just from

83
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,500
a physical point of view like in the

84
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,130
terrorist attacks in Barcelona or Madrid

85
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,640
they actually mix that with the virtual

86
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:26,230
environment and statistically we know

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,570
that about 50% of those arrested had to

88
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:32,980
do with physical terrorist attacks

89
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:39,330
whereas the remaining 50% it had to do

90
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:46,750
with trying to capture new members and

91
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:49,810
also with propaganda here we can see

92
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:54,480
this piece of infographics that tells us

93
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:57,700
how at the top we have the dice

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:03,480
propaganda organization here at the

95
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:07,870
bottom we see shall we say the content

96
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:12,100
consumers and originally their objective

97
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:17,230
was meant to be attracting combatants

98
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,630
that is convincing them later to travel

99
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:23,770
over to Syria or wherever they were

100
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:27,430
needed to wage their war well more and

101
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:31,909
more they're trying to attract cyber

102
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:36,170
competi combatants that is people who

103
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:40,160
and not go and physically battle or

104
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:43,040
fight but actually to disseminate this

105
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,610
propaganda and also for attacks

106
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:49,600
to take place in their own countries of

107
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,640
residence are we just talking about

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,890
terrorists in general well that's not

109
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,110
really the case here we can see how

110
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,990
there are people who are followers or

111
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:04,670
who sympathize with that ideology who

112
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:08,000
followers who then some of them I showed

113
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:11,150
terrorists there are people who remain

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,730
for a long time at the same level of

115
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:17,330
that pyramid whereas in other cases and

116
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:20,330
people start at the bottom but then they

117
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,310
climb up that ladder quite fast in some

118
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,810
cases now we will continue to hear now

119
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:32,870
from within them so we'll be talking a

120
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:36,560
lot about the social media we will be

121
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:41,840
talking about physical social networks

122
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,200
as well physically so because before a

123
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:51,140
virtual social media started this was

124
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:58,909
the scenario somebody was connected with

125
00:07:51,140 --> 00:08:02,719
different people but a limit connections

126
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:06,730
and nodes were not those many whereas

127
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:11,480
the social media more and more has

128
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:16,760
extended the number of contacts and

129
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:18,940
nodes that we have contact with which is

130
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,510
very relevant in the case of terrorism

131
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:27,320
we know that a little bit about facts

132
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:31,190
and figures talking about social media

133
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:34,490
and the title of our presentation a part

134
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:38,390
of it has to do with soap mint because

135
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:42,289
some 80% of intelligence generation

136
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:47,930
nowadays has to do with

137
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:52,269
analysis and interpreting data that are

138
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:55,550
connected with open source computing and

139
00:08:52,269 --> 00:09:00,040
social media how play a very relevant

140
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:03,829
role the level of exposure that we have

141
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,630
for other people to know what we say is

142
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:11,229
completely different now with social

143
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:15,920
media when we talk about identifying

144
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:18,170
people who are more relevant in this

145
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,979
network for instance well that's very

146
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:25,910
different now with social media in as

147
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:30,410
far as investigation is concerned so

148
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:34,009
there's the social network circle the

149
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:38,240
social media circle and what we're

150
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:42,310
interested in is that a overlap between

151
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:47,510
those two circles that's where we like

152
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:54,138
investigating and identify an individual

153
00:09:47,510 --> 00:10:00,649
at that area of overlap here we can see

154
00:09:54,139 --> 00:10:03,430
what investigations used to cover in the

155
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:07,269
past not so recent past

156
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:10,790
investigators would work like this

157
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:12,980
that's right because in the past you

158
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:18,160
would be investigating you would have

159
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:21,529
your sources for information so during

160
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,740
the investigation you would try and find

161
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:28,699
which member of this group was most

162
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,910
relevant for efforts to be focused on

163
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:35,420
that particular person and make the most

164
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:38,990
of the resources but that has been

165
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:44,120
changed recently that's right with

166
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:47,269
social media now that system is much

167
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,580
more dynamic much more complex so what

168
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:52,940
tools and techniques

169
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:56,780
can we use so that we can make the most

170
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:03,110
of any information that we can access so

171
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:05,709
that our resources are better used this

172
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:08,600
is the cyber caliphate

173
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:12,200
what do we mean by that well we talk

174
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,830
about dice but it could be any other

175
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:20,330
terrorist group well when they declared

176
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:24,580
their Caliphate they were talking about

177
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:29,300
something that was very much physical

178
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:33,500
geographically physical but then more

179
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:37,400
and more in the social media there's

180
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:42,050
something called the cyber caliphate

181
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,699
a label they quite like because the

182
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:49,370
number of the groups that have been set

183
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:54,260
up have been named according to this

184
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:56,030
name so what do they use normal social

185
00:11:54,260 --> 00:12:01,640
media whether it is Facebook Twitter

186
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:05,420
Instagram blogs then the zero zone for

187
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:15,920
content dissemination telegram what's up

188
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:21,770
less so and threema and then the Tor

189
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:28,160
network free net I 2p not so much

190
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:33,470
because their identity is much more

191
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:38,209
easily identified in those cases so they

192
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:42,380
tried very very hard with manuals and

193
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:47,710
handbooks about how to use the Tor

194
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:50,860
network and so on

195
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:54,700
but they also you know perfectly well

196
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:58,960
that their users find this a lot harder

197
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:01,930
that anonymity is a lot harder to

198
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:05,460
achieve much harder than if they used

199
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:09,699
telegram say so if they use a virtual

200
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:12,990
number to set up a new account with

201
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:15,580
telegram you just need a phone number to

202
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,740
register a new account telegram never

203
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:25,060
asks you to access your account ever

204
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:28,120
again so I start a new account I then I

205
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:31,510
get rid of that phone number

206
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,540
there's no way to again connect that

207
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:37,870
person with a particular account that's

208
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:42,099
why the Tor network is a lot harder to

209
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:47,110
use for them than telegram telegram

210
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:50,350
allows for up to 1.5 gigas it to be

211
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:56,680
transferred it allows for backup

212
00:13:50,350 --> 00:14:05,380
channels you have your own sort of cloud

213
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:08,589
as well so no matter how much we make an

214
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:11,680
effort yet they're always ahead of us an

215
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,870
administrator can be in charge of a

216
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:20,430
number of different channels so when the

217
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:20,430
police close a particular channel oh

218
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:30,790
they lose is their followers then what

219
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,950
they would do is again disseminate their

220
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:35,740
link in the rest of the channels they

221
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:39,490
operate and the channel is active back

222
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:43,090
again so no matter what we try and do to

223
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:47,750
stop these channels they as I said

224
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:50,509
sprout back very quickly back again

225
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:55,819
because the social media disseminate

226
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:59,259
their messages and either hide their

227
00:14:55,819 --> 00:15:01,599
identity messages are very very easily

228
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:06,740
disseminated through the social media

229
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,110
that's right so from January sorry let

230
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,709
me stop and starts again

231
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:15,189
so as far as we can see telegram and

232
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:19,149
Twitter are the two main platforms

233
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:22,399
terrorists use for a doctrine nation and

234
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:24,470
dissemination of their messages there

235
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,079
are other platforms that are used as

236
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:33,439
well but volume-wise these two are the

237
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:36,589
giant so from January to November this

238
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:40,849
year just to give you an idea we have

239
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:43,040
been monitoring channels that might have

240
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,800
to do with terrorist organizations well

241
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:56,589
I actually monitored over four million

242
00:15:45,800 --> 00:16:00,649
messages in my opinion this zero zone

243
00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:04,550
for dissemination means that all the

244
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:07,300
contents go on telegram first and then

245
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:10,189
from telegram and they're further

246
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,309
disseminated a and spread through other

247
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:17,389
made through other channels for instance

248
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:19,610
from telegram to Twitter and then on the

249
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:22,490
Twitter account again you would have

250
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:27,189
links and connections with other social

251
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:31,730
media with other storage possibilities

252
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:34,790
back and forth so out of those over four

253
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:39,860
million messages that were analyzed we

254
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:43,939
found that over 1.5 million of URLs were

255
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:49,089
shared initially published or posted on

256
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:52,849
telegram and then on to Facebook Twitter

257
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:58,610
Google Drive a long list

258
00:16:52,850 --> 00:17:04,819
of them this image is a an infographic

259
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:06,650
that stands for the share of information

260
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,939
that we shared through the different

261
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:13,880
channels so again it's telegram that is

262
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:18,230
the largest to start off with but for

263
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:22,630
instance if I have 10 journals as soon

264
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:26,540
as I set up my 11th channel then I

265
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:29,300
disseminate they contact for that new

266
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:35,000
channel on the other day on the first 10

267
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:37,550
logically so the the following main

268
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,360
channel for dissemination would be

269
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:43,940
Twitter so most of them start on

270
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,240
telegram then they go onto Twitter and

271
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:49,700
then sometimes back to telegram again to

272
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:54,850
it through to a different channel on

273
00:17:49,700 --> 00:18:02,810
telegram they have a very clear specific

274
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:06,679
target now we consume multimedia and

275
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:09,830
Technology very very easily and apart

276
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,620
from having all sorts of different

277
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:15,820
messages well services sorry

278
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:19,209
we can see the type of messages they

279
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:23,929
disseminate it which only last year

280
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:30,250
almost 300,000 videos a 1.2 million

281
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:34,760
images 11 111 thousand audios that

282
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:38,260
almost 35,000 zipped files forty-four

283
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:42,250
thousand five thousand documents and

284
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:48,110
almost 15 thousand applications so

285
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:50,480
followers of terrorists logically find

286
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:56,060
it very very simple to have a mobile

287
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:58,640
phone and if a URL has been

288
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,669
there's no need to go to the computer at

289
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,210
home and securitize or secure anything

290
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:08,210
let's just watch it and share it on

291
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,780
their mobile phone that's their normal

292
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:15,230
target and that type of individual and

293
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:21,160
that's why they publish these types of

294
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:24,470
contents and telegram has no storage

295
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:29,950
limitations particularly they don't need

296
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:32,210
to count that is under 140 characters or

297
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,550
they don't need to make sure that is

298
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,190
only very short videos telegram makes it

299
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:41,590
very easy for them that's right and also

300
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:47,240
their service for storage on the cloud

301
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:50,060
that's right for instance films are not

302
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,050
particularly shared on torrents very

303
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,629
much these days

304
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:56,120
it's becoming more and more common doing

305
00:19:53,630 --> 00:20:00,310
so on telegram why because of the

306
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:04,280
storage capacity there's no limit really

307
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:06,770
for a content storage they use telegram

308
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,170
for storage and they have their

309
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,990
handbooks and instructions explaining

310
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,300
how when a channel has a lot of

311
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:18,200
interesting content there should be

312
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:20,600
backups of those contents so that they

313
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,290
can then be uploaded again very very

314
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:28,429
easily if anything went wrong they also

315
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:33,800
often ask their followers to make sure

316
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:41,770
that if a channel goes and there's

317
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:47,810
always email address or an alias or NIC

318
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:51,760
why because there are different types of

319
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,760
channels we haven't explained that yes

320
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,699
if I might let me just summarize that

321
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:04,959
side of things because otherwise you get

322
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:08,260
a little bit lost their system for

323
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:14,320
propaganda is distributed in my opinion

324
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:18,760
into four groups for contact content

325
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,129
dissemination one is their official news

326
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,320
channel for instance when there is a

327
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:25,000
terrorist attack anywhere in the world

328
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,240
they claim it

329
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,700
they have agencies for instance this is

330
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,360
Mac one of their agencies but they have

331
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:36,880
them all over the world in all sorts of

332
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,340
different languages they do their

333
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,430
translations from Arabic which is the

334
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:47,020
normal first language into all sorts of

335
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:50,620
language languages and dash says these

336
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:56,260
are independent agencies that they only

337
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:58,270
publish information that has nothing to

338
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:02,740
do with terrorism but we know they do

339
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:06,580
really this type of channel is just in

340
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:09,790
charge of dissemination because there

341
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:13,169
are other channels that are not just

342
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:16,330
about dissemination but rather

343
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:19,000
dissemination with interaction there is

344
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:21,550
no interaction on of official channels

345
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,920
you need to be invited to be there and

346
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,020
then you can be a consumer of their

347
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:29,850
contents but there's no interaction with

348
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,850
admins or with other users

349
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:40,410
what else do we have well the non

350
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:44,080
official or unofficial news agencies

351
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:47,470
they pick up on news published by

352
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,379
official agencies and apart from

353
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,809
disseminating that content they do more

354
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:58,000
than that they translate into different

355
00:22:52,809 --> 00:23:01,178
languages whether it's pieces of news or

356
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,670
handbooks or instructions a lot of the

357
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,840
times from English into different

358
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:12,820
languages for instance this agency

359
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:17,459
24-hour caliphates publishes in lots of

360
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:21,909
different languages to again disseminate

361
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:27,240
their messages now this channel allows

362
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:32,610
for interaction you can read and share

363
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:35,980
contents posted by other users there are

364
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:38,919
sometimes internal debates about the

365
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:44,260
quality of a particular content or about

366
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:46,750
the purpose for a particular event here

367
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:52,540
we have the third type of channel which

368
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:58,990
is the fan boys boys channels what is

369
00:23:52,540 --> 00:24:01,510
that well and they repost news both from

370
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,210
official and unofficial channels but

371
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:08,500
they do so quite freely shall we say for

372
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:11,910
instance also posting posters and

373
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:15,480
infographics and multimedia content

374
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,480
which are quite

375
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:26,260
quite controversial trying to encourage

376
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:29,330
their followers to do certain things and

377
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,420
their contents logically can be shared

378
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:36,129
but also you can debate you can add

379
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:42,020
additional contents you can add links to

380
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:45,710
other sites and so on so just for you to

381
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:51,350
get an idea how important these fanboy

382
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:53,600
Boise channels actually are because

383
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:59,590
sometimes people say well this is not an

384
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:02,570
official officially terrorist channel

385
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,730
terrorists don't actually own these

386
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:08,570
channels were here look at this image

387
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:11,360
here these two police officers the image

388
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:14,810
has been taken from the back and right

389
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:19,159
behind them there's a fan and here is an

390
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:22,820
armed with a knife this is an image

391
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:25,700
where the message is those two police

392
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:28,700
officers are being threatened with a

393
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:35,300
knife some of you might think well so

394
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:36,560
was why is that important well when in

395
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,610
Cornelia

396
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:44,360
near Barcelona there was an attempted

397
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:46,760
knife thing of a female police officer

398
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,129
at the door at the entrance of the

399
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,430
police station but this poster had been

400
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:56,300
posted only three days before that

401
00:25:52,430 --> 00:26:01,190
attack took place is that relevant or

402
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:04,690
not when I talk about posters pop is a

403
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:09,490
label I've given it this type of image

404
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:09,490
here on the right we can see a poster

405
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:16,760
here it says that dice is beating Spain

406
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:23,240
one middle well that was just before the

407
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:28,690
Barcelona attacks the other type of

408
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:34,120
channel are groups of hackers that

409
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:34,120
organized actions on the social media I

410
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:44,770
can tell you that in this type of group

411
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:48,740
there's a massive scanning so that

412
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:55,120
Facebook publications it can be used for

413
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:55,120
their own interest they also try and

414
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:06,820
post and repost a content airflow taken

415
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,820
from other channels

416
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:21,700
so this is a way to follow and

417
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:25,390
understand the ideas they promote and

418
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:30,010
disseminate that's right they sometimes

419
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:35,470
use mass media to try and attract new

420
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:37,960
followers new combatants so they can be

421
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:43,270
a doctrine ated and become full members

422
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:47,530
well in this case - hackers what do they

423
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:50,410
want well new members because some of

424
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:53,770
them have been eliminated or arrested

425
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:57,310
and sometimes because they have internal

426
00:27:53,770 --> 00:28:01,030
divisions here we can see that two of

427
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:04,659
them have disappeared over a period of

428
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:09,940
just a few months months so groups tend

429
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:12,130
to come ago and what do they what do

430
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,840
they do well sometimes to become a

431
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,420
member you need to go through different

432
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:21,340
filters and prove that you can do

433
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:25,150
different activities to explain what you

434
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:31,209
can contribute so I explained about the

435
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:35,620
propaganda organization how they try and

436
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:38,260
attract new cyber jihadists and what

437
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:41,919
they want over and above anything else

438
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:44,290
is users consumers of those contents

439
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:49,590
with reason telegram on Twitter whatever

440
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:52,780
and once they've been attracted as

441
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:55,780
followers or sympathizers well they can

442
00:28:52,780 --> 00:29:04,720
go up that ladder that pyramid I showed

443
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:06,310
earlier to become full terrorists this

444
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,710
is the kind of thing that will look out

445
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:13,830
for here we can see how this man says

446
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,260
clearly hello people in Spain I'm

447
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:19,530
looking for people in Spain sorry so

448
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:22,050
they can carry out a terrorist attack

449
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:27,629
this is the kind of message that we look

450
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:30,740
out for this piece of infographics we

451
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:34,530
see shows us the different elements that

452
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,750
are involved in these activities on the

453
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:40,310
social media with different nodes

454
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:43,560
different members this is the type of

455
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:48,000
information and data that we try and

456
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:51,870
analyze and process so that is not just

457
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:56,390
information but true intelligence so

458
00:29:51,870 --> 00:30:00,330
when we try and identify individuals and

459
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:05,720
connections and nodes that's where a

460
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:10,110
social media and intelligence tools are

461
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:13,470
ideal what do we need so that we have

462
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,770
true high quality intelligence we need

463
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,770
to combine products from different

464
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,770
disciplines

465
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:27,930
we'll see later

466
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:32,189
about a different mints ument

467
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:34,620
for instance humans is one of the

468
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:43,200
products that is working quite well for

469
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:46,020
us so if you asked what intelligence

470
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,100
analysis actually means well we

471
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:54,600
immediately think of films that we've

472
00:30:50,100 --> 00:31:00,480
watched we think of the CIA the the mi6

473
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:04,290
Mossad and yet I just wanted to realize

474
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:07,250
that nowadays you don't even need to

475
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:12,240
think about that high level of

476
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:14,900
organization for us to talk about

477
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,900
intelligence

478
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:23,559
a lot of individuals devoting the

479
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:26,230
necessary time and resources can access

480
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:29,440
information and turn interval

481
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:33,429
intelligence and disseminate it for a

482
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:37,870
third party to consume honestly anybody

483
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:40,000
at home from their home with very few

484
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:44,520
resources with access to the social

485
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,290
media can access and disseminate

486
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:50,679
intelligent information I'm not going to

487
00:31:47,290 --> 00:32:00,520
give you a lot of definitions about

488
00:31:50,679 --> 00:32:05,170
ocean and segments in the case of oceans

489
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:09,700
open source intelligence its information

490
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:17,470
data facts and figures based on open

491
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:19,510
source technology gathered from publicly

492
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,490
available sources for the purpose of

493
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:25,330
meeting specific intelligence

494
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:31,360
requirements the beauty of oesn't is

495
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:35,760
that we can supply all of that at the

496
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:40,570
right time because late is too late

497
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:45,370
obsolete information won't be useful for

498
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:49,480
the purposes they have maybe it would be

499
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:51,040
useful to prevent future problems or

500
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,940
whatever but not to carry out a

501
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:57,760
particular terrorist activity now sock

502
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:01,210
mint would be very much the same thing

503
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,410
but focusing on social media monitoring

504
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:07,630
social media extracting information

505
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:12,000
interpreting what it means to reach

506
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:17,110
certain conclusions that is identifying

507
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:20,770
profiles and individuals in our case so

508
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:24,780
for this we need to start at the virtual

509
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,780
world connections

510
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:31,380
remember the image we showed you earlier

511
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:33,900
where there was that overlap between the

512
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:37,890
two circles so we can find people who

513
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:41,100
are within that overlapping area and is

514
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:44,220
that an easy task not at all but there

515
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:47,399
are ways and means and tools to do so

516
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,410
and later on we will tell you more about

517
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:53,360
those that's right

518
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:53,360
because sometimes we just have

519
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:03,060
indications not evidence but at least a

520
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:12,030
little bit of an indication that will

521
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:14,759
lead us where we go kommen Todd oh

522
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:16,649
podemos say podemos llegar so we forgot

523
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,370
about the CNI sorry about that but we

524
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:23,279
will try next you reach out to users

525
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:28,830
base as we said on the way they use the

526
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:31,770
social media or Internet as a home about

527
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:35,340
as we will see we can try and reach them

528
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:38,129
through the content they Eve disseminate

529
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:43,679
they post and we will see a few examples

530
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:46,080
so we will have a graph so this is a

531
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,889
graph let's figure this is a nice

532
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,179
structure we got plays well there's a

533
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:56,129
series of people here and what we are

534
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:58,530
interested in in learning which one we

535
00:34:56,129 --> 00:35:03,540
want to interact with or which one we

536
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:07,700
wanna address or look into was in other

537
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,700
two years more resources a b c d

538
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:18,330
l depend on what our intentions are not

539
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:26,640
the same to try and reproach someone yes

540
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:29,460
if by using social through

541
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,410
formulate I can see who is the one on

542
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,880
which all the communications convert so

543
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,420
that's the way to learn what's going on

544
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,490
there and so I might the warranty in a

545
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,380
Cell the--wait come and approach them

546
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,569
that if I'm interested in working on

547
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,400
with this speech because that's the

548
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:47,130
person or the channel that has a radical

549
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,170
speech or that it's increasing that

550
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:52,170
which is a I might be interested in

551
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:55,289
coming closer to a or someone else

552
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:57,599
indirectly to try and have an

553
00:35:55,289 --> 00:36:00,750
influential action in order to reduce

554
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,329
the or narrow channel philosophize this

555
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,130
speech or the actress but if we see that

556
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:09,170
a B and C are in an argument

557
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:11,970
I can also approach C to incentivize

558
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:16,079
that kind of a problem inside of the net

559
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:18,149
it will always be dependent on the kind

560
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,000
of interests we want and the time we

561
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:25,349
have you know that you approach a

562
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:30,529
profile like this it's not Facebook and

563
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:32,730
I befriend you it takes lots of work and

564
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:35,130
environment and context and it takes

565
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:40,339
time and based on the needs we have and

566
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,339
the time available techniques will vary

567
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:46,549
so here you have what we said how we at

568
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:49,349
first when we were talking about

569
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:52,259
official agencies which was one of the

570
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:55,289
main disseminators of content II a

571
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:59,119
doctrine Nader to indoctrinate or

572
00:36:55,289 --> 00:37:02,789
convince the followers for to change

573
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,869
their mindset or become radical we refer

574
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:09,569
to you the Mac a a Mac agency up until

575
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:13,420
recently it was available um telegram

576
00:37:09,569 --> 00:37:16,990
and with this agency

577
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,970
as soon as it was parted it was reported

578
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:24,009
to Twitter but it took Twitter several

579
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:26,379
days to close it down here because well

580
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:29,850
that's the screenshot and we've seen

581
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:34,600
information is very volts high

582
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:36,819
it is usually everywhere but even more

583
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,640
so in social media worries and now

584
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:43,740
online might be gone tomorrow or even

585
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:46,870
within a few minutes it'll be locked

586
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:49,029
deleted so we are interested in that

587
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:52,750
information we need to recover it and

588
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:53,230
start it you know that you have it later

589
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,810
on

590
00:37:53,230 --> 00:38:01,210
as for Twitter let me see if I can show

591
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:07,600
it to you but we'll try and show to you

592
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:11,110
what info leaks look like for which will

593
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:14,819
you Mac net us at all I developed myself

594
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:22,380
and helps much with this investigations

595
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:26,230
so it is a search inside the database

596
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:31,360
that I have stored with the content

597
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:33,730
published and then it scrapes for social

598
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:42,220
media or accounts mainly telegram

599
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:47,880
Twitter Instagram and Facebook that

600
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:50,859
process we've said so for 2018 that

601
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,370
would be over four million messages so

602
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:56,830
figure what the Preston time can be for

603
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:59,170
this you know the to save as the 20

604
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:02,920
minutes of process and to get the date

605
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:05,880
of birth screen we got the foot clip

606
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,310
where you can see it

607
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,920
so first front roads would you want

608
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:15,240
managed to see match path if you're

609
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:21,620
lucky enough to see the scrim you would

610
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,620
see what we're talking about won't move

611
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,520
so let's get out of here

612
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:52,200
well I don't think that will be can we

613
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:54,930
can you see anything actually what we'll

614
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:57,029
do here is look into the database where

615
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,190
we keep it there all the information

616
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,920
here we see several options these are

617
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:05,040
some functions available here and so

618
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,650
what we will say is get us Instagram

619
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:15,359
Twitter and telegram account so here

620
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:17,900
what I want is to see accounts on

621
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:26,640
different social media and let's say

622
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:28,800
November takes us a minute it says so so

623
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,379
go grab a cafe well we will not be

624
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,680
grabbing a coffee but I rent here it is

625
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:40,170
working right so here you have it you

626
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:44,848
see let's see whether it moves and so it

627
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:58,650
gives gathering and posting the generals

628
00:40:44,849 --> 00:41:01,829
that it's finding will stop here but you

629
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:06,480
know that you get the information that

630
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:11,910
we collected again telegram Twitter

631
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:15,720
Facebook as well as Instagram we will

632
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:19,470
test the features of tea Forex in a

633
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:22,770
visual way this world magnet he'll

634
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:24,419
allows for a distraction of this

635
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:28,589
remaining of this information buffer

636
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:31,920
sells views as so screenshots and user

637
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:35,730
distraction we'll see that later but Tim

638
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,599
Felix is much more info leak is much

639
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,599
more powerful

640
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:48,809
well actually magnetics excellent and

641
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:50,180
later you will seem the power in that

642
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:57,619
too

643
00:41:50,180 --> 00:42:01,828
now what I'll do is I'll use my own

644
00:41:57,619 --> 00:42:07,069
laptop let's run

645
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:14,339
Timberlake so that you see some features

646
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:20,730
so this is magnetic we're we've got the

647
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:23,970
users here this is telegram that was for

648
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:26,670
you our else abstraction that are being

649
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:29,669
shared so we would get Twitter messages

650
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:34,680
and some specific accounts this is all

651
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:37,799
distracted magnetic one of the resulted

652
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:41,009
produces is a file where we have all

653
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:44,250
these users right yes well in order to

654
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:49,020
optimize and dynamize what we've done is

655
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:53,119
we've extracted it and within has a

656
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:53,119
dater and she he can process it

657
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:02,700
Australia and see if we can see it I

658
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:16,020
don't see here you can we alright

659
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:31,210
see now let's be realistic and okay kick

660
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,009
the air okay

661
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:43,720
or else the front road doesn't it to

662
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:48,210
take so to believe what we say let's try

663
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,209
this or else I will run it blindly

664
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:21,540
so I'll run it from here I'll explain

665
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:25,890
what I do next but same here you cannot

666
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:31,320
really see but what I'll do is as I said

667
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:34,879
wood used in phallic created a few years

668
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:37,680
ago and it's evolved what we had

669
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,620
well what our version has not been

670
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:45,629
released yet but it'll be released and

671
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:49,230
if you've seen version 2.4 is similar it

672
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:51,630
has a graph in graphic interface and it

673
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:55,080
allows for so many operations and you

674
00:44:51,630 --> 00:45:00,260
can look into Twitter and then have the

675
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:05,069
same results that can be whatever CS Evy

676
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:07,230
performance or other output formats so

677
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:11,180
what we'll do is starting with those

678
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,180
users on Magneto

679
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:22,620
so following these channels close to

680
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:24,420
terrorists so they're potential users by

681
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:28,890
the way let me say something I forgot to

682
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:32,600
mention we said but when we talk about

683
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:36,620
different types of channels apart from

684
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:41,960
mass media for propaganda

685
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:45,620
we have channels for sale of weapons

686
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:50,720
merchandising specific channels

687
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:55,040
Tec channels that helps others learn how

688
00:45:50,720 --> 00:46:00,529
to use girl targeted Oh tunnels where

689
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:03,830
sometimes gave or whatever so when you

690
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:07,040
drag all that information post it within

691
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:11,080
that information you can find but

692
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:17,300
there's one person on a given channel

693
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:19,819
we're a radical that may be first and a

694
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:22,790
link from BBC al mundo all those

695
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:26,450
newspapers where they refer to the

696
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:31,660
attack and I've seen these piece of news

697
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:36,169
and the BBC so they ask half-wit tenant

698
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:39,770
so there's also enhanced debates but

699
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:43,040
maybe what take town and claimed the

700
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:46,370
attack and if not um so you see there is

701
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:51,070
this internal debate sorry sorry about

702
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:51,069
my intrusion actually

703
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:08,890
so users can be active so we have

704
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:12,700
Twitter accounts and these get shut down

705
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:17,790
quite fast maybe not as fast as we would

706
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:21,790
like but thousands of users produced I

707
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:26,200
have been important to Timberlake and

708
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:32,560
one of the features it has so it's been

709
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:36,040
limited for this and demo only ten so it

710
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,200
uploads all ten users here yes to see

711
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,240
the proof of concept so out of a

712
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:45,250
thousand as you can see well some are

713
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:53,020
non-existent now so there's not an

714
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:55,530
existing user Niners still active so we

715
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,910
can go to Twitter and visit each profile

716
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:00,400
but doing so manually when we have

717
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:04,180
thousands and thousands of users it's

718
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,730
not doable it's not realistic so we can

719
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:09,850
upload it here and we can have a clear

720
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:14,320
overview fast overview of these users

721
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:17,460
features and on the profile pictures

722
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:19,540
background picture that kind of gives us

723
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:25,660
indications on the kind of users they

724
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:29,410
don't really need to be profiles of

725
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:34,569
interest to us because here you see some

726
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:37,120
such a sports person news agency maybe

727
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:38,770
they are just referring to a piece of

728
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,660
news but that's not what we're

729
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:45,700
interested in so we should also consider

730
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:49,470
that these are very volatile these are

731
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:54,640
accounts which usually have only few

732
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:58,240
followers and little interaction so we

733
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:01,330
will curate we have thousands of users

734
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:04,870
and let's filter out

735
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:09,009
those that have ten followers 100

736
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:15,940
followers sorry so we do filter and we

737
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:17,590
find he/she one has no follower and ha

738
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:24,420
is following no one and this other one

739
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:29,620
has 57 followers this is the username

740
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:33,900
and their own features so out of those

741
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:37,569
that we've seen we could select some

742
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,640
this one that has no picture this other

743
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:41,200
one has a picture but this other one

744
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,470
doesn't even have a profile picture a

745
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,689
background picture with this second one

746
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:52,209
let's see what's going on let's pick it

747
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:54,550
up load it into our interface and the

748
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,860
tool allows you to look into three

749
00:49:54,550 --> 00:50:02,110
larger groups so if we have three

750
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:04,690
targets first group would be about a

751
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:07,480
user profile seeing who they're related

752
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:12,840
to what about the followers apps they're

753
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:15,550
using time postings second group it beam

754
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:18,490
looking into specific geographical

755
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:22,240
locations of Walternate finally what's

756
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:25,029
happening at our March or a protest or

757
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:29,799
somewhere why there's been an attack we

758
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:31,840
want to see well the time is the hours

759
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,840
before the attack and everything else

760
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:40,840
and we can get information from there

761
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:43,870
and maybe it is through we're focusing

762
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:45,550
on the hardest terrorism but let me

763
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:49,120
highlight these informations is that

764
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:51,070
analysis can be replicated elsewhere in

765
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,720
other context settings maybe the

766
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:54,910
reserved advertising campaign and see

767
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,399
the impact we're not given district

768
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:59,589
years of them of that kind and then

769
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:03,010
there's a third group to look into info

770
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:06,160
like team Felix re and that is global

771
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:07,540
timeline so it's not a profound that we

772
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,049
have it's not a location that we have

773
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:13,750
but we want to see for example

774
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:16,470
information regarding words mentioned

775
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,470
with a cache

776
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:26,600
who's talking to him and get the

777
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:28,250
conversations out so when we don't have

778
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:32,060
a clear idea and it's all a bit bird

779
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:36,410
blurred so we had users and as part of

780
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:38,080
the users we chosen some that we thought

781
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:40,279
would be interesting for our

782
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:50,900
investigation and so what we're going to

783
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:54,050
do is okay first of all let's well we're

784
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:56,270
interested in finding out contacts so

785
00:51:54,050 --> 00:52:01,760
this is the account information first of

786
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:05,420
all we'll get that every information

787
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:09,440
produced here is all the big leaves and

788
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:12,770
pictures and teeth CSV as well can be

789
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:18,670
sent to visualization for do you have

790
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:18,670
graphs so here we have this user

791
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:28,090
the location can be tampered with but

792
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:32,880
well here we have Saudi Arabia 57

793
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:36,490
followers and just one Twitter post and

794
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,890
this was done in June and once this is

795
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:42,040
new information and is still an active

796
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:45,370
account as for the cases that we will

797
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:48,520
discuss today I don't want you to have a

798
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:50,680
number of users or a specific case I

799
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,750
just want you to understand it globally

800
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:58,740
you need to understand same as we said

801
00:52:52,750 --> 00:53:02,500
before Telugu it uses backup channels

802
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:06,700
built at a given time and published they

803
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:09,240
yes created them they store the content

804
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:11,770
and when needed it is posted

805
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,379
Twitter's the same they have the count

806
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:17,050
built maybe they haven't published a

807
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:19,390
theme for they can close it down fast

808
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:23,740
and well there is an incidence or an

809
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:28,839
attack or a claim that account gets the

810
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:33,600
avatar and I'm content and disseminates

811
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:37,440
for long as it can it's true

812
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:40,240
here we would like to see what the

813
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,360
environment of the user as you can see

814
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,890
there's barely any follower only little

815
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,230
information shared but there is a

816
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:51,009
feature on this tool to see who the

817
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:54,430
contacts are people that have interacted

818
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:56,200
with them so we can understand that the

819
00:53:54,430 --> 00:54:00,669
information of prettiest and we would

820
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:04,089
see that would be users that are aware

821
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:07,000
of each other's existence so these are

822
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:08,710
in interest maybe it's not that they are

823
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,300
following each other about they post

824
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:15,580
seed or replied or any other kind of

825
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:18,660
operations such as adding them to a list

826
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:22,779
maybe didn't write them to them but

827
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:26,379
added to a list with a given description

828
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:30,160
where there are other users that share

829
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:34,880
given ideology so what we'll do is

830
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:37,999
we will what limit versus bro this is

831
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,249
real time this is right now let's narrow

832
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:43,970
it down the number of contacts and so

833
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:48,348
now we are looking into it get

834
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:50,419
information out of surfers friends but

835
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:54,349
as I said before if it's been added to a

836
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:57,380
list or if this user who is included who

837
00:54:54,349 --> 00:55:01,339
what users have included our target and

838
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:03,410
to their list were this reading a

839
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:09,769
mention if someone has said the message

840
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:13,848
or can reply so we'll see what we have

841
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:16,609
this is a list of users this is done

842
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:21,829
fast and we have every detail here we

843
00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:24,558
see the relationship towards our target

844
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:26,509
that we got and what it has to do with

845
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,359
everything else so we have followers and

846
00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:31,849
friends and people they've interacted

847
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:36,880
with and that have been included in some

848
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:39,950
list and so we have the users ID we have

849
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:43,069
the background picture at any given

850
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:51,368
point we can click on the user and we

851
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:54,170
can see the profile or the twit post and

852
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:59,779
little movement here see only few

853
00:55:54,170 --> 00:56:04,059
followers little activity would start up

854
00:55:59,779 --> 00:56:07,339
very much to what we would say as in

855
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:11,420
that's how much interesting followers or

856
00:56:07,339 --> 00:56:15,890
friends or lists I will focus on

857
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:20,180
messages rather let's see who the user

858
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:23,509
has interacted with here you see that

859
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:26,109
just by clicking and filtering those

860
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:31,509
that have had some kind of relationship

861
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:31,509
we see the picture their user

862
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:48,799
so this first one if you don't speak

863
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:54,080
Arabic that'd be easier for you but here

864
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:57,470
we see a twit sent by a user rich we

865
00:56:54,080 --> 00:57:07,640
didn't tweet for a Maori target let's

866
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:10,689
check it out and is it I can not speak

867
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:14,450
Arabic Arabic bad let me translate it

868
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:18,740
for year using Google with Google

869
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:24,140
Translate not reliable but at least we

870
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:27,370
will get an idea war the messages so

871
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,370
here what it says is a

872
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:37,230
if it's a I can an Islamic connection

873
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:40,710
they should not be charged with

874
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:43,200
terrorism a kind of a message that might

875
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:45,720
mean nothing or maybe it does we are

876
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:50,689
interested in it because it's about an

877
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:54,149
event recent event all right

878
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:59,160
so following on this profile the one to

879
00:57:54,150 --> 00:58:00,990
be reached from the previous one so

880
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,950
these are clips and pictures published

881
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:07,319
and there you could get automatically

882
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:14,700
all that content out to look into it

883
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:19,560
later on but let's visualize it because

884
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:23,419
right before the presentation it was

885
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,420
working and I wanted to comment and add

886
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:31,549
[Music]

887
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:31,550
lots of pictures and cleaved

888
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:42,360
well there are references to bumps here

889
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:49,390
might be interesting right it gives us

890
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:53,010
extra information so I cannot copy paste

891
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:55,779
this one but with mag metal will see how

892
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:58,840
that weave will look into this picture

893
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:02,650
that we can download we feed it onto

894
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:04,840
magnetic and with OCR techniques now

895
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:07,300
that several techniques it is stretched

896
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:11,700
information minds it out translate it

897
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:21,400
and then we can perform searches on it

898
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:24,310
that will expedite sense all right back

899
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:27,190
to the tool we can keep pulling the

900
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:30,490
thread rich other users and other

901
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:36,730
followers with them and get the list of

902
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:39,569
the followers for a given user we could

903
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:46,180
see what topics are being discussed I

904
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:48,760
don't know the first 40 words mostly

905
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:50,890
used on a given day we can use those

906
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:54,310
filters and when we can filter per date

907
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:56,500
for a verb for number of tweets which

908
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:59,290
include a keyword or another one that

909
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:02,260
has been published on a given app for

910
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:07,150
example published from Instagram or

911
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:10,360
Android or iPhone and with multimedia

912
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:16,290
content that can be retreated so there

913
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:16,290
are several parameters what about words

914
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:23,549
for the last two weeks that's what's

915
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,868
preset that's the default value butter

916
01:00:23,549 --> 01:00:28,220
we can choose whatever we want

917
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:31,049
from five years ago because we want to

918
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:33,328
check out a specific time that's

919
01:00:31,049 --> 01:00:34,740
important because that way as I've said

920
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:44,299
before we can look into something that

921
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:47,240
has already happened and Paris attacks

922
01:00:44,299 --> 01:00:58,049
that was Friday the 13th

923
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:59,819
some years ago so there was an analysis

924
01:00:58,049 --> 01:01:02,759
back then of what was going on

925
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:04,769
so the broke into the area or the

926
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:07,289
locations where the attacks had happened

927
01:01:04,769 --> 01:01:11,058
as you probably remember there had been

928
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:11,059
several attacks at several locations

929
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:17,130
simultaneously all miscellaneous list so

930
01:01:14,309 --> 01:01:21,029
we can mine those locations out mind the

931
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:28,079
contents are actually wig out videos and

932
01:01:21,029 --> 01:01:30,680
pictures that is right before that and

933
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,680
that's

934
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:37,670
the attacks on the soccer stadium their

935
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:40,220
videos from just a few minutes before

936
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:42,260
and maybe on the video with someone of

937
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,848
interest a person of interest and see

938
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:49,700
who they were with whether they had a

939
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:52,070
backpack or maybe a red jacket so you

940
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:56,200
can imagine that would be information

941
01:01:52,070 --> 01:02:00,250
that we're interested in analyzing and

942
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:03,830
accessing what else can we find

943
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:10,010
information on protected accounts which

944
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:12,650
maybe you can't access the profiles not

945
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:18,380
so much the case is that we've told you

946
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:20,540
about right now so far and yet there are

947
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:26,630
different types of investigations

948
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:30,980
for instance in social engineering pen

949
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:33,980
testing or analysts who want to go

950
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:36,609
deeper into detail for a private

951
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:42,250
individual so we might be able to access

952
01:02:36,609 --> 01:02:47,720
accounts that are protected and then see

953
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:51,589
maybe user activities in this particular

954
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:54,368
case here what's been the activity in

955
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:54,369
the last year

956
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:06,569
let's run a search and let's see what we

957
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:08,880
can find this particular user not very

958
01:03:06,569 --> 01:03:14,749
interesting only one trees had been

959
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:20,759
posted but we can check and see if he

960
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:25,200
retweets horse videos or images or at

961
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:27,839
what times of day or nice so that that

962
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:34,078
might give us a clue of where they're

963
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:37,410
located geographically located trying to

964
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:43,619
guess if he tweets at night or during

965
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:44,819
the day so the most interesting area as

966
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:48,210
we said at the beginning of the

967
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:50,779
presentation for us is that area where

968
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:56,220
the physical world and the virtual world

969
01:03:50,779 --> 01:04:05,239
overlap imagine I start with a Twitter

970
01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:09,950
account in 2015 but I become a radical I

971
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:16,369
abandon my friends I make new

972
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:16,368
acquaintances and if I go back on time

973
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:22,859
if the police goes back and takes my

974
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:25,890
account

975
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:31,970
well they might come to that conclusion

976
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:31,970
and find some more signs and indications

977
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:40,950
for them to devise a particular

978
01:04:36,499 --> 01:04:44,970
hypothesis and eventually find somebody

979
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:47,730
of interest right we were telling you

980
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:53,098
about this user that we had found

981
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:56,579
indirectly through another user let me

982
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:59,220
just run a demo here for you to get an

983
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:02,840
idea how we can extract the multimedia

984
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:06,649
content this is the user

985
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:11,300
and I'm now going to extract multimedia

986
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:18,620
contents only focusing on say the last

987
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:21,190
50 tweets this man posted in this case

988
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:24,069
the system is going quite fast

989
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:28,100
downloading images and videos and

990
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:33,800
associated details and this is what we

991
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:36,860
would see for instance images of videos

992
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:40,430
that have been posted which application

993
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:44,450
he used for those posts if it was

994
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:49,580
multimedia content that were a response

995
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:54,460
some other some other user who likes or

996
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:58,970
how many likes or retweets and who by or

997
01:05:54,460 --> 01:06:02,900
seeing where the content originally came

998
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:06,109
from at what time if it was straight

999
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:13,490
afterwards or maybe the following day

1000
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:17,140
all of us they can give us some clues as

1001
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:19,729
to where the contents have been posted

1002
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:21,500
is it just very quickly for you to get

1003
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:25,700
an idea I wanted to show you that

1004
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:29,960
example so we could do something that is

1005
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:35,259
for the last five years say and those

1006
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:38,240
images could then be analyzed by magneto

1007
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:40,970
okay we can talk a little bit more about

1008
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:44,660
this too if we have additional time at

1009
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:49,959
the end I hope that you're getting an

1010
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:49,960
idea of what kind of work we do

1011
01:06:51,470 --> 01:07:00,680
as author of Tim Foley geolocation was

1012
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,529
really valued at the beginning

1013
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:06,080
extracting information and then using

1014
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:11,350
Google Earth and that's interesting

1015
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:11,350
right true but there's more than that

1016
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:25,820
using public information because there's

1017
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:32,050
information that doesn't depend on us if

1018
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:36,890
I see a tweets sorry if I post a tweet

1019
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:40,550
because I like running for instance and

1020
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:43,069
I post something and the police would

1021
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:45,170
know if they investigate me that I have

1022
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:49,130
that application that I use that

1023
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:51,230
application for running oh dear

1024
01:07:49,130 --> 01:08:00,910
unfortunately the large screen doesn't

1025
01:07:51,230 --> 01:08:00,910
seem to be working as a shame

1026
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:09,390
okay the presentation now continues

1027
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:13,620
talking about Thimphu leak and I just

1028
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:20,279
want to encourage you to download it and

1029
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:23,550
to make comments that will hopefully

1030
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:26,870
contribute to make it better not only

1031
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:29,520
that there are different Linux

1032
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:30,870
possibilities whether it's Kali well a

1033
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,920
number of them along

1034
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:39,800
Osen turks so if you're familiar with

1035
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:42,930
one of those you can use that particular

1036
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:45,870
version or you might want to have a look

1037
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:48,960
at the most recent version that I have

1038
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:52,470
on my repository if you access my

1039
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,770
website out there I don't know if those

1040
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:59,550
smaller screens are working

1041
01:08:54,770 --> 01:09:01,800
maybe we can enlarge glass so you can

1042
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:08,390
see it's a little bit better using the

1043
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:08,390
full screen that's better now this

1044
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:19,800
uh hora locum or Fisto hasta este

1045
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:24,350
momento ha sido como okay so magnet oh

1046
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:30,050
you can see has extracted some profiles

1047
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:34,290
for us in this case Twitter was our main

1048
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:37,790
interest so the extraction is very

1049
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:42,470
similar to what Tim for leaks does

1050
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:46,109
generating a particular type of file and

1051
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:49,620
again we want to see that overlapping

1052
01:09:46,109 --> 01:09:51,779
area where the physical world interacts

1053
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:54,870
with the virtual world we're going to

1054
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:59,969
see that with information and very

1055
01:09:54,870 --> 01:10:05,870
visually after processing the

1056
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:09,420
information the tool then needs to know

1057
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:13,019
what specifications we want to give it a

1058
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:18,590
for it to work in one particular way or

1059
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:23,820
another you see we need to specify here

1060
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:28,740
because it's an open source tool we can

1061
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:31,590
give all the information on profiles

1062
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:34,650
that we've investigated or well not

1063
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:37,410
investigated sorry dragged really so we

1064
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:41,670
can then investigate them well what we

1065
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:45,740
do then is importing them graphically so

1066
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:50,250
that through network analysis techniques

1067
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:53,010
we can then see visually see that

1068
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:56,570
interaction that overlapping area that

1069
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:56,570
we saw between those two circles

1070
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,900
[Music]

1071
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,900
I'm sorry

1072
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,150
ahsoka I was having some rough Oh static

1073
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:17,670
OH

1074
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:25,799
in this case we're going to see a static

1075
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:29,160
graph so first of all we get information

1076
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:32,790
from different profiles communicating

1077
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:37,530
amongst them that's all we had and then

1078
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:40,350
because we had raw data you can't tell

1079
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:43,050
what the network looks like which

1080
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:53,010
elements we want to go into more detail

1081
01:11:43,050 --> 01:12:00,600
into but now look at that oh there

1082
01:11:53,010 --> 01:12:05,250
the mouse doesn't seem to like me I want

1083
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:12,230
to zoom in but I don't seem to manage so

1084
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:12,230
what we're trying to do now if I manage

1085
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:18,720
I'm going to stop it first and then try

1086
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:20,850
again but anyhow the idea is that

1087
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:26,250
depending on the information that we

1088
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:28,530
gave we've given it it seems to have

1089
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:31,080
crashed but anyhow just to give you an

1090
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:36,080
idea every one of those dots is a

1091
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:40,260
twitter user and then the lines are

1092
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:45,660
messages that are shared posts that are

1093
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:48,710
shared and where that goes you can see

1094
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:54,920
that others on the top left there are

1095
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:54,920
great big nodes with a lot of friends

1096
01:12:55,179 --> 01:13:05,370
or followers and depending on what the

1097
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:09,540
theme is for that particular post well

1098
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:12,820
we might then select out of the maybe

1099
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:15,580
thousands of users maybe seven or eight

1100
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:20,400
that we think might be potentially

1101
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:20,400
interesting apologies because the

1102
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:27,340
interactive infographics didn't work but

1103
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,449
you we just wanted you to understand it

1104
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:34,980
that it really helps us understand the

1105
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:39,639
history and fluctuations of a particular

1106
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:44,739
communication system so let me try and

1107
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:49,050
show you now a little bit the same thing

1108
01:13:44,739 --> 01:13:52,900
but more visually because the previous

1109
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:55,420
graph it was a little bit static right

1110
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:59,860
it was a given point in time you don't

1111
01:13:55,420 --> 01:14:11,290
see who follows who for instance over

1112
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:14,530
time so

1113
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:17,860
show you now we have that head well

1114
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:23,740
that's our user and in that white dots

1115
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:26,139
there is content whatever type so

1116
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:29,290
depending on the extension of those

1117
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:31,720
contents that are posted that can give

1118
01:14:29,290 --> 01:14:36,070
us a good idea of what type of content

1119
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:38,680
they are being tweeted whether it is

1120
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:43,830
images or videos or what and then the

1121
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:48,250
green ray that stands for the type of

1122
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:51,309
dissemination or transfer so you see

1123
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:55,210
different people sharing contents in

1124
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:59,050
this case images you see how that

1125
01:14:55,210 --> 01:15:03,220
spreads out they come and go different

1126
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:08,700
messages different images and that goes

1127
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:12,990
on and on to give us an idea of the time

1128
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:12,990
involved in those connections

1129
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:23,310
this is like a slow-motion version just

1130
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,310
for you to get an idea of how it works

1131
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:32,790
for you to efficiently or and truly

1132
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:36,190
understand the power of what this can-do

1133
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:40,630
vamos a ver lament a como Syria Esai

01:18:53,589 --> 01:19:00,239
so here see tip I hope you can see that

1213
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:05,739
okay

1214
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:09,308
we saw the process dynamically earlier

1215
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:12,249
and now this is the static version on

1216
01:19:09,309 --> 01:19:15,429
this graph what is particularly

1217
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:19,079
interesting for as well each one of

1218
01:19:15,429 --> 01:19:23,019
those dots would be a user is a user

1219
01:19:19,079 --> 01:19:24,579
posting and disseminating contents so if

1220
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:27,099
I don't have enough resources to

1221
01:19:24,579 --> 01:19:27,608
investigate all those profiles what

1222
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:33,609
should I do

1223
01:19:27,609 --> 01:19:41,679
well logically focus on those that I

1224
01:19:33,609 --> 01:19:44,849
consider are the main notes and then I

1225
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:47,260
might say right I want to focus on

1226
01:19:44,849 --> 01:19:49,780
spanish-speaking channels or a

1227
01:19:47,260 --> 01:20:01,510
particular thematic channel and then I

1228
01:19:49,780 --> 01:20:02,370
would be really effective right so I as

1229
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:06,450
the same

1230
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:10,380
as we can study how it all works we can

1231
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:13,019
also see heat maps for instance for a

1232
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:17,460
time of day seeing how many messages

1233
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:20,280
were posted at that particular time I

1234
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:32,310
don't know if you can see it now you

1235
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:39,429
need to move on to the next one is that

1236
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:43,510
working now now it's stuck on the

1237
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:47,160
slide it's not our day right today

1238
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:47,160
not technically speaking anyway

1239
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:10,259
well he's a cadaver and Avila you know

1240
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:12,919
Amy already suffered other selects

1241
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,920
available in the fuel

1242
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:23,530
how does he see Molly early working with

1243
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:25,990
us now he's working so as I said we

1244
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:29,590
could see changes and fluctuations on

1245
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:33,760
different channels and here we see a

1246
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:37,090
heat map if we want to focus on a

1247
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:39,940
particular time of a particular day and

1248
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:43,740
see how many messages were posted or

1249
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:46,120
shared and so on we can do so also

1250
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:50,650
focusing on a particular channel like

1251
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:54,730
Twitter or a particular user or the time

1252
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:58,360
of day or nice well we know that user is

1253
01:21:54,730 --> 01:22:02,639
most active that's that's interesting so

1254
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:02,639
that I can keep an eye at those times

1255
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:11,350
can you tell them a little bit about

1256
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:14,890
space that's true I'd forgotten about

1257
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:19,420
that can you see that gap there between

1258
01:22:14,890 --> 01:22:22,000
let May and late June there's like a gap

1259
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:23,170
of information and when we first looked

1260
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,720
at that heat map

1261
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:28,270
I remember we said hang on a minute why

1262
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:29,320
our message is missing from that period

1263
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:31,810
of time

1264
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:37,690
well that was Ramadan that's what it was

1265
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:42,430
and on the social media people were

1266
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:44,969
asked to use the social media less in

1267
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:53,440
this case it was telegram so they could

1268
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:58,980
abide by Ramadan more more self so that

1269
01:22:53,440 --> 01:23:02,740
kind of heat map can give us clues and

1270
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:06,299
so that we can go from data and facts

1271
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:06,300
and figures to true intelligence

1272
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:20,690
so as I said we need to with this we can

1273
01:23:15,559 --> 01:23:23,479
hopefully track and find the most

1274
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:27,530
relevant individuals we've been talking

1275
01:23:23,479 --> 01:23:31,599
about user profiles that we might be

1276
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:35,179
interested in monitoring right so now

1277
01:23:31,599 --> 01:23:40,030
how can we get information from the

1278
01:23:35,179 --> 01:23:43,459
contents they post or share in this case

1279
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:48,429
our website we can see this website in

1280
01:23:43,459 --> 01:23:55,280
Spanish it was a shooting competition

1281
01:23:48,429 --> 01:23:59,090
they were talking about so this is a

1282
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:02,150
case of propaganda they're advertising a

1283
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:06,159
shooting course and explaining how

1284
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:11,058
they've gone about it in the past then

1285
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:14,209
on their next section they talked about

1286
01:24:11,059 --> 01:24:16,789
bias and how they look after their

1287
01:24:14,209 --> 01:24:19,489
members and followers because when we

1288
01:24:16,789 --> 01:24:21,800
talk about propaganda it is not just

1289
01:24:19,489 --> 01:24:24,518
them saying they should go and cut

1290
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:27,400
people's heads off they also talk

1291
01:24:24,519 --> 01:24:31,459
wonderful things about themselves

1292
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:35,360
sometimes messages are texts often in

1293
01:24:31,459 --> 01:24:43,059
Arabic with hashtags so he can then be

1294
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:45,820
shared and reposted and retweeted

1295
01:24:43,059 --> 01:24:51,420
or so that users can find them more

1296
01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:54,789
easily one of those images is a threat

1297
01:24:51,420 --> 01:25:02,400
in the case of the Barcelona terrorist

1298
01:24:54,789 --> 01:25:07,179
attack the other one talks about shehide

1299
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:10,449
training camps in Iran sometimes

1300
01:25:07,179 --> 01:25:14,520
documents look more like this where

1301
01:25:10,449 --> 01:25:19,239
there is an X excel sheet or a txt

1302
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:19,809
excels often have to do with the

1303
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:24,638
so-called

1304
01:25:19,809 --> 01:25:27,520
kill lists that is lists of individuals

1305
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:32,250
they were there they want to target and

1306
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:36,119
eliminate are those kill lists

1307
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:40,929
objectives sometimes they've hacked

1308
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:44,650
public organizations and published those

1309
01:25:40,929 --> 01:25:48,610
lists or posted those lists in this case

1310
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:51,009
if I have an American company that sold

1311
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:54,308
instruments and they dumped that

1312
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:57,400
database under fortunately ten Spanish

1313
01:25:54,309 --> 01:25:59,800
nationals were included on that list so

1314
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:03,329
when you monitor profiles we also try

1315
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:05,889
and be proactive as much as possible we

1316
01:26:03,329 --> 01:26:09,610
depending on what information we find

1317
01:26:05,889 --> 01:26:12,150
for instance we found this file where

1318
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:17,469
Spanish Nationals

1319
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:20,199
might be in danger or it's a threat

1320
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:24,369
right well we want to make the most of

1321
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:29,940
that and act upon it in the case of the

1322
01:26:24,369 --> 01:26:39,299
Spain IP file wow that was a die

1323
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:44,309
a pro - channel because there are cases

1324
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:48,330
where channels are not there on behalf

1325
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:54,540
of actual practitioners sometimes they

1326
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:57,450
just published propaganda or sometimes

1327
01:26:54,540 --> 01:27:01,470
they give them logistical support and

1328
01:26:57,450 --> 01:27:07,429
some 60,000 IPs were published in this

1329
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:07,430
case a threat of remote desktop

1330
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:13,350
vulnerability I said at the beginning of

1331
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:16,880
my presentation that they love posters

1332
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:19,470
and they posed in different languages

1333
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:23,040
Spanish is one of the most popular

1334
01:27:19,470 --> 01:27:26,580
languages I also said it earlier that

1335
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:29,430
they also publish handbooks and

1336
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:31,980
instructions about how to encrypt

1337
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:33,170
communications the one here on the right

1338
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:38,250
for instance

1339
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:43,920
explained step-by-step how to build this

1340
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:48,650
device a very simple device but it can

1341
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:48,650
actually make a train derail

1342
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:55,740
if you wonder would a follower go home

1343
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:57,840
and build something that isn't do

1344
01:27:55,740 --> 01:28:01,050
something like that just a couple of

1345
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:04,190
weeks later after this was posted there

1346
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:08,490
were a number of incidents in Catalonia

1347
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:13,440
where large boulders were positioned on

1348
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:18,179
the rail tracks so sometimes they don't

1349
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:22,769
copy exactly what was proposed but they

1350
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:26,520
adapted at the top we see the video with

1351
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:28,890
no time for authorship of the

1352
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,920
Barcelona's terror the Barcelona

1353
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:34,490
terrorist attacks and the one down below

1354
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,730
is a video explaining how to manufacture

1355
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:42,280
chemical weapons

1356
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:45,419
they also use browser extensions this is

1357
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:49,200
a program they used in the past for

1358
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:54,010
communications encryptions some

1359
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:59,670
indoctrination publications or posts in

1360
01:28:54,010 --> 01:29:05,890
this case on how to find IPS or phone

1361
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:07,900
phone books or and also explaining to

1362
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:10,710
their members how to increase their

1363
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:15,070
communications and data in this case

1364
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:17,830
Bitcoin addresses were posted why well

1365
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:21,280
because they want to access financial

1366
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:26,580
resources so we've been talking about

1367
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:30,489
files and images and audio and video

1368
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:36,210
because in the age of big data what they

1369
01:29:30,489 --> 01:29:39,610
do is try and use all that information

1370
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:41,860
turn into intelligence and that's what

1371
01:29:39,610 --> 01:29:44,679
we try and do as well to understand what

1372
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:48,580
they're doing so because there are so

1373
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:54,150
many messages and information that we

1374
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:57,640
need to monitor I I knew time ago that I

1375
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:59,410
we needed an application to be able to

1376
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:02,890
handle all of that and that's why I

1377
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:05,080
designed magnet all this application so

1378
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:07,390
that I can find the most extract the

1379
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:10,470
most interesting part of all that

1380
01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:13,840
information and one of the main elements

1381
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:17,530
that we often identify with social media

1382
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:20,080
are phone numbers so I'm going to show

1383
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:24,489
you now how a phone numbers can be

1384
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:26,790
extracted from social medias so social

1385
01:30:24,489 --> 01:30:26,790
media

1386
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:33,270
we want to try and get as much

1387
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:35,730
information as possible from what we can

1388
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:37,080
access that's right because sometimes it

1389
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:39,000
might be something small

1390
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:43,730
well it looks more right a phone number

1391
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:49,820
or a picture that might give us the clue

1392
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:49,820
for to move ahead in our investigations

1393
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:07,470
works and we'll see some of the elements

1394
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:09,599
that I have visible now we have a few

1395
01:31:07,470 --> 01:31:11,520
more features but it didn't fit into my

1396
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,850
display so I had to shorten it what if

1397
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:17,340
we are interested in is mining phone

1398
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:19,590
numbers are fears of what we can ask is

1399
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:22,680
the kind of information of prefixes that

1400
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:25,500
we're interested in here what we have is

1401
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:28,380
let's try what we are most interested in

1402
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:30,090
here that would be Spain so let's see if

1403
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:35,490
we have a Spanish Paris that we can get

1404
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:38,130
out of the database since we've been

1405
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:41,190
recording who will mask the numbers so

1406
01:31:38,130 --> 01:31:44,640
that they cannot be identified so here

1407
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:46,620
you can see there are seven phone

1408
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:53,340
numbers from Spain that can be located

1409
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:57,090
on this medium so 33 I think that's

1410
01:31:53,340 --> 01:31:59,310
France again well we have some first

1411
01:31:57,090 --> 01:32:01,950
this is the very last year that's right

1412
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:04,020
but all the data again yeah this is the

1413
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:05,460
same last year but what information can

1414
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:07,290
we get we are interested in the phone

1415
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:08,910
numbers I'm from here onwards we see

1416
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:10,530
there are different techniques and with

1417
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:12,960
the phone number you can reach users

1418
01:32:10,530 --> 01:32:14,759
social media all the kinds of

1419
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:18,720
information so there is an interesting

1420
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:21,450
element here as we said before at the

1421
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:24,960
beginning of this presentation and that

1422
01:32:21,450 --> 01:32:27,540
is the large number of people arrested I

1423
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,970
think I didn't say it but most of the

1424
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:33,120
people arrested were from Morocco first

1425
01:32:29,970 --> 01:32:35,520
or second generation and so we will try

1426
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:38,880
to find those phones from Morocco and

1427
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:41,610
why is that we see there are a few of

1428
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:44,400
those why because that's easy for them

1429
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:48,540
they can keep using Moroccan numbers in

1430
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:52,110
Spain and then we've through the contact

1431
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:55,140
network whether it is family or friends

1432
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:59,480
they can still get money on the card

1433
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:59,480
from from the source country

1434
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:11,739
what about the US yeah that's right

1435
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:17,519
it's rain only a few would show maracas

1436
01:33:11,739 --> 01:33:17,519
there were many more and and then the US

1437
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:24,219
so we've said so it is easy to use those

1438
01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:26,620
virtual numbers because most of the

1439
01:33:24,219 --> 01:33:31,840
virtual numbers are from the United

1440
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:34,989
States but if we check how many numbers

1441
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:37,210
start with a one that it is the prefix

1442
01:33:34,989 --> 01:33:40,239
for the US we see there are a few of

1443
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:45,390
those and that's where we see that there

1444
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:49,540
are some that use their own phone number

1445
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:51,040
and that's an indication the area code

1446
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:55,690
that's an indication we need to work

1447
01:33:51,040 --> 01:34:00,300
with but we can produce a list with it

1448
01:33:55,690 --> 01:34:03,549
so we've said and I've said Vicente said

1449
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:07,739
how after analyzing different kinds of

1450
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:07,739
profiles whether in Twitter or telegram

1451
01:34:08,219 --> 01:34:17,020
we have twitter we have in steam for

1452
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:21,489
leaks and magnetic so there is tracking

1453
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:24,400
of users followers and also pictures are

1454
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:28,209
mined out not just a profile but those

1455
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:33,339
posted because maybe a text we miner

1456
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:36,310
find something relevant on text but we

1457
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:38,770
can follow keywords and have a list of

1458
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:42,550
words that we might be interested in to

1459
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:44,320
have constant monitoring and here we

1460
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:46,360
might be interested in reading or

1461
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:50,830
interpreting the pictures that are being

1462
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:54,519
posted using old sphere or other

1463
01:34:50,830 --> 01:35:01,410
mechanisms this is a real example that

1464
01:34:54,520 --> 01:35:01,410
it was processed we mined the contact

1465
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:13,040
and so this is not we have blue shades

1466
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:14,930
and we have pictures and there's a whole

1467
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:17,570
range in there and from there onwards

1468
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:20,230
there's the first mining and then we

1469
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:23,090
translate it and that's when we can

1470
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:26,870
based on the kind of search we want to

1471
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:29,510
conduct I will be able to see if any of

1472
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:33,440
those profiles that well because of the

1473
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:35,600
user name or maybe the profile that we

1474
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:37,519
didn't find interesting but with an

1475
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,520
automated analysis of the pictures

1476
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:42,730
posted it could be interesting here you

1477
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,730
have

1478
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:50,440
because they claim the attack in

1479
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:52,420
Barcelona the same way here as we see

1480
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:55,179
this kind of a content we've also said

1481
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:58,710
there are some posters here what we see

1482
01:35:55,180 --> 01:36:04,780
is well see this

1483
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:06,700
we have Messi what an Emer here you have

1484
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:08,710
the information available in English and

1485
01:36:06,700 --> 01:36:11,019
you can read the image the picture

1486
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:14,020
interpreted and from their own roots

1487
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:16,270
with different filters so if I use Messi

1488
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:20,170
as a keyword we said that already

1489
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:22,360
these are not just about what so these

1490
01:36:20,170 --> 01:36:25,080
are tools that can use for detection of

1491
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:26,950
these profiles but also to detect

1492
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:31,630
brands or other kinds of information

1493
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:35,920
that you can find a useful so here you

1494
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:42,490
have a test that I will run for you if I

1495
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:47,070
manage this is what we said before let's

1496
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:49,599
try and find what we come from pictures

1497
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:52,000
so we said the attack of mouse on all

1498
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:55,060
right we've mention it so of all of

1499
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,790
those pictures this try and see if in

1500
01:36:55,060 --> 01:37:00,550
any of those pictures not as text but

1501
01:36:57,790 --> 01:37:05,530
actually embedded text let's try and see

1502
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:09,460
if they show Barcelona right so if it

1503
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:10,210
all works out for us should give us yeah

1504
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:13,690
it does

1505
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:17,170
ok so it should stop at some point here

1506
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:19,330
I showed you the string it interprets

1507
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:22,960
the picture so there's a world there is

1508
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:26,410
a sky diagram and the text from the

1509
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:28,270
picture it seems to be in English but

1510
01:37:26,410 --> 01:37:29,710
then the translation this is what we

1511
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:34,500
have this is a map of Europe as

1512
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:34,500
translated from 2017 and so

1513
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:52,880
if I get the URL and I'll look it up see

1514
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:56,480
this is a world map and there's not such

1515
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:59,090
information published here so see this

1516
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:02,360
is Spain in small print it says

1517
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:06,820
Catalonia and Barcelona if I had looked

1518
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:10,159
up Madrid probably that but been similar

1519
01:38:06,820 --> 01:38:12,889
all right next one same thing here so

1520
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:14,900
first interpretation probably Arabic

1521
01:38:12,889 --> 01:38:16,909
right so it's structured like this it

1522
01:38:14,900 --> 01:38:19,848
says it's advertised and it's a poster a

1523
01:38:16,909 --> 01:38:23,299
butter and it says that was the cutest

1524
01:38:19,849 --> 01:38:27,349
operations that says thumbs let's get

1525
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:30,440
the easiest one get the URL and search

1526
01:38:27,349 --> 01:38:41,110
through the database and see what what

1527
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:45,678
is it it's making a fool of me

1528
01:38:41,110 --> 01:38:47,570
so it's 4.5 million messages and imagine

1529
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:50,110
what it would be like to do so manually

1530
01:38:47,570 --> 01:38:52,820
it is not doable to have so many people

1531
01:38:50,110 --> 01:38:55,339
translators and people just downloading

1532
01:38:52,820 --> 01:39:02,150
images and pictures on going through all

1533
01:38:55,340 --> 01:39:07,159
of them this cannot be first one I've

1534
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:11,269
read it so

1535
01:39:07,159 --> 01:39:20,690
we haven't read this but what was it

1536
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:23,860
nine darkness and here you had materials

1537
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:27,349
Barcelona's struggle video so

1538
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:30,230
distraction here you can see that it

1539
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:33,500
helps you add is an indication that can

1540
01:39:30,230 --> 01:39:35,690
help you see this so if you've got this

1541
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:38,659
kind of a picture or a rather profile

1542
01:39:35,690 --> 01:39:42,678
that would be it if you're sharing these

1543
01:39:38,659 --> 01:39:45,080
link and this claim of Barcelona's

1544
01:39:42,679 --> 01:39:52,540
attack so that it would be interesting

1545
01:39:45,080 --> 01:40:00,699
to monitor it all right can you see this

1546
01:39:52,540 --> 01:40:04,010
can you so also following the process

1547
01:40:00,699 --> 01:40:08,269
what we find interesting is metadata

1548
01:40:04,010 --> 01:40:13,190
I haven't said yet by telegram what it

1549
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:16,330
does is it's a deletes metadata from

1550
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:21,009
pictures but not from other documents

1551
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:25,040
with that in mind we've all said so

1552
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:26,710
utilize in the oh the overlap in between

1553
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:29,239
physical world and virtual worlds

1554
01:40:26,710 --> 01:40:31,820
usually when you set up your office

1555
01:40:29,239 --> 01:40:34,730
server old windows rather you have a

1556
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:37,099
username and here's something that you

1557
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:40,159
will something that describes your site

1558
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:42,679
and they will say hello covers but most

1559
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:50,210
applications were the word or PDF it

1560
01:40:42,679 --> 01:40:53,960
embeds it and so here let's see here for

1561
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:58,130
example you see how on the top of it you

1562
01:40:53,960 --> 01:41:03,980
have the app the author of all files and

1563
01:40:58,130 --> 01:41:06,800
with this name this Arabic this is a

1564
01:41:03,980 --> 01:41:09,349
headline when it's been change and with

1565
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:12,500
that trying to gather information number

1566
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:14,090
of users and then different social media

1567
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:17,170
with the different apps that we are

1568
01:41:14,090 --> 01:41:20,860
familiar with and that's

1569
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:23,770
how we find out other social media where

1570
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:28,420
the NICUs is used doesn't mean that this

1571
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:31,570
is the evil bad guy here but this is an

1572
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:33,580
indication that will help us and with

1573
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:37,870
that you can have an email address and

1574
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:41,350
maybe access to other services and then

1575
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:43,390
all around the environment and the

1576
01:41:41,350 --> 01:41:48,010
setting it's about pulling the thread

1577
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:51,060
once again connecting the dots as it is

1578
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:54,910
says let me give you another example

1579
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:56,980
often when you're on a channel or medium

1580
01:41:54,910 --> 01:42:00,849
and looking for a profile you come

1581
01:41:56,980 --> 01:42:02,730
across information which visually isn't

1582
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:05,469
useful anymore

1583
01:42:02,730 --> 01:42:09,428
magnetic could use could be used here

1584
01:42:05,469 --> 01:42:12,810
but visually we realize that after an

1585
01:42:09,429 --> 01:42:15,940
attack in the family say in France

1586
01:42:12,810 --> 01:42:19,750
there's this medium that posted a

1587
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:22,089
picture well a piece of news I didn't

1588
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:25,300
know whether you can say I see that but

1589
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:29,070
if you check out the picture it is not a

1590
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:32,020
photograph it's not been done bloated

1591
01:42:29,070 --> 01:42:34,540
but it's not been downloaded from the

1592
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:37,000
internet it was just a home TV picture

1593
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:46,810
so they've taken it from their home to

1594
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:50,080
be and that's a Spanish TV and this was

1595
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:55,960
all Arab Arabic so one of the

1596
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:59,260
administrators is in Spain so we see the

1597
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:02,760
number of resources and social media

1598
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:02,760
that we need to come through

1599
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:10,880
so it is simpler to focus and some

1600
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:16,430
channels and we already said are there

1601
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:22,250
different kinds of channels one of which

1602
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:24,200
would be weapon sales I think I've said

1603
01:43:22,250 --> 01:43:26,810
it before it's not just about following

1604
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:28,670
targets was actually you need to try and

1605
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:30,440
be ahead of them and see how they work

1606
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:34,190
and how can you make the most of it and

1607
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:36,169
take some advantage and this looks like

1608
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:39,049
an ambulance right I don't really know

1609
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:39,530
why but it got my attention if I look at

1610
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:42,530
it

1611
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:49,610
in further detail I realized that it was

1612
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:52,130
from Granada so had been taken down to

1613
01:43:49,610 --> 01:43:54,320
Syria or Iraq or wherever the ambulance

1614
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,970
was but the same as with this one there

1615
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:59,179
was another one from Viteri in northern

1616
01:43:55,970 --> 01:44:01,250
Spain in case you don't know one of the

1617
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:03,380
systems they follow for attacks

1618
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:08,150
terrorist attacks would be a small one

1619
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:11,750
in a public space and emergency services

1620
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:15,200
go there to help victims and law

1621
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:17,720
enforcement and ambulances and they go

1622
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:20,630
investigate and there's a fake one it's

1623
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:23,870
a forgery filled with explosive and once

1624
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:26,510
the ambulance is there in the area they

1625
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:27,440
kill themselves and the damage is

1626
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:30,260
greater

1627
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:34,580
not just for civilians but mainly mainly

1628
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:36,470
military and police forces this is

1629
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:38,150
another example we've set it already

1630
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:40,520
this has to do with the hackers and

1631
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:43,940
there's a list as we said with

1632
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:47,500
vulnerable IPs where we can see there's

1633
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:52,160
the 60% that were very vulnerable to

1634
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:55,310
remote desk attacks and we could see

1635
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:58,900
there was the public company Korea red

1636
01:44:55,310 --> 01:45:01,790
and there were some that were with the

1637
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:04,639
ministry for defence and so we try to be

1638
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:07,610
proactive and these are data that we can

1639
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:10,490
use but when we got the this information

1640
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:13,639
we reported so that they could check

1641
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:16,590
whether those IPS will probably set up

1642
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:21,210
you know that you avoid other problems

1643
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:24,060
we've talked about Twitter and telegram

1644
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:26,190
but let's talk about Facebook sometimes

1645
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:30,870
it's not just what we said before it's

1646
01:45:26,190 --> 01:45:34,070
not just using tools while this was a

1647
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:37,890
dissemination activity in 2017 the

1648
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:41,880
French authorities were searching for

1649
01:45:37,890 --> 01:45:44,250
this person we've just crushed out they

1650
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:48,150
redacted the name because they thought

1651
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:52,320
it would he was a conflict returnee and

1652
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:56,070
there was a threat and after this first

1653
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:59,280
picture I tried to find information on

1654
01:45:56,070 --> 01:46:01,740
several social medium here I found a

1655
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:05,670
piece of information that I found was

1656
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:11,370
him interesting on Facebook so this is

1657
01:46:05,670 --> 01:46:14,730
the picture and it might seem that is

1658
01:46:11,370 --> 01:46:17,309
quite dissimilar to the person right but

1659
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:18,900
if you pay closer attention what we

1660
01:46:17,310 --> 01:46:21,960
realize is that the picture by the

1661
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:26,820
French authorities is just a cut-off of

1662
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:30,300
the profile Facebook picture so at least

1663
01:46:26,820 --> 01:46:33,150
we know that this Facebook profile is

1664
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:34,770
what they are looking after that's what

1665
01:46:33,150 --> 01:46:38,280
the French authorities are looking at

1666
01:46:34,770 --> 01:46:41,010
before sorry we keep on on social media

1667
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:43,650
and we find another profile quite

1668
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:46,380
similar but not clear about it different

1669
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:50,490
name different location different

1670
01:46:46,380 --> 01:46:52,890
country so it's not just about using

1671
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:56,210
tools but also the expertise and

1672
01:46:52,890 --> 01:47:01,650
analysis techniques we have three

1673
01:46:56,210 --> 01:47:03,780
pictures here's we might say that this

1674
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:06,900
is what I have and this is the same

1675
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:11,179
person and this is the Facebook profile

1676
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:13,349
and this is what's published by the

1677
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:14,940
French authorities this from the right

1678
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:16,740
side are the overlapping ones are the

1679
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:18,549
same so we give this here

1680
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:22,239
so if we start

1681
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:27,849
again we can see some features we see

1682
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:29,549
there is a freckle right above the

1683
01:47:27,849 --> 01:47:33,429
eyebrow

1684
01:47:29,550 --> 01:47:34,510
well it seems it could help us identify

1685
01:47:33,429 --> 01:47:40,590
him

1686
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:46,030
so both left and right pictures show an

1687
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:49,809
interesting eyebrow end and if we check

1688
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:52,329
another feature another freckle or a

1689
01:47:49,809 --> 01:47:57,099
mole next to the nose we see there is a

1690
01:47:52,329 --> 01:48:01,599
perfect match and without a expertise

1691
01:47:57,099 --> 01:48:05,440
forensic report so we might still see

1692
01:48:01,599 --> 01:48:08,920
that this is the same person and also

1693
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:11,500
the the the kind of the beard and it's

1694
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:13,389
an indication this is Van Dyck veers an

1695
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:17,409
indication and why is it so interesting

1696
01:48:13,389 --> 01:48:20,050
because in the profile he was using he

1697
01:48:17,409 --> 01:48:23,860
said that he was living in córdoba

1698
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:25,719
córdoba southern Spain so if he's on the

1699
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:29,679
run and had been living in Cordova it

1700
01:48:25,719 --> 01:48:32,409
might be that that's at a given point he

1701
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:38,860
could be in court about to try have

1702
01:48:32,409 --> 01:48:42,460
support from his friends and kin they

1703
01:48:38,860 --> 01:48:46,869
for suppose did Bitcoin addresses not

1704
01:48:42,460 --> 01:48:49,449
usual but sometimes they do publish it

1705
01:48:46,869 --> 01:48:53,980
in order to try and get some funding as

1706
01:48:49,449 --> 01:48:58,360
you know a bitcoin is traceable and with

1707
01:48:53,980 --> 01:49:00,459
that what we do is learning that account

1708
01:48:58,360 --> 01:49:02,409
where does it get the money from

1709
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:05,940
what other accounts are feeding it and

1710
01:49:02,409 --> 01:49:05,940
as you can see from for

1711
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:14,830
here we have the character flow or

1712
01:49:11,620 --> 01:49:18,460
string brother and even if we don't see

1713
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:22,540
the income deadlines or times but still

1714
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:25,960
four check for cut from four times they

1715
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:29,560
got money coming in so if we see the

1716
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:32,200
arrow they paid back to the so called

1717
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:36,640
mother account starting with a fifteen

1718
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:39,280
if we do look into the other accounts I

1719
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:41,800
don't know if you can see but those have

1720
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:44,290
a circle where the first account that

1721
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:47,110
paid to the mother can but each of these

1722
01:49:44,290 --> 01:49:51,090
accounts in turn has gotten money or has

1723
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:54,400
withdrawn money which indicates walked

1724
01:49:51,090 --> 01:49:58,090
we all know and we said it at the

1725
01:49:54,400 --> 01:50:00,519
beginning you might have used social

1726
01:49:58,090 --> 01:50:02,680
media or an alias that even if you

1727
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:05,380
change in three sub history there's a

1728
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:08,440
background but so you've tried to

1729
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:10,570
analyze I even have it on Facebook but

1730
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:13,299
you can also have searchers in different

1731
01:50:10,570 --> 01:50:15,759
areas different places to try and see if

1732
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:18,960
any of this has been published and from

1733
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:22,320
there try to D anonymizer first possible

1734
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:24,940
this kind of a transaction in the end

1735
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:27,580
well this is all about is trying to

1736
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:29,830
weather with magnetic in it team for

1737
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,790
leagues or whatever the type of

1738
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:35,440
mechanism

1739
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:40,360
it's about finding with same as with the

1740
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:41,530
Oh st. or sacrament or you mint these

1741
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:43,960
are techniques they will always be

1742
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:47,230
complementary it will be a support but

1743
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:51,850
it might help us get some clues and

1744
01:50:47,230 --> 01:50:56,620
science show in to us the light to try

1745
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:59,890
and find a profile or Trainmen and

1746
01:50:56,620 --> 01:51:02,230
monitor some items to be proactive and

1747
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:07,450
not wait just wait for that kind of

1748
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:10,559
attacks or threats anything else

1749
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:14,970
think we're doing right in time okay

1750
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,970
yeah and we've nail it haven't we

1751
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:29,560
so this is what we wanted to say there's

1752
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:33,450
not just about social media but actually

1753
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:36,190
it's a matter of time dedication and so

1754
01:51:33,450 --> 01:51:40,389
we need to understand that we need to

1755
01:51:36,190 --> 01:51:43,960
use tools and methodologies but also our

1756
01:51:40,390 --> 01:51:46,390
analyst skills is important to try and

1757
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:48,910
distract that because that would end

1758
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:52,180
with that product that is then finally

1759
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:53,430
delivered as we know for us thank you

1760
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:58,970
very much for your attendance

1761
