1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
you

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:08,400
[Music]

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,129
Manuel para pasar boom buenas tardes a

4
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:20,630
todos muchas gracias por good afternoon

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:24,830
thank you for being here I would like to

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:28,909
thank you before inviting me to be here

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:32,299
let's begin what am I going to speak

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,400
about introduction to NVT are you

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,669
familiar with this concept do you know

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:42,860
what it means it's a gay that's well

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:46,550
we're here industrial devices my talk

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:49,070
will be focused and on industrial topics

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:53,089
maybe you come from the IT world we'll

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:56,860
focus on operations how are we going to

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,860
create the envy tease

16
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,339
we're going to have envy tears

17
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:11,399
everywhere industrial Envy tees and then

18
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,210
demos that's what everybody likes we'll

19
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,549
have fun

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,210
I've already been introduced but I would

21
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,390
just wanted to say them a consultant at

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,048
s-21 SEC Nextel I have some

23
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,830
certifications international

24
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,869
certifications related to cyber security

25
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:36,720
industrial cybersecurity and I work with

26
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:40,229
the CCI what's an n VT there are network

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,140
vulnerability tests tear tests with

28
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:47,549
which we can obtain evidence about

29
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:52,280
vulnerabilities and aspects that allow

30
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,630
us to use exploits they're written in

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,030
NASL language which is necessary

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,949
scripting language that allow us to

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,440
check the existence of vulnerabilities

34
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,349
why are we using NASL or instead of

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,470
python or any other scripting language

36
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:13,440
which is available in the market and

37
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:16,099
many of you are familiar with basically

38
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,519
because it was designed for this purpose

39
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:23,369
entities developed with NASL because

40
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:27,120
NASL was developed noted to do envy

41
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:31,950
tears it saves time with compared to

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:35,760
other script languages and there's a

43
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,549
control on the code so weekend

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,980
revenge that someone injects some

45
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,020
malware malicious code malfunctioning

46
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:47,019
within our code everything is really

47
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,920
very controlled unless we create a

48
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:54,930
package but that would be in purpose for

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:03:03,149
a more advanced testing why do we use it

50
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:03,150
use them why are we going to use env T's

51
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:12,040
because of fat and sad tests are you

52
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:15,330
familiar with this type of tests fat

53
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,790
tests are tests carried out before

54
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:21,490
implementing a technology in a

55
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:24,640
production environment earlier our

56
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:27,870
facility and such tests are carried out

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:33,299
once the device has been installed and

58
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,300
production is working smoothly

59
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,459
why because we're reduced times when it

60
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,010
comes to obtain vulnerabilities we can

61
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:48,489
ultimate eyes execution of tests we can

62
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:52,359
create procedures and we can create

63
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:57,220
stress tests and fuzzing we'll see this

64
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:02,430
later on we will create packages in

65
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:07,989
order to simulate detect abnormalities

66
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:12,400
abnormal behaviors etc who uses &

67
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:17,079
veatch's well I understand that you may

68
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,048
be familiar with open vas yes yeah I see

69
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,890
some people who knows about this it's a

70
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:28,780
platform or two rather

71
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:30,560
useful to obtain information about the

72
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,280
vulnerabilities you can analyze an

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:39,230
environment and network etc why am I

74
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,789
using showing the number of invitees so

75
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,860
that you can see that as an active

76
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,710
community that develops type of tests

77
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,150
I'm not a crazy guy got up here to speak

78
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,919
about Nvidia's there are many people

79
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,750
working with this and they're very good

80
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:56,720
I guess you are familiar with tenable

81
00:04:52,750 --> 00:05:01,840
they also develop nvt they're quite a

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:06,800
few and which is developed by tenable in

83
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,770
their industrial area they had 301

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,320
plugins there were developments they use

85
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:17,570
Python for some things they have

86
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:21,688
powerful platforms these two have 300

87
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:24,469
and r1 plugins and now they have 6,000

88
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:24,469
just

89
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:31,780
from an industrial point of view I'm

90
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:36,640
sure there are many others then you have

91
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:41,489
search and gene engines you can search

92
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,490
for envy dissipated on different aspects

93
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:56,680
where since we're speaking about open

94
00:05:44,110 --> 00:06:01,410
vast this is how its structured these

95
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:04,980
are customers visual customers we can

96
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:11,380
set up the service so we are running

97
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:13,960
administrative manager and scanner we

98
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,830
set up all this these cans will want to

99
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:23,080
carry out we refine them we fine-tune

100
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:26,140
them and we set our goals results and

101
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:29,080
configurations of course we have manager

102
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:33,880
and Venus trader they shed data and D

103
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:38,169
and the scanners feed and envy teeth the

104
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,930
tester have to carry out the NVT tells

105
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:44,020
you what you have to do and how it's

106
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,660
been developed by ourselves or whoever

107
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,450
'yes we can his entities developed by

108
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:52,240
other people

109
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:55,510
environments noted to develop NVT at the

110
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:01,630
beginning when I started developing and

111
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:06,219
VT I saw that you can use fame Nano old

112
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:13,120
school or you can use sublime notepad

113
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:15,210
plus plus for comments loops structures

114
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:26,230
of the scripting language itself

115
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:28,239
descriptions as a tool you can check did

116
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,640
have four tenable they have all the

117
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,940
tools there and some others that you can

118
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:37,590
use in order to promote your development

119
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,590
that they're not so burdensome

120
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:44,790
you can use any editor but it's nice to

121
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:53,200
have things in different colors

122
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:55,330
structure etc industrial devices are you

123
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:01,030
familiar with industrial world I see

124
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:05,229
some people that do peeled C's allow us

125
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:08,530
to automate is they have in digital and

126
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:13,960
analog input and output they can have

127
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:15,760
one or more the plc was born in order to

128
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,690
automate eyes instead of doing things

129
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:24,789
manually it was willing to be faster and

130
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:26,920
in Syria in a serial way rtu and are

131
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,130
some sort of peeled see but they're

132
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,130
different

133
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:42,409
this is seen in places with no one

134
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:46,930
continuous administration this there's

135
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:51,620
no operator continuous operate there and

136
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:56,709
then H M is human-machine interfaces

137
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:59,270
they show information the operator and

138
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:03,380
the operator can interact with the

139
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:06,040
process in order to regulate some

140
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,040
measures

141
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:18,660
actions to be carried out more pressure

142
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:21,360
less pressure whatever and a very famous

143
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,790
system in industrial water this scatter

144
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,600
system I think they mentioned in the

145
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,079
yesterday

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,530
this type of system carries out

147
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:34,770
supervisory actions they allow you to

148
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:37,350
centralize signals so the approaches can

149
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:40,260
have the logics of a process in a single

150
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,100
room and they contact operators they

151
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,810
decide whether there's some sort of

152
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,700
abnormality the process and they keep

153
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,459
the system available in an industrial

154
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,300
world availability is very important in

155
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:58,460
every work carried out in the industry

156
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:00,959
is aimed at maintaining availability and

157
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:04,520
this type of environments protection of

158
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,520
people is very important

159
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,780
in a robotic arm if you get a virus

160
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,000
probably it will move very quickly and

161
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,959
it may even kill a person you have to

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,750
bear this in mind and they communicate

163
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:25,150
with many devices located different

164
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:27,570
places PLC rtu HMI

165
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:29,930
[Music]

166
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:34,230
there are different levels of

167
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:39,899
automatisation and devices instruments

168
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:44,160
networks where you can find PLC's you

169
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:46,139
need to see how this is going to evolve

170
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,199
we're going to speak about the different

171
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,540
parts so that you know what we're

172
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:53,339
speaking about scattered level two of

173
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,279
committees automatisation which is

174
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:59,459
supervisory network level three mesh

175
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:07,060
systems operation networks and level 4

176
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:11,319
this woody focused on IT we have LRT

177
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,819
you've seen the parent for now the

178
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,760
network level we're going to see where

179
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,420
every device is it what each device is

180
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,460
located

181
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:24,339
perhaps you used to cooperate a network

182
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:27,540
where you can find many devices we have

183
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:32,740
at home for example right now

184
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:36,939
mobile phones printers we may share

185
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:40,450
files in the network or computers but

186
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:43,650
then we will focus on the test will be

187
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:51,280
carried out will take place at control

188
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:55,120
network level remote rtu PLC and level

189
00:11:51,280 --> 00:12:01,890
to automatisation HMI supervision

190
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,890
SCADA software industrial software etc

191
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:15,750
this is the scope of our testing these

192
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:18,450
devices were these vices found a lot

193
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:24,000
located in the network so how do we

194
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:28,199
create an and VT so you need to have

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,139
some fundamentals to create an envy T so

196
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:33,139
we have first of all a knowledge base

197
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:41,850
with which we can interact through a

198
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,029
number of functions then I will tell you

199
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,209
where all the documents are available

200
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:51,870
for you to check all the possible

201
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:54,839
functions and this knowledge base is

202
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:58,110
kind of like our brain that we will be

203
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:01,410
feeding with information so that we have

204
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,000
an understanding of our device so that

205
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,380
we can find out about its

206
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,320
vulnerabilities imagine that I feel our

207
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:15,269
NVT with information it is like a card

208
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:18,720
and I put all the information in of the

209
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:24,360
cards into my brain then I create second

210
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:26,970
and VT and then I relate me and then a

211
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,880
very important concept when it comes to

212
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:33,779
creating an VT is the following if I

213
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,779
create MV t1 and then if I introduce if

214
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,689
I fill it in with information this is

215
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:42,329
information that I kind of use in the

216
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:45,480
very same and VT so that means that I

217
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:49,890
have to link the various entities so in

218
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,079
MV t1 I detect that port 80 is open but

219
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:55,949
it is also vulnerable because it has

220
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,609
whatever Apache version and that

221
00:13:55,949 --> 00:14:03,079
information a sec cannot

222
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:08,810
we used in the entry team but instead I

223
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:12,079
have to create MVT number two to use

224
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:15,140
that information so that is to say the

225
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:19,310
everyday scanner use information that

226
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:27,589
they are fed with well I hope that

227
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:34,459
everyone has understood me so I hope

228
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:38,040
that you can follow okay okay so did you

229
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:41,689
get us a cake it

230
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,660
now documentation where can you find

231
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:50,840
documentation and information to develop

232
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:54,630
MVC's so we have the open vs then also

233
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,970
nasi reference manual or you can check

234
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,750
all the loops on the structures or the

235
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,750
languages

236
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:12,699
so just for tips check if there is an

237
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:16,300
existing and VT so you don't really want

238
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:18,910
to waste your time so if someone has

239
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,269
developed an MV t you may improve it

240
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,300
with information in it so that you can

241
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:29,339
create a second one perhaps the most

242
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:31,300
powerful one or well a different MVC

243
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,060
drawing and building upon the

244
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,660
information on MPT number one then

245
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,819
including all dependencies and

246
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,949
requirements of our code what are the

247
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,440
dependencies that my enmity will have

248
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:48,939
for instance open ports or I need a

249
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:52,029
specific tool later on we'll see that we

250
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:56,230
may use different supported tools then

251
00:15:52,029 --> 00:16:00,070
also being aware of the q OG that is to

252
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:03,690
say quality of detection quality of the

253
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:08,230
detection will be discussed later on and

254
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:15,069
that will mean that what our NVT may

255
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:21,370
have 80% or 90% level of quality then

256
00:16:15,069 --> 00:16:25,810
use an updated templates enmities always

257
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:28,949
have the same structure we'll look at

258
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,949
that later on

259
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,680
so if you have an updated structure and

260
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:42,020
the structure that you improve on the

261
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:45,989
daily basis it will be easier for you to

262
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:48,149
use all the information and enmities

263
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:52,529
that will be available when every one

264
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:57,920
that really appears then using tools

265
00:16:52,529 --> 00:17:00,839
such as Wireshark web browsing proxies

266
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,859
to better understand communications and

267
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:07,829
for better reproduction of them you may

268
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:11,188
resist capture information with

269
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:14,938
Wireshark through cut and paste and you

270
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:17,130
may send that information raw in raw so

271
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:19,650
as the interpreter is cutting and

272
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:23,339
pasting if you see that something is

273
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:25,890
generating and abnormal behavior of the

274
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:27,958
recent denial of service you just cut

275
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,110
and paste it and you send it in and

276
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,480
that's it it's already created as simple

277
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:37,229
as that information to be taken into

278
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,830
account there is an identifier so this

279
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:44,429
is structure for you to create a new MVT

280
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:48,780
I don't just don't have time to go into

281
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:52,350
greater detail and now choose that are

282
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:58,490
to be taking into account to develop and

283
00:17:52,350 --> 00:18:02,939
MVT well you may use a pass tenable

284
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:07,770
again scripting language a language so

285
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,670
they so they all have these cunning

286
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:13,500
options

287
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:16,470
the idea is to scan and what get more

288
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,630
information also you have to be aware of

289
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,520
existing libraries for you to implement

290
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,990
your own code you may create your own

291
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,800
functions improve existing libraries

292
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:31,590
create new libraries

293
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:36,379
tools when you want to create regular

294
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:38,760
expressions that are often very powerful

295
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:43,050
while you may use this one which is

296
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:47,730
quite safe just fall and then well there

297
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:53,879
are tools available there such as as an

298
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:55,860
MP CAD or as an MP walk well and say oh

299
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,750
this is really interesting okay

300
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:04,500
therefore I would send you more about it

301
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:11,190
so our friends were quite shocked also

302
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:14,809
the proxies Pescara up and we also have

303
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:18,270
those sectors like kites high or newer

304
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:20,460
running under and map as well as regular

305
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,370
expressions and as well as many others

306
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:29,010
this is the interpreter we are going to

307
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:32,159
use so it is not for us to plot it to

308
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,690
open visor to any other tool because you

309
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,520
will have to assign them so therefore

310
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:39,090
let us take advantage of the existing

311
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,500
interpreter for quick testing which is

312
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,740
not only the objective of these

313
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:48,990
presentations but also of the our

314
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,610
testing then quality of detection under

315
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:56,090
left

316
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:58,649
you see the value of a remote banner I

317
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:06,689
didn't know that you can read her nose

318
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:09,629
but here is this remote banner is 80% so

319
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,460
this is a screenshot of Lunars website

320
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:18,179
where there are several feeds of

321
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:23,279
Auvergne abilities exploits etc and it

322
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:27,450
has been filtered through open vas and

323
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:34,490
these are all for detection so because

324
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:34,490
industry prioritizes detection

325
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:40,580
somebody want to have this directory of

326
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,970
assets so for you to be aware of the

327
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:46,490
available devices so being aware of all

328
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,820
the devices in your industrial facility

329
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:53,620
is not easy and many companies do not

330
00:20:49,820 --> 00:21:00,860
have an updated directory of devices I

331
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:06,080
wouldn't say that all companies lacking

332
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:12,459
that type of register but very many so

333
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:14,899
that's why detection is of high priority

334
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,419
we should take into account a minimum

335
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:21,730
percentage of quality of detection has

336
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:24,710
been set as 60% before it goes into

337
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:27,020
report so this is an important

338
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,799
characteristic so if you want to include

339
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:34,280
your invitees which have quality of

340
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:40,280
detection below 70 will not be in the

341
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:45,110
report so if you come figure your scan

342
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:49,399
and then you get a good summary presence

343
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:53,149
in PDF format who any other formats it

344
00:21:49,400 --> 00:22:00,169
will not be included in that report

345
00:21:53,149 --> 00:22:00,168
promote banner 80% quality of detection

346
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:09,449
now scripting with and map some

347
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:16,020
industrial examples these are specific

348
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:21,990
industrial protocols magnetic in smart

349
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:26,970
buildings mod boosts very widely spread

350
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:31,770
as seven proprietary from Siemens and a

351
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:34,440
nip and SP use by Allen party and other

352
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:37,168
manufacturers this is a JIT hub of

353
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,000
digital bond including these scripts as

354
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:43,230
well as many others you can play around

355
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,320
with them go through and map careful

356
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:50,029
with what you go to because if it is

357
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,580
real industrial device you may get into

358
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:58,080
big trouble

359
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:59,520
so signing and we tease this is for you

360
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,639
to note that when you want to include

361
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,110
your everything - - you have to sign it

362
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,630
otherwise the tool will tell you that

363
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,189
you are not authorized to run it at the

364
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,190
end of the day there is always some kind

365
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:15,179
of control

366
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:22,850
so both the code and running of you and

367
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:22,850
VT is controlled so GPG up

368
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:30,750
now elements to take into consideration

369
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:35,290
for development of industrial invitees

370
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:41,020
possibility of sent out poorly created

371
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:43,030
threats for a stress testing it is

372
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:46,770
always advisable to run this type of

373
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:49,149
tests in labs never under production

374
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,220
well because if it were to do that you

375
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,860
could be in big trouble

376
00:23:51,220 --> 00:24:01,630
then unstable services that do not

377
00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:03,909
respond to some queries sometimes

378
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,880
industrial devices may not keep up the

379
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:09,850
life cycle of communication they may go

380
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,150
down they may go on and off they may be

381
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:15,370
a bit unstable so we have to take that

382
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:19,360
into account if your MVT tells you that

383
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:23,229
pert 161 should be open perhaps that

384
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,110
service will be very unstable that very

385
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:30,700
same device I may tell you that it is no

386
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:38,340
robot but it may be actually open so

387
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:42,610
using the same MBT for scanning of whole

388
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:46,810
network okay use them one by one and

389
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:51,419
with care when you use open visor necess

390
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:55,960
please notice all the plugins families

391
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:58,260
so you have to take it easy and then the

392
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,360
left cycle of sockets

393
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,760
and that of the actual communication

394
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,100
sometimes the life cycle doesn't last

395
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,600
very long or the device does not make

396
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,840
proper interpretation of the

397
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,649
communication and then availability

398
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:17,020
comes first in the industry some MDT's

399
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:23,050
have an impact on the availability of

400
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:26,080
the device so you may be aware of as low

401
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:29,139
lily's there and it opens up sockets

402
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,850
cetera so we have to be very very

403
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:37,890
careful with that and as I said before

404
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:42,070
carry out these testing in ups not and

405
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:45,010
production so what a helpful locks but

406
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:47,950
these two ones of the voters are about

407
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:50,379
what am I very helpful because here in

408
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:54,220
open vast amenities we will have

409
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:59,320
information about objectives the time

410
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:02,500
where the NVT was launched but the most

411
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,230
important one will be the open the dump

412
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:08,140
here we will have a log of scanning

413
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:10,420
errors and messages but messages all

414
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,630
three display means that there is a

415
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,840
function inside open vast dump where

416
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:21,610
what you can do printf or any other

417
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:25,149
command where you can comment and say

418
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:29,669
well this is happening here and then you

419
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,670
will get that later on in your log

420
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,950
when you go through your script you take

421
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:39,760
a look at the different steps okay oh it

422
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:42,730
doesn't go into the loop or it does it

423
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,710
is not calling the function alright so

424
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:53,590
some examples from industrial enmities I

425
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:58,510
like to separate that in three so this M

426
00:26:53,590 --> 00:27:03,970
DT is associated with Siemens so this is

427
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:08,800
copyright and this is the description

428
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:13,809
that you could get in the tools that we

429
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:15,220
are not very interested in dad's jet if

430
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:18,129
you have any questions about it please

431
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:23,770
ask me later on and this is what we are

432
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:28,870
interested in the code so this time we

433
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:31,679
were detecting FTP we check the regular

434
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:37,800
expression and that was associated with

435
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:41,830
Siemens somatic so this is for detection

436
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:46,000
PPS based it is zero and thus it then

437
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:50,590
schneider same procedures structure this

438
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,230
is what we are interested in well sir

439
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,820
this is a vulnerability for command

440
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,679
injection but the only thing that checks

441
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,678
here is the version and then it says

442
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:01,809
this version is vulnerable doesn't do an

443
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:08,530
actual injection if you want to do the

444
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:10,059
injection we will base that on our CBS s

445
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:13,928
and I said well this is vulnerable I'm

446
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:17,950
going to inject it with my code so the

447
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:20,200
CBS s is of 10 this time this is very

448
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,210
important at industrial level because

449
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,640
with a denial of service for instance

450
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:30,250
imagine that it has been classified as 6

451
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:32,830
and you can be make something going out

452
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:35,860
of production so therefore you have to

453
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:41,110
be very careful to see what it's black

454
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:42,459
teen but is the power system Sanders

455
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,250
repair system

456
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:49,929
he receives at the tire of service to

457
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:55,240
maybe powering off hundreds of

458
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:59,850
industrial devices so you may be may

459
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:03,549
create like a huge travel now

460
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:07,889
communications there also invitees for

461
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:11,679
communications this is the detection of

462
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:18,660
Ethernet and inserted threads that you

463
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:21,910
may send well I don't have to go through

464
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,860
all of it so we'll have the section of

465
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:28,230
the product the code of the product

466
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:33,340
manufacturer type of device the

467
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:35,410
revisions so we get information this

468
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:42,270
time through Ethernet protocol and now

469
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:42,270
lemon this the part that you most like

470
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,730
so I brought a video with me because

471
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,049
it's just impossible for me to bring all

472
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,049
these devices

473
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:12,620
so this is a map scanning for you to see

474
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:22,779
available ports then we get information

475
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:22,779
so different protocols Ethernet IP

476
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,230
so this is what we saw before

477
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,820
so because we are doing backward time I

478
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,159
will move on so here you see how

479
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:49,000
interacts with the actual sister this is

480
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:51,580
scanning MAC addresses associated with

481
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,090
Siemens and then we start to see strange

482
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:59,799
things says that the manufacturer device

483
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:01,659
has been manufactured by Rockwell not a

484
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:08,770
part of his routine this time with

485
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:12,360
protocol s7 so this is for you to see

486
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,360
the output of this script

487
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:22,450
now obtaining information interaction

488
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,450
with it or information now

489
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,880
but the system is technolon this is the

490
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:36,559
serial number identifying in this

491
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:38,420
facility then scripting and obtaining

492
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,460
information before you attack something

493
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,950
you really need to know where you are

494
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,230
and especially in industrial

495
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:48,290
environments it is not only about

496
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:53,000
attacking but it is about being accurate

497
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:55,659
in your attack so if you have been

498
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,900
offensive you just don't want to recut

499
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:06,650
so these are the slaves associated with

500
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:13,910
a device in Modbus slaves and we running

501
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:17,860
our MV T's these are linked and V T's so

502
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,860
here we see some dependencies

503
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:30,000
- excess is asking you to run it

504
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:34,050
these pilotis has been centered not so

505
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,520
we have sport because I really need to

506
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:39,270
know but that there are open ports or

507
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:47,910
not I want to go what about the version

508
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:50,570
that is being used and final MVC which

509
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:54,600
shows here on the screen and then the

510
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:59,270
objective 192 I just don't want to be

511
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,270
attacked by anyone on the Internet

512
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:13,220
this one takes a while so I tried I

513
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:13,220
tried to first to bypass it a little bit

514
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:20,639
more and inform a Theon I love honest I

515
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,850
know where test 400 we have some

516
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,150
information here that some Nvidia's

517
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,889
which are slower the ones who go through

518
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:32,910
VT and it's because of this because

519
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:36,870
perhaps were using tools which is nmap

520
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:39,380
and that's why years lower so a bit

521
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,379
faster

522
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:54,720
did it detect the immunity yes if you

523
00:33:48,820 --> 00:34:00,939
see here you see set keys it sets

524
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:04,360
information it's setting the cave the

525
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:17,290
one we've mentioned or sorry the KB

526
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:21,250
we've mentioned before the IEDs have the

527
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:25,029
wrong ID yeah there are some tables we

528
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:28,960
have the manufacturer's name etc using

529
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:33,149
this tool I try to explain the tools and

530
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:36,940
then use them I got information from the

531
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:39,098
manufacture the module in which it is

532
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:43,030
and this is a mod post development

533
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:46,659
because we want to carry on carry out

534
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:55,629
tests we're going to create packages and

535
00:34:46,659 --> 00:35:01,630
let's see how it interpret is it a la

536
00:34:55,629 --> 00:35:04,180
respuesta this is the what was response

537
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:07,960
I just have 15 minutes left

538
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:10,290
I'll go quite fast here then I'll get

539
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,099
into detail in the most technical part

540
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:16,690
here with creating I have this slide I'm

541
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:19,030
going to show you later on so don't

542
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:22,240
worry what you can see here is that the

543
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:25,660
device is not responding properly so

544
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,910
it's either badly implemented or there's

545
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,890
something going on have you seen

546
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:32,399
anything I don't know what I'll explain

547
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,400
later on

548
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:43,349
so more requests what I want to do is

549
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:57,779
analyzing the behavior of my device so I

550
00:35:43,349 --> 00:36:02,640
do things I change the values etc these

551
00:35:57,779 --> 00:36:04,319
are mod book Modbus requests most

552
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:18,900
awesome asperger son diferentes provides

553
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:23,579
every Mo's so a bit faster another end

554
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:30,809
VT but this is too much it's a honey but

555
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:33,450
yes you've said you cannot read it very

556
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:39,259
well from there but it says compose how

557
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:45,210
it's game so something important

558
00:36:39,259 --> 00:36:48,720
this is display I included so that we

559
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:51,329
know the ending point of the code I

560
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,680
wanted to explain everything and now get

561
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:59,940
it into practice

562
00:36:52,680 --> 00:37:03,180
I hope it's interesting so now that we

563
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:07,710
have so much information we're going to

564
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:09,520
put this into the R K beam this is our

565
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:13,180
tool

566
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,520
it carries a request with s7 protocol

567
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:18,430
different communications and what we try

568
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,470
to do it's knowing what device is behind

569
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:22,720
this because very often you're given an

570
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:26,250
IP but you don't know what's out there

571
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,250
you don't know anything

572
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,350
sometime sometimes it's not even

573
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:35,350
communicating perhaps it's an industrial

574
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:38,410
device which only generates a signal

575
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:41,259
when you switched on it's complex I just

576
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:45,520
want to I just wanted to see the whole

577
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:50,110
procedure and what are we doing at

578
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:54,150
motorist level we're setting our code in

579
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:58,360
order to read the identifier of the

580
00:37:54,150 --> 00:38:00,670
device I need to know what device or

581
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:04,600
speaking about Walmart why do I know

582
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:06,720
that it's Antarctic in the instructing

583
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,700
in their own way we are requesting this

584
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,939
we're sending this request this was one

585
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:16,480
of the threats and there are different

586
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:20,490
things you can use I'm using 10:10 it's

587
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:24,970
not there therefore if it does not exist

588
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:26,859
the answer according to the Modbus

589
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,730
logics the way this protocol is

590
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:34,150
implemented I should be giving a failure

591
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:39,380
and it answers that everything is okay I

592
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:43,500
change the values and here it's saying

593
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:46,050
it's telling you the different objects

594
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:52,500
there are have three Siemens

595
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:56,580
semantics and s700 I'm going very

596
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:59,550
quickly over this so I apologize if you

597
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:03,930
have any doubt you can ask me later this

598
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:07,050
is the answer and here you see the

599
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:11,609
objects the IDS there are three objects

600
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:17,100
which are mandatory and the conformity

601
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:19,530
level it that shows you the way the

602
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,589
protocol works and B answer you need to

603
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:24,000
receive and burn all this in mind and

604
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:27,390
the fact that these three fields are

605
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,880
completely mandatory this is a wire

606
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:37,440
thread it could be copied and pasted and

607
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:42,180
you send it that's why using scripting

608
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:45,840
is very powerful this is the trick

609
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:48,750
Marvis this is the reference in our mode

610
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,030
person it's an open protocol so anyone

611
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:56,130
can see how this is implemented I know

612
00:39:51,030 --> 00:40:00,870
that the devices parameters ID are

613
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:06,209
wonderful here it says that if the value

614
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:09,449
is bigger than four you need to give me

615
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:12,959
you need to tell me that the data isn't

616
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:14,929
a fatty this is what everybody does so I

617
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:18,839
know there's something going on there

618
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:20,069
another idea at Network level which can

619
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:24,839
make me think that there's something

620
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:28,288
wrong going on here because he's saying

621
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:32,189
well this guy brought a comfort and you

622
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:34,199
know this is comfort but let's lay

623
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:37,379
communications it uses the same

624
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:39,479
structure in industrial devices nibs

625
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:43,079
which is their information and obtain

626
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:46,109
things to an SEM VP protocol nibs can be

627
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,409
private with the private nib you can get

628
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:53,189
more information and nibs change this

629
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:55,559
from the same family here this could be

630
00:40:53,189 --> 00:41:04,649
an industrial device but it makes me

631
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:06,209
think that something going on here this

632
00:41:04,649 --> 00:41:11,638
is mod boost is all the information we

633
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:13,408
got from the comfort in our KB we can

634
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,739
conclude that this is a honeypot and

635
00:41:13,409 --> 00:41:18,430
this is a raspberry with the motive and

636
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:20,470
mark

637
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,140
you know there's something weird going

638
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:25,538
on and you know that thanks to all this

639
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:28,569
you're entering information in our your

640
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:31,480
brain which would be the KB I thought it

641
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:35,200
was very interesting that masters in

642
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:40,650
misleading people he said ok HTML of

643
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:44,859
kompot has this and override he said

644
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:50,650
let's write something for it and he kept

645
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:52,839
the rest well great quite the master but

646
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:56,200
just it was just some interesting thing

647
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:58,299
and then here show them this is a query

648
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:02,890
you can send there are a thousand to

649
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:06,160
detect comfort but cherdon with its

650
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:08,170
platform detects this one I am sure

651
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,490
there are many others and their more

652
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:14,799
advanced honey pots that required deeper

653
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:21,399
study all these tests have been carried

654
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:25,299
out very quickly that was why using

655
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,099
script language NASL was so important

656
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:29,500
because it's quick this it's the real

657
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:33,670
device real industrial device and it's

658
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:38,079
very quick the video is very short of an

659
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:40,150
industrial device with specific

660
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,490
manufacturer no I'm not going to say it

661
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,520
because it's there let's leave it at

662
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:44,520
that

663
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:52,890
so you scan with map and map in

664
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:57,299
production that's something you should

665
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:59,779
never do and here I'm going to go old

666
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:03,920
school I'm going to use AZ open

667
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:08,819
communication and you send the request

668
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,480
get to you RL whatever and it answers

669
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,480
with that

670
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:29,089
and obtain is that it manufacturers said

671
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:32,430
UV that IV that's it so we move on he

672
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:36,270
investigates use other ports to get in

673
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:42,328
you improve your tests and when you find

674
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:44,700
the manufacturer you press and and you

675
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:47,089
go have a coffee and you go back to find

676
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:52,819
the vulnerabilities and your tags etc

677
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:56,310
this is the implementation from the NV t

678
00:43:52,819 --> 00:44:02,790
you need to check that port 80s open

679
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:04,980
your l request to port 80 this item

680
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:09,420
which is pretty and here is interpreted

681
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:11,579
the headers this is the body of the

682
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,339
message we will use a regular expression

683
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:18,079
here would just check that this content

684
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:21,569
is in the header we put it into the

685
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:27,930
display because we interesting hobby

686
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:31,269
that's and then you show it in KP I have

687
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:36,899
time this is

688
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:40,058
practical case I just wanted to show you

689
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:43,929
how in silver said with that warning

690
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:47,229
service creates a series of 1s related

691
00:44:43,929 --> 00:44:49,209
to industrial cybersecurity and I would

692
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:52,058
like to show you how you can implement

693
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:56,859
it very quickly this is the warning this

694
00:44:52,059 --> 00:45:01,689
is code says I have several not to check

695
00:44:56,859 --> 00:45:03,729
the release because it's quite easy this

696
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:07,839
one is three five eleven and here it

697
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:10,598
says I can barely read it it says before

698
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:14,038
three five thirteen so you know that

699
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:18,549
this to Elva are vulnerable therefore

700
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:21,489
what should we do now you need to check

701
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:24,749
how to follow the steps of the

702
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:27,779
explanation of the vulnerability you

703
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:32,140
need that release but you need those

704
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:34,899
components stay there if you check if

705
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:39,519
you search the internet you find things

706
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:44,740
these are shown parts and this component

707
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:47,379
is functionality

708
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:50,770
which is included in virtually every

709
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:53,050
code sets but you need to make sure that

710
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:57,940
it's that release and that it's using

711
00:45:53,050 --> 00:46:00,430
that so it's XML and perhaps it's not

712
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,089
available at Network level which may

713
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:10,060
make it complicated so you may say okay

714
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:14,170
I know the code sets is here I know but

715
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:18,279
I can know the release at that old level

716
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:20,200
and it stopped there because for this

717
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,589
you need to carry out an investigation

718
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:27,509
and you have no not enough time for that

719
00:46:23,589 --> 00:46:30,700
you're a consultant you're sent to our

720
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:34,589
company in you have a given period of

721
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:38,560
time in a device that's the game start

722
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:41,369
if you've carried out some automatized

723
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,950
tests we can't be ultimate eyes with the

724
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:48,570
scripting language with Python I thought

725
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,569
this was very interesting

726
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:58,060
you use this you press ENTER you carry

727
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:59,830
out elaborate tests you may have more

728
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:02,710
time for other things and that's always

729
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:03,910
a good idea and this was everything

730
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:11,510
thank you very much

731
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:11,509
[Applause]

732
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,060
you
