00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:08,379
you

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,379
[Music]

3
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:17,840
good morning how are you

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,310
I'd like to welcome you all and said

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,189
there are not many people here it's

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:24,650
complicated this is Sunday there's an

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:27,890
election going on Andalusia people have

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:31,398
left I think we have an interesting talk

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,200
ahead of us 3540 minutes this is the

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:38,180
last part of cyber camp

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:42,110
we're here to talk about our experience

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,480
as the Spanish team the last edition of

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:48,670
the european survey cyber security

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,010
challenge with made an analogy with

15
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:55,790
video game are you familiar with

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:59,809
battlefield this year was a particular

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:02,030
fight there were many difficulties the

18
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:05,600
talent has increased the number of

19
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,490
countries two people in the steering

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,710
committee and i would like say hello to

21
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:13,130
my colleague our years ago there were

22
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:15,559
many last-minute decisions changes the

23
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:18,469
rules of the game conflicts of interest

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,009
among countries say we serve a battle

25
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:23,869
for all of us and before starting i

26
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,959
would like to ask a question to your

27
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:29,810
audience how many of you have heard

28
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:35,959
about European cyber security challenge

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:40,039
before hands up about 75% of our room

30
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:42,560
those of you have just come in did you

31
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,929
live did you hear me have you heard

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,299
about the events I will give you a

33
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:53,210
challenge well today's talk

34
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:57,770
is inspirational and motivational top

35
00:01:53,210 --> 00:02:00,710
we're going to use one fellow and man

36
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,090
was an example to follow well

37
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,949
particularly for those who you the young

38
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,630
ones following us those of you who want

39
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,330
to be part of the Spanish team and we're

40
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,250
going to explain how you have to do it

41
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,680
you have the right place cyber camp

42
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,870
which is the classification stays in

43
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,250
order to become a member of the Spanish

44
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:25,549
team so without further ado we'll start

45
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:34,180
with a talk well I would like to

46
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:34,180
introduce Manuel Blanco aka rainy day

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,920
how did you started cybersecurity I was

48
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,030
quite young when I started like all of

49
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,879
us I was self-taught I was I thought I

50
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,950
was curious and little by little they

51
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,940
develop your skills you read whatever

52
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,619
you can you take part in Faro you

53
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,359
discuss with people in charge to

54
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:05,590
exchange opinions that was how I begun

55
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:10,069
and we also have Gonzalo earthy Leone

56
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:13,419
aka hands tapa and smooth he was third

57
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:16,849
he came up third last year in cyber camp

58
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:19,490
this year has been fighting and to the

59
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:25,209
last minute how do you start

60
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:31,820
in ETF I started last year at cyber camp

61
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:35,540
my first series CDF and in cybersecurity

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:39,709
was like one well I finished my studies

63
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,630
before finishing my studies I was

64
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:44,810
focusing in cybersecurity ethical

65
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:52,070
hacking and after that I was self-taught

66
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:55,000
I registered for a master's degree in IT

67
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,489
security but I wasn't convinced by it

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,960
usually when you finish your studies

69
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:03,380
they tell you that you need a master's

70
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:07,040
degree it's mandatory in order to become

71
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:10,370
someone to specialise I don't think so I

72
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,060
don't agree I think your personal work

73
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,399
in this space on my experience and the

74
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,829
experience of people around me the work

75
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,779
you do at home the interests you have

76
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,060
whatever your practice that's more

77
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,559
valuable than any degree well you've

78
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,530
raised an important point I would like

79
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,110
to ask you about the need to have a

80
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,760
technical degree in order to work in

81
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:36,590
this area the many self-taught people a

82
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,420
while ago there were no specific

83
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,940
training and people working in this were

84
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:45,260
self-taught but it's true that having a

85
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,900
technical degree gives you cross-cutting

86
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:51,050
knowledge and a basis after which you

87
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:55,520
can specialize your steering computing

88
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:58,190
in science and you know I've finished we

89
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:03,830
were speaking about this yesterday

90
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,750
I said that for me having my degree

91
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,940
provided me with the technical basis

92
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,920
which is very important that's what I

93
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,000
tell people all the time when they ask

94
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,280
me and what they tell me they want to be

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,410
hackers or cyborgs in cybersecurity I

96
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,150
always say the same thing it's a

97
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,430
cross-cutting knowledge it has to do

98
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,739
with every knowledge in IT what does it

99
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:29,810
mean if you're interested in web

100
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:32,390
security web hacking and wrapped him in

101
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,180
web apps or code analysis and web apps

102
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:39,110
first of all you need to be familiar

103
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,840
with our technology you cannot exploit a

104
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:45,500
vulnerability in PHP if you don't know

105
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,890
anything about PHP or you cannot do pen

106
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:54,410
testing and systems if you don't master

107
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:56,770
Linux or a Linux console from my point

108
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,040
of view I think it's not that important

109
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:03,219
perhaps it's a good way to have a good

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,690
theoretical foundations get Peters good

111
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,310
concepts it's one way to acquire this

112
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,710
knowledge

113
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:12,620
so if not yourself Tony cannot reach

114
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,659
those information sources here you you

115
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,510
have University it gives you your basis

116
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,340
but you can reach that knowledge

117
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,230
yourself total base is the most

118
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,130
important things that a person person

119
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,960
has passion and that the person learns

120
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:32,120
all the time so if you sort of answer

121
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:36,739
the next question we tend to go to in

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,840
theory conferences and they ask me how

123
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,100
can a specialist in cyber security today

124
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,320
the Internet provides you with the

125
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:48,830
necessary tools tutorials there are four

126
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,180
are many events in which you can get

127
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,919
into the community what would you

128
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,200
recommend to the youngest people that

129
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,750
are looking at us watching us today I

130
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,050
would recommend conferences when you're

131
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,050
starting

132
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,950
Cybercom rotate combi have all the talks

133
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:10,830
in the internet even though you don't

134
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:14,130
have the possibility to physically go

135
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,409
there 10 to the cumference there's

136
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:20,969
material in the internet and that's very

137
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,500
honest this is something really good

138
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,700
organizations are doing uploading all

139
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,210
this content for free and when we say

140
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:33,030
that we're self-taught we mean that we

141
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:36,390
use Google very well everything is there

142
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,270
just search in Google and when they

143
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:42,120
specialize well you filter the

144
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:45,900
information you want to obtain from

145
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:49,320
which field it's true and that came up

146
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:54,000
yesterday - let's imagine you know

147
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:58,550
nothing about cybersecurity I said I

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,530
tell you you need to self teach yourself

149
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,040
searching Google but what do a search

150
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,080
for hacking web you're going to see many

151
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:11,820
advertising material for many causes

152
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:15,680
that they want your money and then you

153
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:19,500
have lots of materials that are not

154
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,120
quality materials so that's why think

155
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,460
converses are important not just a

156
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,860
conference itself but also the people

157
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,440
you meet the people around you for me

158
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,650
that was one of the most valuable

159
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,580
sources of information so the community

160
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:37,890
you create yes so let's close this first

161
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,890
part of the conference which is

162
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,470
inspirational motivational we already

163
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:46,140
know your trajectories therefore our two

164
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,360
captains now let's speak about Spanish

165
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,970
team for those of you who are not

166
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,420
familiar this cyber camp allows in

167
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,460
theory to choose 10 people that go to

168
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,800
the European cyber security challenge

169
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,640
every year through cyber Olympics

170
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,829
individual CTF and hackathon

171
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:11,149
in serious role is choosing the Spanish

172
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:14,979
team that goes to the ECSC every year

173
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:20,329
and they're trained it in our facilities

174
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:21,829
this is two of our main tasks I'd like

175
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:23,569
to ask you something

176
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:25,399
so that you can explain this to young

177
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:28,040
people watching us that want to become

178
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,110
members of our team how can you remember

179
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,990
member of our team what do you do

180
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:39,529
interesting question the best way to

181
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:42,230
reach your goal is constant work for

182
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:45,370
example if you want to be good at CDF of

183
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:50,300
course you need to do that all the time

184
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:52,670
you need feedback there are platforms

185
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,800
such as city at time where there's a

186
00:09:52,670 --> 00:10:00,979
list of the competitions that take place

187
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,199
where you can register and perhaps you

188
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,050
need to play with the team but you can

189
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,899
go through challenges move forward and

190
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,000
if you don't solve a test which is no

191
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,690
more the first thing to get to know

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,190
something is not knowing that after

193
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,769
fighting with it you can look at the

194
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,110
solution and you understand the mo in

195
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:24,670
order to reach your goals and then you

196
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:29,000
just have to play to be constant and

197
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:31,120
come to cyber camp yes that's very

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,670
important

199
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,610
I've said that in Phoebus in charge of

200
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:38,680
training the Spanish team in that try

201
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,370
knowledge provided our facilities as a

202
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:46,839
technical part but also soft skills in

203
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:50,980
other words the skills that make you do

204
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:54,279
more efficient at your work business via

205
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:57,309
communication the ability to work as a

206
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:59,499
team managing stress conflicts how do

207
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:00,009
you see the training would provide an in

208
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:04,509
theory

209
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:09,089
ours was quite fun with with Miguel we

210
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:15,100
did things which were yeah his nothing a

211
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:20,319
bit crazy so to speak but some

212
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:22,629
activities were quite exotic but we had

213
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:23,949
loves we get to know each other one of

214
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:29,860
the best way to get to know each other

215
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:36,650
was being forced to do silly things

216
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:40,190
laugh at ourselves and of course

217
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:42,829
yeah working as a team and cohesion that

218
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:45,140
something pivotal because we choose a

219
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,540
group of people there are specialists in

220
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,310
specific categories each one is good at

221
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,880
something and we create a high

222
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:56,839
performance team and the cemetery of

223
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,060
capabilities creates a team that can

224
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,730
have a good performance and a

225
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,920
competition but you have to manage trust

226
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,560
because these years were two days 16

227
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,390
hours have been interrupted competition

228
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,790
and management stress is very important

229
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,750
I would like to add something it's very

230
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:17,750
tiring being under pressure you want to

231
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:20,090
get a good achieve a good result it's

232
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:24,170
complicated to handle all that so it's

233
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:28,460
important to have social skills because

234
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,140
as you say this is a team you need a

235
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,320
technical profile when you need to be

236
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,810
able to communicate because it's a team

237
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,760
you need self-criticism if you can't

238
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:42,530
solve something you need to say it you

239
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:45,439
cannot use a colleagues ideas that's it

240
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:49,760
I think well this are some pictures of

241
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,460
this year's training we train 15 people

242
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:57,230
from cyber comms competition in the end

243
00:12:52,460 --> 00:13:00,230
we had 10 members and five people for

244
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:03,740
reserve the first one was Jonathan who

245
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:07,970
came up second in city of competition

246
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:11,000
yesterday in cyber camp you already know

247
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,470
man Rockefeller would like you to get to

248
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,750
know the rest of the members of the team

249
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,360
you are not going to come up to stage

250
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,860
yet but we're going to watch a video of

251
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,860
this year's training

252
00:13:30,630 --> 00:14:53,050
[Music]

253
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,050
[Applause]

254
00:14:54,280 --> 00:15:03,930
[Music]

255
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:54,040
[Applause]

256
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:58,099
[Music]

257
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:01,189
when was this way LVL afirma so this is

258
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:04,040
the video of the training that we

259
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:11,959
receive that in civil and now let us go

260
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:15,110
into competition and then we will make a

261
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:19,819
technical demo of one of the challenges

262
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:22,009
that we did in London so those of you

263
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:24,259
who want to get closer to Europeans have

264
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:28,329
a security challenge it is started three

265
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,329
years ago as an initiative of venice'

266
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:38,420
with the origin track team and it is

267
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:40,970
kind of that the euro league of european

268
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,149
talents in this company did well the

269
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:49,160
design of CFT changes this year the

270
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:52,240
first possible attack on defense so the

271
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,189
parties here CTF with different

272
00:16:52,240 --> 00:17:00,799
categories forensic map analysis and

273
00:16:55,189 --> 00:17:03,679
also Santi ffs change every so often

274
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:05,990
manisa tries to give a different view a

275
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:09,349
different perspective every year so that

276
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:12,349
the competition continues to be healing

277
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:15,569
as well and actually the easier of the

278
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:18,980
other was

279
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:22,740
Ariella training where we could buy

280
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:24,659
shion-san is engaging comparation with

281
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,759
different countries at the end they

282
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:29,909
decided not to cover it will have worked

283
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:33,210
a lot on the aspects of negotiation well

284
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:38,850
we must say that we have kind of hurdle

285
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:42,029
with English English language okay so we

286
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:45,570
will improve our English hell though

287
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:50,309
this year we did a good job in when we

288
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:51,870
introduced ourselves and with now I'd

289
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,639
like to ask you what is the meaning of

290
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,549
this competition to you what do you mean

291
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:59,008
by the meaning so what does entail for

292
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:00,509
you taking participating there

293
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:03,059
representing Spain

294
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:06,029
how do you feel about it I'll give you

295
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:08,490
an example before participating for the

296
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:15,740
first time I didn't know anyone I didn't

297
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:18,750
know Borja nor Jose no one and I saw

298
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:22,409
articles in the news and saying that

299
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:27,179
Spanish team won the competition won the

300
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:28,200
challenge and to me I said well I want

301
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:31,110
to be there

302
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,740
that's my aspiration I would never be

303
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:37,350
one of them I would never win challenge

304
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,889
look one year later I was there in the

305
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:44,399
team and yes well you can see that he's

306
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:46,320
very humble actually he's very very good

307
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:48,750
he's the best

308
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,570
so participating in the European

309
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,100
challenge well this year we had the

310
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,590
participation of many countries the

311
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,629
level was very high so you don't feel

312
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:01,529
that you are participating in the

313
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:02,490
regional CTF it is a serious CTF is

314
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:04,320
higher level

315
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,539
yes actually I mentioned that some

316
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,490
colleagues in recent years the initial

317
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,158
purpose which was identifying and

318
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,500
promoting talent has kind of been lost

319
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,990
this is like being professionalized and

320
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,750
let us say you see some teens wearing

321
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,630
the icons and the

322
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:25,150
logos of companies and well because we

323
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:29,580
want to times we were kind of being I

324
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:32,500
don't known singles out so to speak and

325
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:35,949
these yeah well we had the participation

326
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,480
of 17 teams so 17 countries it is

327
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:40,600
expected Naseer to have the

328
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,760
participation of 20 countries so the

329
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,080
challenge is growing and growing the

330
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,580
first year there were only five

331
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,540
countries and what are the challenges

332
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:52,750
you are you face today so this year well

333
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,330
all the challenges as I said were

334
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,690
different multidisciplinary the

335
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,399
competition had a new party format

336
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:04,890
meaning that there were different

337
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,690
categories hacking web app hacking and

338
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:10,180
different challenges in each categories

339
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,580
and organized were classified by level

340
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:17,230
of difficulty the challenges were very

341
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:21,580
interesting and well this is a

342
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:26,830
photograph of our team there in London

343
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:29,139
and the facilities and now I'd like to

344
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:34,210
play video video for the first day of

345
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:38,070
the competition this is a setup that we

346
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,070
found in London

347
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:49,369

they in the competition understand

356
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:41,418
geography that was a competition site

357
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:43,429
very nice atmosphere second day was very

358
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:47,330
very good because we could see some very

359
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:50,570
many countries big teams we had a

360
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:53,408
cameraman with us we have me well our

361
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:59,779
assistants very many people involved

362
00:22:53,409 --> 00:23:00,889
right from the start to push the team to

363
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:03,259
get ahead of the others

364
00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:07,758
Anisa tries to innovate every year just

365
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:09,769
to add novelties to the competition and

366
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:13,279
this year they have been stand challenge

367
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:19,100
that was kind of like a step room

368
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:21,590
challenge with some horror to it so I

369
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,509
like you to tell us about a bit more

370
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,320
about that challenge but before that

371
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:26,320
I'll play video

when a contaminant consistent well tell

379
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:00,830
us a bit more about this challenge so

380
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:05,710
where do we fail

381
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,710
well that challenge was very interesting

382
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:16,520
it was not kind of usual it was escape

383
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:20,210
where we had to gain access fast trying

384
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:24,320
out a number of combinations to get the

385
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:30,260
pin number then we had to flag some

386
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:34,720
alarms and and well physically share any

387
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:37,670
annexes that says though that challenge

388
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,060
was held in the second day of the

389
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:44,030
competition of day one a diverse

390
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:47,990
competition we finished third we were

391
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:50,240
very close to finished first and we had

392
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,550
15,000 points but because of these

393
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,000
testings asserted to have gone wrong

394
00:25:52,550 --> 00:26:02,060
from the start what happened well I'm

395
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:05,480
one of the responsible for things going

396
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:09,260
wrong so well when we started the

397
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,120
challenge has - okay we went like we

398
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,310
rushed into it there were a number of

399
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,439
challenges that we had to go through

400
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,230
first of all a door that you had to open

401
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,840
through a pin code so the night before

402
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:26,060
we had given we will have been given a

403
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:27,860
cryptogram and then then we had to find

404
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,560
the script to open the door

405
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:34,040
we failed that we failed that test I

406
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:37,750
think that all the teams failed that

407
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:42,110
very first test the second test was

408
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:45,920
going into the the room and then there

409
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:48,800
there was an alarm yes actually we could

410
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,830
hear the alarm in the video and so there

411
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,440
was an alarm and all of us ignored it we

412
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:56,240
didn't pay attention to it in

413
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,230
my case I thought it was kind of like

414
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:04,879
they come down but no it was an actual

415
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:07,789
alarm and there was a code covering a

416
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:11,389
button that we had to press to keep

417
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:14,990
going and then well now wait for the

418
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:16,729
best part is coming so one of the part

419
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,700
was kind of a bomb that had to be

420
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:23,320
deactivated so the first thing that we

421
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:27,049
had to do is just to bridge some

422
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:31,730
circuits and publish our experts in

423
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:35,059
Harper he was bridging that and then one

424
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:37,789
of the bridges fell into the actual box

425
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:38,690
into the actual bomb and I mentioned to

426
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:42,529
you organizer

427
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:45,649
look we just lost days in the box can we

428
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:48,620
get another one he said no no well part

429
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:51,559
of the test challenge was for you to be

430
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:55,820
careful not to drop anything uh not to

431
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:57,710
lose any of the components and that was

432
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,200
another failure and the very last

433
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,250
failure which I'm fully responsible for

434
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,789
that I don't know where there are

435
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,080
players well the halves like sound gap

436
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:11,149
in them okay

437
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:15,500
everyone knew that but myself so we had

438
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:18,639
to careful wire simultaneously we

439
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:24,440
already yes ready three two one and then

440
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:27,049
when I did it I could see that one of

441
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,830
the tables have gone into that gap okay

442
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:34,309
I could see that I hadn't cut the food

443
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:37,009
wire and then I tried to cut it right at

444
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:42,200
the end and then they eat immediately

445
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:44,539
very low noise a cryptic noise like kind

446
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,639
of meaning that it has exploded and it

447
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:51,590
was probably said okay let us run away

448
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:53,959
okay he has not been defused okay and

449
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,000
that was a turning point because we went

450
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,340
into the room back into the room we were

451
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,710
disappointed the rest of the teams I

452
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,669
started to gain lots of points and we

453
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,640
got like kind of this car

454
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:08,910
and actually that was a key a key

455
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,550
challenge a key test and then well this

456
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,200
curve was very tight those 15,000

457
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,169
schools would have allowed us to have

458
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,100
finished fourth of fifth and then we

459
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:23,100
would analyze why we could not repeat in

460
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,780
our win this year and then as we said

461
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:30,540
before this competition has like part of

462
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:34,290
it is about introducing ourselves okay

463
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,180
if in the past we were penalized in that

464
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:38,040
test but this year we got tapas course

465
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,260
thanks to Manuel and his presentation

466
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,750
can you tell us more about it

467
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,550
well actually we knew that that test was

468
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,320
very important was very relevant in

469
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:49,110
terms of scoring and because we had

470
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,960
difficulties in provision we decided to

471
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:54,209
devote time Swedish to Train very much

472
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,020
so it's and then we did a very good job

473
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:00,420
I have a good command of English I'm

474
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:05,520
fluent in English and then that's why we

475
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:08,730
did a good job and now it's time to

476
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,290
answer the following questions since I

477
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,380
came back to London that was in October

478
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:16,649
I think I had to answer this question

479
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:19,860
like some hundred times it's not 150

480
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:22,710
times the question is about why Spanish

481
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,810
team has won the secretary challenge in

482
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,510
Malacca we have also won the previous

483
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:30,210
year we were about to have our third win

484
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:34,500
and as you can see this year in this

485
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:37,160
table so we finished 11th in 11 position

486
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:40,470
and they won we were very high up in the

487
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:43,110
score table but the very factors that

488
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,120
penalized us and second day one of the

489
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:48,870
junior guys one of the most talented

490
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,479
guys got sick had to go back to the

491
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:53,159
hotel so we played only with nine people

492
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,550
the first day we also had problems with

493
00:30:53,160 --> 00:31:02,770
connectivity to people couldn't work for

494
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:05,580
of hours or four good periods of time it

495
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:07,780
is true to say that the level of

496
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,850
participating countries is here was very

497
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,160
high higher than in previous year to

498
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:15,370
give you an example the Italian team had

499
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,370
six guys in them who had been in DEFCON

500
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:20,379
LasVegas professional players Polonia

501
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,169
had never been up in the ranking they

502
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,390
finished fools and then the trainer was

503
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:30,180
the captain of track dragon sector

504
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:34,210
Greece they were sponsored by heart box

505
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:40,210
some a number of regularities well they

506
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:43,540
kind of got some suspicious scoring and

507
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:48,040
actually the steering committee had very

508
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:50,050
hot debates and meetings and it was not

509
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,920
a read until the end when they disclosed

510
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:56,350
the final classification of final

511
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,410
results well I have analyzed this

512
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:01,510
several times before what about you how

513
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:03,670
do you feel but do you think what the

514
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:06,990
aspects that impacted as the most for

515
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:09,580
not to be higher up in the final results

516
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:11,950
well as we said before this competition

517
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,570
that's it for a couple of days well it

518
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,090
used to be 24 hours in the beginning

519
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:19,240
then it shifted increased from one day

520
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:21,220
to two days pressure was building up in

521
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,460
the secondaries we were very anxious we

522
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,980
were kind of worn out because virtually

523
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:30,400
speaking we were fast on day one and

524
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:33,610
then we had to keep that up and we just

525
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,920
couldn't do it as I say of drivel of

526
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:39,429
rivals okay the other teams were very

527
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:43,210
very high level and well that's that's

528
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:47,260
why when actually and they were kind of

529
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:49,930
going for us I didn't know since a

530
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:53,560
number one it is not that we felt

531
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:57,950
attacked but we received many claims or

532
00:32:53,560 --> 00:33:01,700
the managing and team received many

533
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:05,809
claims about us so there were Restless

534
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:07,269
to beat us so once Allah would you like

535
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:11,539
to add anything there

536
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:13,010
well I share what Noel said well we

537
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:15,200
finished the 11th because there were a

538
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:19,760
number of things that we didn't do right

539
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,260
oh well that we were not as encouraged

540
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,389
and the rest of the teams also did a

541
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,649
very good job well to be a bit

542
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:30,469
self-critical perhaps the team was not

543
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:32,330
did not flow as much as in previous

544
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,860
years perhaps we didn't have enough

545
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:40,939
training perhaps in previous years we

546
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:43,490
had more training so there was a bit of

547
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:46,880
lack of consistency between the senior

548
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:50,120
and junior team so at the end of the day

549
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,809
16 hours of competition one day - we

550
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,178
were all kind of bit crazy and as I said

551
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:59,149
before softer skills have very important

552
00:33:56,179 --> 00:34:00,980
to stress management teamwork becomes

553
00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:03,080
all the more important on the more

554
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,500
relevant and a crucial element for this

555
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,418
type of challenges and also the

556
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:12,530
finishing 11th it is not something with

557
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:15,949
that we should be not proud of

558
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:19,510
not at all it is not a defeat so for us

559
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:21,348
this season wind this is a triumph well

560
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:24,260
someone will go and say what you

561
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:26,030
finished 11 no no no those who said that

562
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,720
they have not been there they haven't

563
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,319
gone through it

564
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:34,089
higher higher level in all the teams is

565
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:34,089
here no one has been defeated

566
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:42,790
so this who actually fails are those who

567
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:45,168
stay at home who do not take part in the

568
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:48,199
challenges or in any qualification

569
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:51,168
grounds and here we have the winner of

570
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:52,790
individual CTF Cybercom so we have

571
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:56,388
another person who won the city of

572
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:59,480
DEFCON man who also go where CTF was won

573
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:01,569
last year so technically speaking our

574
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,390
team was very solvent robust and

575
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:09,020
competent is here ok we would like to

576
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:11,240
well to be clear and to share all that

577
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,610
with you so that you are whatever it is

578
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:18,200
Spain has always been a clear reference

579
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:20,210
inside an ascetic competition some money

580
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,609
this is a question for you we are also

581
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:27,230
reference outside the competition oh yes

582
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:29,450
we are we should not forget that this

583
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:33,260
competition rather than being an actual

584
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:35,839
competition and while beating our rebel

585
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,500
rivals it's about also about networking

586
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,610
making friends and we are very good

587
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,620
interacting with other teams we are

588
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,760
highly sociable we make good friends and

589
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,710
we really had a good time would you

590
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,510
please tell us more about the photograph

591
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:50,270
right in the middle but what you doing

592
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,680
there so we have friends with from

593
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:58,360
Switzerland and we'll were just dancing

594
00:35:51,680 --> 00:36:01,460
dancing together so we'll come through

595
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:04,450
well the experience that both captains

596
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:07,310
have had and now let us move on to the

597
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,000
technical side of the challenge Manuel

598
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:10,370
Gonzalo

599
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,450
will share with us some one of the

600
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:16,779
challenges that we had to solve ok all

601
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,779
yours

602
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:25,070
well the challenge was equal to it was

603
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:31,160
for exploding binaries in discussing

604
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:38,630
liners ok I'll go into technicalities

605
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:43,160
now it was an elf binary Linux 32-bit it

606
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:46,190
had a bit and ex asking the word first

607
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,920
act to be writable and it was linked

608
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,600
dynamically meaning that the system

609
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,690
libraries were not pre-loaded in the

610
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:57,770
actual binary but the libraries are set

611
00:36:53,690 --> 00:37:00,500
for in the OS so these facilities the

612
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:02,690
reversing of the binary that is to say

613
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,770
to see instruction by instruction but

614
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,660
the binary it does

615
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,340
that's quite facilitated quite a lot

616
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:12,290
another thing which is facilitated is

617
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:13,550
that the binary was not stripped that is

618
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,410
to say that the function and the names

619
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:19,069
of the variables were

620
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:22,368
visible perfectly legible so these

621
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:24,319
facilitates reverse engineering of the

622
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:29,900
binary for you to know what each faction

623
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:36,980
does bug of this binary is known as

624
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:39,890
format string but you can see that

625
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,990
better it was an S print F function

626
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:45,950
where the input of the user went right

627
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:49,399
away as became the second parameter of

628
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:53,839
the function which is the parameter that

629
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:59,470
defend the writing of the variable this

630
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:03,049
allows us to embed in the faction

631
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:07,669
modifiers that of our choice sovereign

632
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:11,089
since check TP allows us to access the

633
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:14,450
pointers in the stack that would be the

634
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:17,180
bug and now I'll change over to mono

635
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:20,569
who will tell us how to exploit that

636
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:24,129
vulnerability to execute remote code in

637
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:28,038
the server where the binary is written

638
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:31,720
as I said before the back was a

639
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:34,579
formatted string within the V print F

640
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:38,000
family which was the function that we

641
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:42,289
were given my mo to expect the bug was

642
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,619
to take advantage of two primitives so

643
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:48,859
we have a writing primitive and reading

644
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:53,480
primitive in the server production DSA

645
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:56,299
all our was not live was not enabled so

646
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,549
when there were Sun leaks okay we could

647
00:38:56,299 --> 00:39:00,288
exploit them for the rest of the

648
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:03,319
addresses and actually the exploit that

649
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:07,010
we developed will work even if the SI

650
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:11,119
and our would be enabled so therefore to

651
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:13,910
overcome the bypass ASL herb we used a

652
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,559
reading primitive we and then we

653
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:18,020
calculated the necessary these

654
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:21,829
placements to write the return address

655
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:24,288
of the handler which is a vulnerable

656
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:27,230
function and then we overwrite reading

657
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:29,119
we have a rosy descriptor of the socket

658
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,180
so therefore we had a loop

659
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,390
was really impassive data on an ongoing

660
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:37,098
basis the descriptor was overridden with

661
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:39,230
a different number a number that was not

662
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:41,960
open so we could break that and we could

663
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:51,109
end up in the return address and then we

664
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:54,740
also use J Lib libc Shakur so we entered

665
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:57,470
the clip BC address and then we took

666
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,808
advantage of any symbol that we found

667
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:02,240
and then with a writing primitive as I

668
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:04,789
said before we launched an attack of

669
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:10,308
written we wrote down the return address

670
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:11,900
in the stack of in the stack system to

671
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:13,970
overwrite that with the system address

672
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,670
and then we introduced the argument

673
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:18,529
which was in this case the reverse

674
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:21,859
function because we forget into the

675
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:23,990
return address we did return of the

676
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:25,578
socket so it was closed therefore the

677
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:29,779
address was no longer active we could

678
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:31,009
not remap the descriptors no nothing so

679
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:34,309
the only thing we could do there was

680
00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:36,170
inverse of reverse shell so as we saw

681
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:38,150
before because it was in the loop it was

682
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,329
reading it all the time on an ongoing

683
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:43,549
basis we just overeat we overwrite the

684
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:46,460
socket descriptor and now this is

685
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:49,819
exploit you can see we are automating

686
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:52,220
the exploiting system and well it has

687
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:55,249
been programming Python and you can see

688
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:59,209
here some witnesses of the format of

689
00:40:55,249 --> 00:41:00,259
direct access and we have the different

690
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:05,420
leaks from

691
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:08,499
I see and from stuck and then we move on

692
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:11,089
to above writing once we have the

693
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:13,609
addresses leaked then we calculated

694
00:41:11,089 --> 00:41:16,700
sockets and then we do two other

695
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:19,450
writings so we fast overwrite this stack

696
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:25,549
frame and then we adjusted this duck and

697
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:30,410
then we ask the command to be run and we

698
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:35,119
did also need casts to use the addresses

699
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:39,819
of address and then well now let us move

700
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,450
on to demo well hopefully it will fail

701
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:49,220
well now

702
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:52,450
just okay well we did not solve the

703
00:41:49,220 --> 00:42:07,750
challenge as a competition there was a

704
00:41:52,450 --> 00:42:07,750
technical problem this was a challenge

705
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:16,490
scoring nine thousand points we just did

706
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:19,180
not solve it because we had a valid flow

707
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:23,000
and actually we solved it when we were

708
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:25,040
coming back home on the plane so this is

709
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,880
exploit this is the address of the

710
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:32,589
machine to be attacked in the virtual

711
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,589
machine and you can see the address now

712
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:46,180
okay we will be sending in a net cut can

713
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:46,180
you see it

714
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,220
but

715
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:05,500
okay now we move on to exploit as an

716
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:12,250
argument we use the address that reduced

717
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:15,160
to listen to net cut okay we also

718
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:17,200
transfer the port where we started and

719
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:24,430
then we should be receiving the reverse

720
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:28,480
shell so we already have a fully

721
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:33,540
functional shell and this was the

722
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:36,880
exploit unless we got a random code

723
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:39,520
execution then we had to read the black

724
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,670
file and we were given this virtual

725
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:45,610
machine for us to make testings to do

726
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:47,020
our testings so when you're making an

727
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:49,690
exploit the first thing that you do is

728
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,759
you test it locally when it works

729
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:54,310
locally you just launch it against the

730
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,530
server under production you are not

731
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,480
going to launch exploits if they are not

732
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:00,790
fully functional because if you do that

733
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,220
you may be living logs behind you that

734
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:05,950
may be later analyzed first you see

735
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:10,680
develop the exploit locally and then you

736
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:10,680
launch it to the server in production

737
00:44:15,809 --> 00:44:28,589
we went to debug mode we see how the

738
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:33,689
elec was loaded we just didn't want the

739
00:44:28,589 --> 00:44:37,808
address to be leaked to find the offset

740
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:40,538
so we found the formats logs we

741
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:43,209
calculated the address the displacements

742
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:46,029
and then we came up we came up to with

743
00:44:43,209 --> 00:44:50,948
the MAC address then we did some

744
00:44:46,029 --> 00:44:58,569
debugging so these are the 21 bytes

745
00:44:50,949 --> 00:45:00,999
we sent in the payload and this is what

746
00:44:58,569 --> 00:45:02,649
what we did to solve the challenge oh

747
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:05,999
this is the way you solve the challenge

748
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:05,999
and that's awesome

749
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,959
[Applause]

750
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,630
well actually we thought we'll be here

751
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:22,650
for half an hour we've been for almost

752
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,929
an hour

753
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,819
unfortunately we just don't have any

754
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:30,329
more time let us finish with the

755
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:33,509
official video maybe they're sharing the

756
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:35,699
experience of Spanish team in London so

757
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:37,469
probably some of you haven't finished

758
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:40,199
have you watched the video no many I

759
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:46,579
have not watched the video okay we play

760
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:46,579
the video to finish off with our session

761
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,050
[Music]

762
00:46:05,050 --> 00:47:17,699

[Music]

765
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:44,489
why No yeah what I mean I'm sorry okay

766
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:47,619
so we're saying it now we'd like to have

767
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:51,239
the other members of our team up here to

768
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:54,160
take a family picture I would like to

769
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:56,170
request the presence if a person who's

770
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:01,058
very important who's in charge of all

771
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:04,390
this event that the Deana she had made

772
00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:07,590
this event reality

773
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,589
[Applause]

774
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:43,670
bueno M carry on justo cuarenta segundos

775
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:47,180
my America we just have 46 seconds left

776
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:49,220
I would have liked to interview and of

777
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,750
the guys but it wouldn't have enough

778
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,750
time perhaps a question from our

779
00:49:50,750 --> 00:50:04,010
audience does anyone want to ask a

780
00:49:53,750 --> 00:50:06,350
question yes I would like to know about

781
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:08,570
the renovation how many people knock on

782
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:11,810
your door how many people get in every

783
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:15,080
year well we were you serious about that

784
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:19,549
the competition has roads ten people per

785
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:23,330
team five have to be juniors between 16

786
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:28,330
and 21 years old and the others from 21

787
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:31,069
to 25 but in theory position rate is 40%

788
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:33,799
four people have to be new every day

789
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:36,250
five juniors and five seniors that has

790
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,250
to be kept

791
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,599
[Music]

792
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:46,979
you're competing these days in cyber

793
00:50:44,129 --> 00:50:57,449
camp but do have the numbers 150 about

794
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:58,489
150 people must play wonders no more

795
00:50:57,449 --> 00:51:02,459
questions

796
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:07,529
does anyone want to say something

797
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:08,868
they're very shy the captains do the

798
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:10,630
talking

799
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:14,340
thank you very much

800
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:14,340
