2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,739
my non-primitive are available

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,420
first of all hazard lights whoo thank

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,360
everyone who's in here with people who

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,670
are following us on the streaming and so

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,000
I'd like to thank the organizers in

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:31,230
thievery for inviting me to be here to

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,110
me it is an honor and a pleasure and

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,720
also create responsibilities because of

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,370
the outstanding speakers that have

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:47,250
spoken before me and when let us move on

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:53,099
to the my lecture right away so the

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:57,240
title may sound a bit Africans i but the

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:03,810
title given to it is service security is

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:10,159
for me so I also would like you to take

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:13,549
us a home message that cybersecurity is

17
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,549
also for you

18
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:30,380
so I was introduced by cher I said

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:37,288
before I have degree in journalism

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:40,610
I've studied humanities and art so it is

21
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:44,689
but perhaps you will be a stranger

22
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:44,689
finding a journalist

23
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:52,060
having a career in cyber security as a

24
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:55,119
generalist I realized about the

25
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,049
relevance and importance of this topic

26
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:03,700
and as well as other technical matters

27
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:10,090
so I decided to go being beyond an

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:12,850
amateur and also I started to practice

29
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,730
it myself and I also decided to put at

30
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,609
the disposal of the cybersecurity

31
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:23,370
community and number of elements I

32
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:28,900
organized some activities and I also

33
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:31,300
managed a blog amongst others so my

34
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:36,100
presentation will be divided in three

35
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:39,760
sections so this is personal so please

36
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:47,560
I'm telling you what the steps that I've

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:49,120
taken how I got where I am now also to

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,420
tell you I would like to tell you about

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,600
the need for cyber security to be a

40
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:58,328
multidisciplinary discipline and last I

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,940
would also refer to professional skills

42
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:03,480
that are demanded in the worlds of cyber

43
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,480
security

44
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,090
[Music]

45
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:19,079
solve the reason there is a reason why

46
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:22,530
for me to use this character well some

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,920
of you may not know him he is because

48
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:30,390
you are young and he's Paco Martinez

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:34,170
Sadia and well-known actor in Spain and

50
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:39,660
then one of his movies was this one on

51
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:42,390
the stream said city is not for me so I

52
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,850
wanted to play around with the title of

53
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,019
that movie and the title of my

54
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,810
presentation

55
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,820
so therefore finding a link between Paco

56
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,040
Martinez aureus and myself could be a

57
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:58,910
bit difficult but could be the link

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:03,570
between his movie and well myself a 21st

59
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:05,370
century journalist working in the field

60
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,190
of cybersecurity

61
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:13,110
well in the movie

62
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:16,440
Paco Martinez Soria is a man who lives

63
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:20,220
in a village he lost his wife and he

64
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:24,169
decided to go to the big city and then

65
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:28,539
he what to experience

66
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:28,539
different life and to go through

67
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:35,989
different walk of life so in the end of

68
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,479
the movie he comes back to his village

69
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:44,210
but as he spends time in the city but

70
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,729
because he's not used to big cities many

71
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:50,299
big things happened to him and now

72
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:52,909
trying to find her parallel he we could

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,759
I could draw a parallel between him and

74
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:58,699
myself when I entered the world of cyber

75
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,599
security I was kind of like him I caught

76
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:04,909
my mobile phone my tripod and I went

77
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:06,650
from one place to another and at the end

78
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:09,438
of the day that's what we have we have

79
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,469
me a journalist in the world of

80
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:14,840
cybersecurity and as I say I was not

81
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:17,509
very much aware I didn't have expertise

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,049
on that much knowledge about service

83
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:20,930
security

84
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:23,419
still I decided to go into that unknown

85
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:28,849
world in the beginning was kind of a bit

86
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:32,628
lost because that was highly technical

87
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:38,569
environment but little by little I

88
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:41,089
started to be less and less afraid of it

89
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:43,969
and I decided to find out what that

90
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:45,480
world could offer to me because we

91
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:49,760
should not forget

92
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:54,210
journalists are driven by my curiosity I

93
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,030
attended conferences and congresses over

94
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,840
time I also ended up organizing other

95
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:03,450
events and here is photograph showing

96
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:09,960
some of the events and activities that I

97
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:13,770
took part and as I say well in the

98
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:17,070
beginning I organized conferences and I

99
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,440
was also following doing videos in

100
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:23,640
YouTube and then there came a time that

101
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:28,650
I started to go to places meeting people

102
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:31,050
face to face continue carrying my mobile

103
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:34,229
phone my camera my tripod with me and

104
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,840
continue doing my filming my recordings

105
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,320
so this transition in this world which

106
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,570
was very unknown to me in the beginning

107
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:47,370
now it is an extremely happy with it

108
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:49,440
I will not go back around not I wouldn't

109
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,650
do anything else as I say in the

110
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,380
beginning I went through a phase of

111
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:58,560
observation and adapting I was kind of

112
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,480
out of place I got used to it little by

113
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,370
little then I went through a learning

114
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,890
phase and then I went through an

115
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,670
emotional face I will tell you more

116
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:11,190
about each of these stages

117
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:13,530
you may feel related to some of the

118
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,780
things that happened to me perhaps you

119
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,030
and it's the first time that you are

120
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,979
attending Cybercom perhaps you have the

121
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,400
same feeling that I had in the beginning

122
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:26,690
that is to say entering

123
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,650
unknown scenario and a known landscape I

124
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:35,840
kind of jumped into that world and there

125
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:38,750
was no security net there waiting for me

126
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,109
and as I say only had basic knowledge of

127
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:46,940
IT and then I was kind of feeling that I

128
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:49,400
was entering into a vacuum as I said

129
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,190
I've always been had a curious person I

130
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:57,049
very much always liked technology but it

131
00:07:52,190 --> 00:08:00,080
was a medium level user and then well

132
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:04,280
everyone I was going I wanted to explore

133
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,669
about hacking hackers and I also wanted

134
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:10,729
to find out whether the that world that

135
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,330
word was being participated by women as

136
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,630
well

137
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,800
and how did I approach that well I

138
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:23,860
started to bring down myths but the

139
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,860
first one was the IT

140
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:34,630
so I was just user I've never gone to

141
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:39,789
any technical school therefore I don't

142
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:44,770
have enough expertise to have a

143
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:47,980
technical career I didn't know any

144
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:50,199
programming languages but when it comes

145
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,150
to communicating with people working in

146
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,460
the field of cybersecurity I had no

147
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,920
problem whatsoever in communicating with

148
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,350
them in understanding and following that

149
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,079
language and also to relate on to others

150
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,590
so I didn't have the crucial need or the

151
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,070
actual need to know about any

152
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:12,610
programming language to communicate with

153
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:18,180
cybersecurity experts as I said I didn't

154
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:22,860
need any technical degree or knowing any

155
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:26,680
programming languages I have not ever

156
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,480
disassembled a computer either so with

157
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,010
this I mean that I just didn't need to

158
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,500
have any IT engineering degree to talk

159
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,870
to people in this world at that time I

160
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:40,050
had to discover and find out what was

161
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:43,780
happening with hackers

162
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:47,229
some other time it was often said the

163
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:50,860
hackers were very dark figure something

164
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,820
hidden they were the evil guys what we

165
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,940
should

166
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:58,600
out we had to break down the myth about

167
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:01,270
hackers the more hawkers I met in my

168
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,000
life the more I brought down this myth

169
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:07,329
hackers are just experts who are trying

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,840
to better themselves all the time that

171
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,930
will go beyond the ideal world we often

172
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:17,800
associate chakras with technology but

173
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:20,410
anyone in the career in the job desu

174
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,250
could consider themselves to be jaquez

175
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:27,189
some mechanics and actual hackers when

176
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:31,210
they find you close and make them go

177
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:34,630
faster that they are designed for

178
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:37,960
so therefore hackers should be seen and

179
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:40,300
considered as by what they are the

180
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:45,150
actual expert and here perhaps I'm

181
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:51,209
throwing stones at my guild the guild of

182
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:54,490
communicators of me we communicators

183
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:57,520
continue to classify hackers and to talk

184
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:02,560
about hackers and evils and the bad guys

185
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:05,140
and then we should not go against

186
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,329
hackers they are not cyber criminals

187
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:11,260
contrary to what is often said they are

188
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:14,470
not bad guys just the opposite nowadays

189
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,610
will have part of the security that we

190
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:20,610
have in place has been contributed by

191
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,610
hackers

192
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:32,830
and actually the Spanish dictionary of

193
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:39,910
Spanish up until a year ago only had one

194
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:39,910
but refer to hackers as IT pirates

195
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,850
some definitions going to the dictionary

196
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,380
depending on how much they are induced

197
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,110
by society

198
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,870
so therefore nazia haka was also defined

199
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:03,470
as an expert person in charge of hundred

200
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:08,030
computers which are in charge of dealing

201
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:11,420
with system security and also in charge

202
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:13,520
of developing improvement techniques but

203
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,780
this is not the solution to everything

204
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,760
so the first definition of hackers

205
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:24,490
should be eliminating from the

206
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:28,370
dictionary because when someone checks

207
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:31,990
Hakka term in the dictionary if but to

208
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,850
read the first definition will be misled

209
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:38,780
the half the second definition should be

210
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:41,270
indulged but which first definition

211
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:46,670
should be taken out from the dictionary

212
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:53,960
so that hackers are considered as as the

213
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:56,900
experts they are all the people that are

214
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,760
met in my life were catalogue of

215
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,379
classified as hackers and there are no

216
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,989
hackers at all

217
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:08,369
they play different roles in different

218
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:10,649
areas in different places huggers are

219
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:12,869
the present and the future of the

220
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:16,630
service security of our country they

221
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:19,730
gather significant talent

222
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,730
[Music]

223
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:30,940
therefore definition of hackers our

224
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:35,199
understanding of them should change

225
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:39,439
hackers are not bad guys

226
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:41,990
extremely important people and the third

227
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:44,660
myth that I wanted to break down was

228
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,959
whether the women participating in the

229
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:51,920
world of cybersecurity

230
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:54,319
when we go to cybersecurity event which

231
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:59,449
will have 50% women and men both as

232
00:13:54,319 --> 00:14:02,209
speakers and as attendees but in the

233
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:04,219
world of cybersecurity there are women

234
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,349
they could be more women but what can we

235
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,660
do to have more women participating in

236
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:11,439
the world of cybersecurity which I think

237
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:16,819
that technology is not a gender issue

238
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:20,050
women or men are not move skilled to

239
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:22,089
work in the field of cybersecurity

240
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:26,050
[Applause]

241
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:28,870
which should read of that idea and in

242
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:31,839
order to attract more women into the

243
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:36,850
world of cybersecurity we should

244
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:41,260
normalize the job market of

245
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:44,230
cybersecurity and we should give more

246
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:48,660
visibility to women who are already

247
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,660
working in the field of cybersecurity

248
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,430
highly-skilled women working in the

249
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,430
field of cybersecurity I didn't find

250
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:04,969
that it meets many women in the

251
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,250
cybersecurity events went to than very

252
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,840
many of them but there are some of them

253
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,780
and every significant family

254
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,690
intelligence cybersecurity providing

255
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:18,470
significant value and we have to foster

256
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:20,450
that we have to make sure that those

257
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,900
women who have a vocation in

258
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:26,810
cybersecurity go ahead with this they

259
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:29,060
these women should not feel that this is

260
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,280
a masculine world and there is no place

261
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,380
for them we should support them we

262
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,500
should offer them equal opportunities

263
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,820
and we should give visibility to women

264
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,520
in cybersecurity

265
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,850
that was my observation stage this is

266
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:47,329
the way I approach cybersecurity the

267
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:51,200
learning stage starts but never ends

268
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:56,930
well adapting phase is over now

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:16:00,890
whereas learning stage as that started

270
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:06,760
the day I was born and it will accompany

271
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:06,760
me all my life until the day I die

272
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:25,849
I defined myself as life Nana and I am

273
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:29,329
driven by my curiosity therefore how did

274
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:31,370
I approach my learning stage was a

275
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,780
generalist going into the world of

276
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,760
cybersecurity I knew that I had to have

277
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:41,689
to gain an understanding leader by later

278
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:47,290
to find my place in it I walked you

279
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:50,450
through that learning stage through

280
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:53,360
contributing value value trace there is

281
00:16:50,450 --> 00:17:01,640
not limit in terms of learning how did I

282
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:05,780
get into this world how I went about as

283
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:08,690
I was getting more and more into

284
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,990
cybersecurity well first of all by

285
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:14,540
taking in technical terms in the

286
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,740
beginning when I talked to technical

287
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:22,339
people I could not understand half of

288
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,319
what they were saying I continued not to

289
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:31,040
understand hundred percent of what they

290
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:34,010
tell me but I keep learning I do need to

291
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,409
understand the technique holidays

292
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:41,930
because I am the conveyor belt that

293
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:45,200
relays information out to the general

294
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:49,040
public so therefore I have to learn more

295
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:54,680
and more I have to take in the

296
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,680
technical language little by little I

297
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,580
also learned from experts from different

298
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,480
fields

299
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:06,090
I love being surrounded by experts and

300
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,080
the cybersecurity world is really really

301
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:13,020
broad there is lots to learn from very

302
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:17,220
many different experts I love learning

303
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:21,150
from them and learning with them try to

304
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:24,030
surround yourselves by experts even if

305
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:29,400
they are far away from what did you do

306
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:33,120
with always learn from them so that has

307
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,780
been of great value to me listening a

308
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,870
lot attending conferences following

309
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:43,050
videos following online training courses

310
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:45,360
reading in-laws watching many videos

311
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,879
that's the way you learn you learn from

312
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,639
very many different sources from many

313
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,640
experts and also I attending cyber

314
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,460
security events so in the beginning I

315
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,580
showed you photographs with many of the

316
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,190
events that I went to to have to go to

317
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,899
those cybersecurity events and make the

318
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:10,280
most of them not only by listening to

319
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:13,380
speakers but by taking advantage of any

320
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:16,680
opportunities you may have to talk to

321
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:20,010
speakers and not only two speakers but

322
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,520
also to our attendees people who are

323
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,890
sitting next to you surely those people

324
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,299
next to you

325
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:31,710
very many things to contribute so

326
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,920
therefore when you go to service

327
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:39,840
security events network network with

328
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:42,809
people with everyone there and as I say

329
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,340
make the most of that and if you kind of

330
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:55,260
really go physically to those events

331
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:58,799
follow them on streaming and now in this

332
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:01,140
learning stage everything that I've

333
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,090
learned that I'm learning from this

334
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:08,150
cyber security world what is the

335
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:12,020
contribution that I make how do I add

336
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:15,480
value as a journalist as a

337
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,660
disseminator of a communicator of cyber

338
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,570
security but contribution can nightmares

339
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,970
but I can make my contribution through

340
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:28,139
giving a voice to service security

341
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:32,580
experts that I invite through my channel

342
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:35,130
palabra de haka and as I say when I go

343
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,560
to events I go I take my mobile phone

344
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,860
with me I record

345
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,428
[Music]

346
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:48,040
that reversible event a part of the

347
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:51,020
event and then i broadcast it and i

348
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,620
disseminated through a video so

349
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:57,620
therefore I give voice to cybersecurity

350
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:59,689
experts so that we communicate we talk

351
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:03,739
about cybersecurity in the plane and

352
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:08,750
simple to follow in language but other

353
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:12,559
things do I contribute I go beyond being

354
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:16,610
an event assistant because I don't have

355
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:21,129
any technical expertise or education at

356
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:27,049
the end of the day I decided to organize

357
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:32,120
some security events we have organized

358
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:35,570
two editions so far and these events are

359
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:40,280
free of charge we organize technical

360
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:45,850
workshops technical presentations and

361
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:48,889
lectures I also organize hug convinced

362
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:51,610
and these are free talks that are giving

363
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:54,559
across Spain in an informal environment

364
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,590
and whereas people network with each

365
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:01,820
other share experiences and share

366
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:05,209
knowledge and ideas so then as I say I

367
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,309
went beyond being an assistant and I

368
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:10,010
decided to contribute value to the

369
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:13,010
community through organization of events

370
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:16,040
so that people like yourselves have the

371
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:19,879
opportunity to go there as attendees all

372
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:24,610
other speakers and the third area where

373
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,610
a contribute value is the following

374
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:34,030
train inside I am a freelance trainer

375
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:37,540
I've also participated as a trainer in

376
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:42,790
the school meetings and training

377
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:46,260
sessions organized by M fever I tried to

378
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:49,139
raise awareness and seminaries to

379
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:52,480
highest number of people possible

380
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,650
cybersecurity is a question is a theme

381
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,650
that affects us all

382
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:03,440
and that's why we all should be aware of

383
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:09,260
cybersecurity and all together should

384
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:12,380
disseminate dissemination so that all

385
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:21,879
together we can contribute to more

386
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:25,520
secure and safer internet and now the

387
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:28,400
emotional stage so this is very much

388
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:32,480
present in my life that would never be

389
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,510
lost in me I get fully involved in

390
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,540
everything that I do this journey that I

391
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:42,290
have travelled helped me develop myself

392
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:45,050
personally and all the knowledge and

393
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:48,530
expertise that I got from very many of

394
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:51,470
the experts that I met first of all I

395
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:56,120
was very thankful to them for that and I

396
00:23:51,470 --> 00:24:00,020
also was humble enough to come close to

397
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,879
them and to the world so sometimes when

398
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:07,960
you go into a field which is fully

399
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,960
unknown to you it's not always easy

400
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:18,909
so you need to find the balance across

401
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:22,330
that Danny well I do enjoy the journey

402
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:26,230
my purpose is not reaching a destination

403
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:28,090
I enjoy my ongoing learning my

404
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,700
day-to-day learning my day-to-day

405
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,220
journey when it comes to emotion you

406
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,410
really need to cope with be good and

407
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,980
with the bad when you go into a

408
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:41,590
completely new sector and you start to

409
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,650
carry out activities there for instance

410
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,389
my youtube channel palavra dehaka

411
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,910
when you start to disseminate knowledge

412
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:52,510
which is the main purpose that made me

413
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:55,420
to open that channel as I said when you

414
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,850
start to do new things in a sector which

415
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,570
is not done to you things are not always

416
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:01,480
easy

417
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,939
I had to face situations that were not

418
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,940
comfortable to me but I knew I had to

419
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:10,360
cope with them and as I said the price I

420
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:12,310
had to pay a price sometimes to

421
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:17,560
disseminate information about cyber

422
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:21,220
security and well if you in this field

423
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:24,370
or in this stage of learning I had to

424
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:28,930
face situations not very comfortable for

425
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:33,969
instance after no life field

426
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:37,390
I got like fake followers and blocking

427
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:40,360
my account therefore had to cope with

428
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:44,710
all those fake followers that were there

429
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:48,850
trying to block my account offices I had

430
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:52,000
to hack they a live feed talk about deal

431
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:54,370
as attacks and explain that they were a

432
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,420
way of threatening people and during

433
00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:03,120
that life feed well because the debate

434
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:06,340
was a YouTube they do to attack who was

435
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:10,179
launched against the server were my web

436
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:12,949
and others were hosted a deal as attack

437
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,590
was launched and then the

438
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,980
because it was life going through

439
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,230
YouTube it was not interrupted these are

440
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,170
some of the situations the bad situation

441
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:27,720
that I had to face so no one has said

442
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:31,950
that this was an easy thing to do or

443
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:35,220
sometimes do receive negative feedback

444
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:38,490
and criticism but what actually trust me

445
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,340
for in the day-to-day basis are the very

446
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:44,810
many comments and feedback that I get

447
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,810
publicly and in private

448
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:55,330
it is and this is what I take this to me

449
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,719
for words and these are testimonials

450
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:02,740
comments that have been posted publicly

451
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:05,700
my channel you which really showed that

452
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:08,470
the effort that I'm making is worthwhile

453
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,670
people who are seeing the value they are

454
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:15,310
having what I'm disseminating and

455
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:18,820
communicating about cybersecurity these

456
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,530
comments this feedback is what motivates

457
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,960
me

458
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:28,990
give me the daily feel that I need to

459
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:32,290
continue contributing this value until

460
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:37,210
five manage to do all that and to

461
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:39,550
succeed in garland tribute that I'm sure

462
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,910
to because we are here you have

463
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:47,500
motivation pushing you forward I'm sure

464
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:50,470
that if I could do it you will do it as

465
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,510
well surely you will find your place you

466
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,030
will find it you'd like to do in

467
00:27:52,510 --> 00:28:00,250
cybersecurity no matter your background

468
00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:02,160
or where you come from and this is very

469
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,990
very important because I feel that

470
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,270
security is a matter that concerns us

471
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:10,570
all cyber security should be

472
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:12,490
multidisciplinary topic this is not

473
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:15,060
something which is only the

474
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:19,480
responsibility or that affects only

475
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:22,810
technical people these are the bases and

476
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:26,690
these good certain voices to implement

477
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:30,800
very many projects and here

478
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:33,900
here we have a section which is others

479
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,889
others including very many other

480
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,150
professional experts so service security

481
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:43,160
is something that affects in law

482
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:47,130
enforcement agencies educator analysts

483
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:50,370
forensic analysts public prosecutors

484
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,670
judges etc etc

485
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,669
[Music]

486
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:01,010
in the workshop delivered by manner it

487
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:06,110
was said that all the evidence that it

488
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:08,030
is gather in IOT devices had to be

489
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,590
communicated had to be reported to

490
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:12,950
judges in the manner that they could

491
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:15,679
understand it and perhaps the idea is

492
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:20,450
that all these public prosecutors and

493
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:22,880
lawyers and other should be trained or

494
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:25,130
receive enough information so that you

495
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,300
understand that language to understand

496
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:33,350
what happens in the worlds of

497
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:35,899
cybersecurity when this you know my loss

498
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:38,600
totalmente canto de la prophet all the

499
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:42,440
professionals are the ones that have to

500
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:46,129
work in the different areas growing in

501
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:50,570
the same direction said that this has a

502
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:52,700
good result we have to do our bit it's

503
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,820
not enough just by having the technical

504
00:29:52,700 --> 00:30:00,250
part we need regulations and lawyers and

505
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:04,790
prosecutors need to know about it and

506
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:06,950
journalists lawyers need to know what's

507
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:10,700
all this about not just when one or I

508
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:13,670
happens we need to know about

509
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,780
cybersecurity end-users need to wake up

510
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:21,740
and be familiar with this type of things

511
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:25,250
today I miss a national wine nationwide

512
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:28,370
campaign to launch messages related to

513
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,560
cybersecurity same win a few years ago

514
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:34,189
trophy campaigns were launched say

515
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:38,770
telling people to fasten their seat belt

516
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:41,320
now but they're still campaign

517
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,600
if you don't fasten your seatbelt you

518
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:48,010
can still do it but you have the

519
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:53,610
information today I think there should

520
00:30:48,010 --> 00:31:01,420
be a nation one can pain that reminds

521
00:30:53,610 --> 00:31:04,120
people how important is to have security

522
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:10,480
measures in place which is changing

523
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:14,320
password covering the webcam the basic

524
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,120
part of this is failing there will

525
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,280
always be people that even when they're

526
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,689
aware of things they don't do them but

527
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:24,820
we need to realize the cybersecurity is

528
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:28,780
cross-cutting we have will have to do

529
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:34,810
our beat we'll need to acquire knowledge

530
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:39,129
in technical security we may be

531
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:42,610
technical people or not as it's my case

532
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:45,550
this is my case but we'll need to have

533
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:49,659
this information this is part of our

534
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:55,780
daily life today professionals from

535
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:59,590
different areas that have shown interest

536
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:02,649
on cybersecurity those professionals

537
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:07,860
from other areas who have an interest

538
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:11,290
and capabilities in and skills in

539
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,120
cybersecurity what they have something

540
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:16,420
else a lawyer that knows about these

541
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:22,419
things have a competitive advantage

542
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:25,020
compared to someone who wants to keep on

543
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:29,980
doing the same thing we need different

544
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:32,879
professionals from different areas that

545
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,880
learn about this

546
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:42,370
having said that cybersecurity is not

547
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:44,350
something fashionable apparently it

548
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:49,949
seems that everybody speaking about

549
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:54,490
cybersecurity now but it's not

550
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:57,580
fashionable it has come here to stay

551
00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:02,100
it's always going to be present and it's

552
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:07,570
obvious it's evident that we need

553
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:11,408
prepared people with passion with talent

554
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:15,039
but they already exist there are people

555
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:19,629
like this this professional was exists

556
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:23,710
and sometimes when people speak about

557
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:28,629
cybersecurity when they say that it's

558
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:33,789
something fashionable there are many

559
00:33:28,629 --> 00:33:36,939
things which are not real and young

560
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:40,389
people feel curious and want to know

561
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:43,269
more about this they hear things such as

562
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:48,779
we need many more experts people need to

563
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:48,779
be motivated yes that it's true

564
00:33:52,310 --> 00:34:04,810
among all the news in the press these

565
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:07,880
type of headlines which are of concern

566
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:09,830
but depend this depends on the newspaper

567
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,300
you open every day depending on that

568
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:16,659
newspaper you mean what may have one

569
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:20,600
information are the opposite information

570
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:24,140
such as we need 1 million professional

571
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:27,529
mall 1.5 million 2 million or next year

572
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:28,429
in 2009 the world will require between 5

573
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:32,510
and 6 million

574
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:34,550
experts from 1 to 6 million well it

575
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:37,400
depends on the newspaper you opened that

576
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:39,590
morning you have many opportunities I

577
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,429
have every opportunity in the world this

578
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:46,730
is me if you follow this headlines what

579
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:52,090
that will be a mistake if you follow

580
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:54,550
this headlines you would think that

581
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:59,620
cyber security is something fashionable

582
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,620
well it's not it has I'm here to stay

583
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:09,030
when I was studying they told me that

584
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:11,420
what headlines were very big it meant it

585
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,420
was a catastrophe

586
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:23,020
when I studied the newspapers were on

587
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:26,740
paper when he had the headline or the

588
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,990
middle pages it was your your headline

589
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:35,890
was huge that meant it was a catastrophe

590
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:38,830
something huge and today the written

591
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:43,420
press and online press we have big

592
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:48,850
headlines to highlight any type of news

593
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:53,580
and we need some balance here and then

594
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:58,480
we find things such as this one 82% of

595
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:07,740
companies says that the hacked deed to a

596
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:07,740
lack of talent well this was my reaction

597
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,339
I was saying about the thing about

598
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:17,049
journalists but when it comes to

599
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:20,769
cybersecurity because journalists inform

600
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:24,038
about what people say and in below that

601
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:26,439
you see before a lack of talent prepared

602
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:29,019
take about cyberattacks 9 out of 10

603
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,420
companies think of the machines will be

604
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:33,689
able to carry out the tasks better than

605
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:36,769
human

606
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,769
[Music]

607
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,450
we've seen the previous headlines and

608
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,420
this is the headlines nine of the ten

609
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:50,558
companies think that machines will be do

610
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,789
this better than humans well neither of

611
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:54,400
the two things are true

612
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:56,769
these companies are hiked it's not due

613
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,609
to a lack of talents it's due to a lack

614
00:36:56,769 --> 00:37:02,709
of resources lack of investments in

615
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:05,739
order to have a professional to be

616
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:08,379
secure perhaps companies are not doing

617
00:37:05,739 --> 00:37:10,269
the homework but 82% of the companies

618
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,019
are not hacked get you a lack of talent

619
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:19,258
but a lack of budget so you have to bear

620
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:24,930
many things in mind it doesn't matter

621
00:37:19,259 --> 00:37:24,930
what number we find in those headlines

622
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:35,368
this is evidence today it acknowledges

623
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,368
growing so fast

624
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:43,690
so it's growing so quickly that there

625
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:47,350
are new jobs and we need to cover new

626
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:50,830
jobs but it's impossible to estimate the

627
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:54,339
number it's impossible to know how many

628
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:57,340
people you're going to need because

629
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:59,860
otherwise right now an employment in our

630
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:03,010
industry would be 0% which is not the

631
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:05,740
case people who are good who are

632
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:08,020
talented have a lot of opportunities and

633
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:11,319
now it's a good time if you truly love

634
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:13,900
this if this is what you want to do in

635
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:17,170
life whether your boys or a girl this is

636
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,820
a good moment Iranian cyber security but

637
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:21,670
the demands of professions will not

638
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:24,370
exist forever right now the headlines

639
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,800
are telling us a huge demand well with

640
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:30,460
time it will be more balanced and at

641
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:34,630
some point supply and offer will be

642
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:39,010
balanced so it's a good time to study if

643
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:41,020
you truly love this sector but not only

644
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:44,040
from a technical point of view we've

645
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,040
said it's cross-cutting

646
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:55,050
and being well positioned well we need

647
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:57,240
to to outperform all the people as

648
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:59,940
professionals to be ready to cover this

649
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,879
positions and I hope their governments

650
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,040
and companies willing to cover those

651
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,200
positions with talent that already

652
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,620
exists because we've seen done in Spain

653
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,899
there is talent another to cover this

654
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:16,140
positions you need to make a difference

655
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:20,070
those of you who are studying or you're

656
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:22,109
going to access your first job or

657
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:27,150
perhaps not the first job but the first

658
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:31,970
job in cybersecurity today you need to

659
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,970
be different from others

660
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:39,390
you need to make sure that you are the

661
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,550
chosen one what are the basic

662
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,299
professional skills they need to be

663
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:48,560
added to the knowledge you already have

664
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:51,930
what we are assuming and your knowledge

665
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,259
whether it's following regulated

666
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:58,350
education programs or yourself or your

667
00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:01,800
service person regardless of the

668
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:06,029
knowledge you have you need to

669
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:11,250
differentiate from others in any area by

670
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:15,360
offering some things when I demand it

671
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:19,260
today due to how jobs work today we need

672
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,840
to be able to work as a team in Cybercom

673
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:26,490
we've seen that people work as a team

674
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:30,480
the hackathon people were participating

675
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:33,509
for a few hours trying to develop things

676
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,460
and they were working as a team

677
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:39,300
yesterday youngest ones in cyber

678
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:43,610
Olympics the ones the finalists that

679
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:45,780
came here they worked as a team to

680
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:48,060
respond to the challenges that we were

681
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,360
presented with we need to be prepared to

682
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:54,570
work as a team so that we can work with

683
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:57,620
professionals from different areas we

684
00:40:54,570 --> 00:41:00,600
need to be able to understand people

685
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,250
professionals from other areas it's not

686
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,830
that I'm a technician so I work with

687
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,600
technicians I'm a journalist I work with

688
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:09,270
journalists we need to be able to work

689
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:13,200
with teams from many disciplines in this

690
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:17,660
way our results will be better and for

691
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,970
that the best thing is to have our own

692
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:26,379
initiative you have to

693
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:28,750
be active both on your professional and

694
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:33,520
life and your personal life you need to

695
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:35,800
be motivated you need to be ready to do

696
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,660
things and you need to develop

697
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:42,400
creativity lateral thinking any

698
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:48,060
professional today needs to take a step

699
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:50,470
further and if there's any challenge any

700
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:56,560
problem and he's saying they have to pay

701
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:59,470
in so the daily life they need to think

702
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,590
what any what no one has things tough

703
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:05,799
before what they're here specials in

704
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:09,550
cybersecurity journalists nurses or

705
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,490
lawyers this skills should be absorbed

706
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:17,020
in their communication skills they're

707
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:19,529
very important not just being able to

708
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:19,530
talk

709
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:28,329
to talk before if an audience this

710
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:32,319
doesn't mean that everyone is to be

711
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:34,420
brave and be up here and communicate I

712
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,209
hope you will do but you're going to

713
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:39,569
communicate either orally or in writing

714
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:43,419
with many people you need to communicate

715
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:46,209
and you need to know how to write good

716
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:49,930
spelling but grama that has been lost

717
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:52,959
that's some father but you need to be

718
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:57,459
all you need to be able to do this and

719
00:42:52,959 --> 00:43:01,180
empathy the ability to step on the other

720
00:42:57,459 --> 00:43:05,259
person's shoes but I use this and

721
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:07,538
everything I do is that the basic

722
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:11,549
professional skills which have to be

723
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:11,549
added to different knowledge you have

724
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:21,919
and professional area besides your

725
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:24,529
knowledge people will also assess the

726
00:43:21,919 --> 00:43:30,618
companies you have put the attitude you

727
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:35,059
have those people that will have the

728
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:38,479
first job the first interview but first

729
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:41,299
jobs in which we send civvies we send

730
00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:50,569
CVS you have to look for a job people

731
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:54,589
don't go looking for you when people

732
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:58,788
face the first job they come from

733
00:43:54,589 --> 00:44:01,390
vocational training from university they

734
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:04,549
have a CV which is similar to see their

735
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:06,379
colleagues is CV it's the same knowledge

736
00:44:04,549 --> 00:44:10,009
because they followed the same studies

737
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:14,630
the same and when you have the same what

738
00:44:10,009 --> 00:44:18,589

739
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:21,009
things he does but what to make what

740
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:23,828
makes you different

741
00:44:21,009 --> 00:44:29,479

742
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:31,959
CV how can you be different you need to

743
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:31,959
do things

744
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:41,170
today there are many opportunities to

745
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:46,060
try to do things and eat include those

746
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:47,800
things in your CV that shows that you're

747
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,430
acting you have initiatives for example

748
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:54,520
having a blog where you develop the

749
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:58,480
different things you try or you come to

750
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:00,880
an event and you comment the lectures

751
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,800
you create content and you publish that

752
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,400
content and that blog will become

753
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,530
reference for people I will see that

754
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,530
besides starting the same thing as your

755
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:13,630
neighbor you have done something else it

756
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:17,620
doesn't matter how little these things

757
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:19,450
they are but it shows initiative you did

758
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:21,089
have some help platforms to share the

759
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,819
things you've developed because

760
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:26,320
recruiters will be able to see what

761
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,560
you're doing it doesn't matter how

762
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:31,900
little they seem that those things make

763
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,480
it difference take part in hackathons

764
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,950
programming hackathons you're showing

765
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,030
your attitude are showing that you're

766
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:42,220
truly interested in this or city apps if

767
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:46,450

other people you need to do things you

770
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:56,910
cannot stay still I never stayed still

771
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:59,849
in my personal life I did things

772
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:06,269
and I didn't know where I was headed I

773
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:09,950
still don't know but I did things and

774
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:09,950
those things are important

775
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:19,288
the assistant chair is very comfortable

776
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:22,439
but you need to take part in events or

777
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:26,220
attend events there are examples from

778
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:30,269
different communities that show the time

779
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:33,930
for many young people and that talent

780
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:37,109
helps them have opportunities to be here

781
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:40,890
and give the other talks and how can

782
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:42,869
beers people talk break the eyes their

783
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:45,200
practice the communication skills they

784
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:47,759
break the eyes and do things and then

785
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,578
networking taking advantage of this

786
00:46:47,759 --> 00:46:53,039
moment how many here besides attending

787
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:58,380
workshops and conferences are using

788
00:46:53,039 --> 00:47:00,920
networking periods she make contact with

789
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:04,380
people up here or among yourselves and

790
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:07,200
the others aren't he taken advantage of

791
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,359
networking moments to get to know

792
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,029
professionals not just from up here but

793
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:14,400
around you do you know what people

794
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:16,589
around you can provide if they're here

795
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,950
they have a common interest you shared

796
00:47:16,589 --> 00:47:21,029
an interest with them talk to them you

797
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,069
need to take advantage of these

798
00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:27,630
opportunities to become different from

799
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:30,529
others and before finishing my talk I

800
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:34,670
would like to share with you my recipe

801
00:47:30,529 --> 00:47:36,900
with the things that in my opinion

802
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:40,680
should make you different from other

803
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:44,280
people I think any person should have

804
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:50,890
this first of all

805
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:54,190
professionalism whatever you do you need

806
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:58,029
to be professional you need to prove

807
00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:01,240
that you take things seriously that in

808
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:04,000
your area of expertise you're serious

809
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,209
you're professional I have no experience

810
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,200
it's okay

811
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,790
profession being professional is not

812
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,589
just having a tough experience I'm

813
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:13,990
mainly professional because I'm serious

814
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:17,320
at what he do it may be professional

815
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:20,709
when I do my school homework and I

816
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,030
shower abilities learning the ability to

817
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:29,070
learn that's something you should never

818
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:31,300
lose you need to learn whatever you can

819
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:35,320
learn anything about nothing to do with

820
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:38,080
you I've been in many talks many events

821
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:41,290
where people talked about things that

822
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:44,610
sounded like science fiction for me like

823
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:47,860
this actor of mentioned the beginning

824
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:49,990
they started to talk about reversing in

825
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:53,290
many other things and I didn't have a

826
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:56,200
clue what they were talking about now

827
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:59,950
I'm not that lost but I'm still lost

828
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:05,379
with many things but I'm still hungry I

829
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:08,529
wanted to learn being constant if you

830
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:11,530
try something don't throw in the towel

831
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:15,190
three days later be constant after a

832
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:17,620
while you'll see whether this something

833
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:22,080

concerned everything you do attitude

835

competence but your attitude how do you

837
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:32,160
face

838
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:39,590
things you do both at a personal and

839
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:39,589
professional level I'm here and I go on

840
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:48,060
gratitude we need to have the word

841
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:50,430
things in our life in a mouth for

842
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:53,970
everything I thank everyone for

843
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,890
everything you need to be humble we

844
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:58,830
don't know everything we learned so much

845
00:49:55,890 --> 00:50:02,220
from so many people and all the time

846
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:04,380
every time you'll find someone to thank

847
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:07,649
you thank someone today and tomorrow

848
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:10,350
someone will thank you because you would

849
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:12,210
have given them something is it that

850
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:13,740
difficult to say thank you well

851
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:16,050
sometimes it's difficult to say good

852
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,259
morning or good afternoon one route to a

853
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:22,430
place but thank you

854
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:25,770
well it should be easy to say everyone's

855
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:31,490
helping you and the next day people may

856
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:37,650
thank you analysis skills you need to

857
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:41,100
analyze what do you would like to get to

858
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:46,370
achieve personal aspirations where you

859
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:50,130
are where you want to go don't get lost

860
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:53,790
enjoy the way until you get your

861
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:57,030
destination I'm enjoying this time I'm

862
00:50:53,790 --> 00:51:01,220
enjoying sharing all this with you and

863
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:04,860
then responsibility this has to do with

864
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:06,930
professionalism when you commit yourself

865
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,550
to this out to doing something in your

866
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:11,270
life you need to be responsible because

867
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:16,830
they may it may have a negative

868
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:19,860
consequence if you fail people and in

869
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:23,490
this recipe I add I always add something

870
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:26,250
something else that's something that I

871
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:30,029
already have I always have which is

872
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:33,690
passion passion I tried to

873
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:41,020
injecting things if I'm here today

874
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:44,770
that's because someone motivated to send

875
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:47,980
my proposition for a talk here he

876
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:49,960
mentioned that what passion he said you

877
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,850
did things with passion that was the

878
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,790
keyword and I said okay I'll try it I

879
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:58,000
don't know what can I offer at an event

880
00:51:54,790 --> 00:52:00,880
such as Cybercom but he mentioned this

881
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,110
word and I thought the same way many

882
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,840
people think of me for the little things

883
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:07,930
I do

884
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:15,100
perhaps if I came here to show what I've

885
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:16,870
done and what you can do I could use

886
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,890
part of this passion I include in

887
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:22,180
everything I do

888
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:24,879
that's why I discovered you don't always

889
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:30,450
fit what you belong to but once you find

890
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:33,370
your place you offer value to others

891
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:36,069
people have told me that I've added a

892
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:41,200
little bit of value whatever value it is

893
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:43,150
in this I've helped people so imagine

894
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,740
what you can do in cybersecurity if I

895
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:48,890
could you can I hope this has helped you

896
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:54,870
thank you very much

897
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:54,870
[Applause]

898
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,860
