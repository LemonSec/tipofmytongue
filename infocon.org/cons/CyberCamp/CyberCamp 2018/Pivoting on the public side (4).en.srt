1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,379
[Music]

3
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:20,450
well these C's summary of my

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,380
presentation or the table of contents of

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,380
my presentation

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,400
so I hope that my presentation is

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,500
entertaining so if you are not on the

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,379
technical side did not get discussed

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,070
about my presentation because we will be

10
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:45,820
looking at security elements that are

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:50,949
very important such as not pivoting

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:54,580
basic ipv6 and then we will finish off

13
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:59,550
with demos and we will be using broken

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:03,720
and skydive to to see the network

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:07,960
configurations that we have in these

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,789
elements okay so today I'd like to

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,780
introduce myself to say that I'm

18
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:18,190
passionate about network security I've

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:21,789
also been doing research on ipv6 for

20
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:26,530
many years now I've also founder of a

21
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:29,800
start-up mr. Luka I've always had a very

22
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:32,080
close relationship with encima they have

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,810
supported us a lot when we created our

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,600
startup this was two years ago when we

25
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:44,170
received the third prize of startups and

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,479
we have always had the significant

27
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,549
support from names even easier we have

28
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,520
received support between receiving the

29
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:55,479
support in the program for Business

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,110
Accelerator so he and I in the

31
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:01,600
photograph you see my partner my partner

32
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,140
and myself took this photograph in

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,060
Athens

34
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,169
so athens has its headquarters had in

35
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,760
Asia Asia

36
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:19,649
Anisa the European agency for network

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:25,140
security has its headquarters in Athens

38
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:28,490
Athens so we produced the paper and part

39
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,429
of the content of my presentation today

40
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:35,660
comes out from that paper that we

41
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:40,470
produced about security implications of

42
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:44,700
ipv6 we will not be focusing purely on

43
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:49,290
ipv6 and still will prefer a refer to it

44
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,769
well from our startup and is of top

45
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,900
concern to us and that we are trying to

46
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:57,480
communicate at the time is the

47
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,330
importance of considering taking into

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,750
account those elements are exposed to

49
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:07,530
the Internet and this image is intended

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,510
to represent but we internally imagine

51
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,930
when we expose a service to the internet

52
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:17,370
when we open a port 80 port of SSH port

53
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:20,700
or any other port which is secure but

54
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,590
that is also open to the Internet the

55
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,410
moment we come out to the Internet it is

56
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,799
like if we were at work and trenches

57
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:39,540
waiting for anything or any attack from

58
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:43,500
the enemy dmz so when two Koreas reach

59
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,519
an agreement and in the the militarized

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,060
zone

61
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,540
still there was a frontier there when as

62
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,590
you penetrate it you could go to reach

63
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,510
area and that is a social area that most

64
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,090
strongly protected

65
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,310
so I could talk about murderers and any

66
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:08,849
other security incidents this took place

67
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:13,709
four days ago only says that a new data

68
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:18,149
breach exposes 57 million records from

69
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:20,488
citizens companies etc more specifically

70
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,580
it says that this is an elastic search

71
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:26,159
service that was poorly configured

72
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,219
during auditing it was found out that I

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,330
didn't had any authentication in place

74
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,850
and anyone could access it and then if

75
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,380
you go to each other it tells you how

76
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:42,900
you can gain access to that party and

77
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,909
trade wealth you could listen through

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,138
that purge you could do very many things

79
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,139
with it

80
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:57,630
so regarding simple concepts such as

81
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:02,670
this one if you configure elastic test

82
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:04,890
please include authentication if you are

83
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,930
going to offer direct access to not

84
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:11,130
exposed to the Internet it is just a

85
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,830
database and only a web app or an

86
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,920
administrator should have access to it

87
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,900
if you are updated on this type of

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:25,220
things and in this type of research very

89
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:29,729
often we find this type of data breeches

90
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:35,450
so in terms of nuts network address

91
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:40,440
translation everyone is familiar with it

92
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:46,380
many say that not may be a solution to a

93
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:49,500
problem that is to say well everyone has

94
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,510
heard about how internet started it was

95
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,370
a network created between several

96
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:59,190
universities and it was never expected

97
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:03,170
to grow as much as he has grown it was

98
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:06,000
never expected to be a breakthrough

99
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:09,990
through our societies but still

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,730
continues to be based on IP protocol and

101
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:16,920
what is the problem as internet grew as

102
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:22,260
internet evolved there were not enough

103
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:24,060
IPS for all the devices that wanted to

104
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,330
connect to the internet and therefore

105
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,700
not was created that is to say a network

106
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,010
of internal addresses that will be

107
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,010
connected to the Internet through

108
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,010
internal

109
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:42,490
forwarded so here we have three internal

110
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:49,080
networks so here represented with these

111
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:52,830
circles all these are internal networks

112
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:56,440
private networks at your company's

113
00:06:52,830 --> 00:07:00,310
organizations and they are logging to

114
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:04,330
the internet through few or several IP

115
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:06,159
addresses can be routed to the Internet

116
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,020
the rest of the routing and internet

117
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:10,180
coming

118
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,789
connectivity is done through the dark

119
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,289
cloud that we can see here what Internet

120
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:16,919
Service Providers connect with each

121
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:22,719
other through the router and offer

122
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:29,889
connectivity end to end but what happens

123
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:34,960
with ipv6 ipv6 is not often do stand

124
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:36,860
actually it is recommended not because a

125
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,260
PVC

126
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:45,960
huh that was known to be a global

127
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:47,940
network where millions of devices were

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,000
already connected and many more millions

129
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:56,450
will be connected in the future and what

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,190
of Detectives of ipv6 is to restore

131
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:02,310
entrance network connectivity

132
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:06,900
that is to say allowing all the internet

133
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:12,720
devices to connect with each other the

134
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:17,750
idea is wonderful and ipv6 is here with

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:21,210
us and allowed us to do large simplifies

136
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:25,320
connection of all these devices to the

137
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:29,280
Internet now the concept of pivoting so

138
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:35,280
this is a definition from BBC II about

139
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:37,949
NBC about pivoting after stopping with

140
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,209
the ball pivoting allows you to change

141
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:44,570
the direction and look for the past Oh a

142
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,570
shot

143
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,889
how can we translate that into hacking

144
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:59,399
world or exploiting and post exploding

145
00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:02,310
time well often takes place like this

146
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:08,879
we'll have a private network here on the

147
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:10,739
right we have two devices and then on

148
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:18,569
the Left we have the internet with a

149
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:21,300
public address so internal traffic

150
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:23,969
cannot be routed to the Internet that IP

151
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,490
will never reach the internet you may

152
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,970
try it for a given point in time it will

153
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:33,449
be cut off for that IP addresses are

154
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,240
being juiced and then it will use one of

155
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:46,790
the ranges that are not reserved for

156
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:49,500
internal directions so what happens in

157
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:53,279
exploitation impossible ization face

158
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:58,220
when we want to pivot imagine that the

159
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:01,620
service the victim machine is exposed to

160
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:04,470
imagine that will manage to exploit it

161
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,470
then I take control over it but the

162
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:10,139
concept of pivoting is very powerful

163
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,209
because it allows us to reach victim to

164
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:14,250
therefore it allows us to change the

165
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:18,300
address and therefore to reach the

166
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,639
internal network and for that I may

167
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,649
launch attacks right over and from

168
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:29,699
victim one or often then is that the

169
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:33,389
routes of victim one changed so that I

170
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:36,209
can pivot hand reach victim two right

171
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:38,399
away and this is one of the things that

172
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:40,199
you always have to do especially when it

173
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,610
comes to exploiting and this is very

174
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:44,750
good fun especially when you are

175
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:52,320
carrying out an audit

176
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:56,730
again I leave it there now ipv6 well I

177
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:00,750
could talk ages about it and it is not

178
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:06,630
relevant for today's conference still I

179
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:09,120
would like to show and ipv6 address any

180
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:13,140
addresses starting with two could be

181
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:17,490
router to the internet so those dots are

182
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:20,069
stands for zeros and often we always

183
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,710
have these sections with zeros unless

184
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:27,750
these directions have been randomly

185
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:29,970
produced so now I'd like you to focus on

186
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:35,190
these two parts the blue one and the

187
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:38,990
green part so on the Left we'll have

188
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,990
blue on the right we have a green

189
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:44,450
what does that mean the first basis

190
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,620
stands for the network address and the

191
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:51,050
second bit stands for the host address

192
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:57,260
so what does that mean that if I'm given

193
00:11:51,050 --> 00:12:02,180
control of an X Network the rest of the

194
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:07,130
64 bits could be redirected as I would

195
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:11,050
like to in my network 64 bits 2 to the

196
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:15,680
power 64 how much is that that is a lot

197
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:18,219
so there is also debate in ipv6 about

198
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:24,949
the following some administrators says

199
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:31,640
why so much free directory to given to

200
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:34,820
ordinary users because the 64 bits is

201
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,640
the ordinary access that you give to any

202
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:40,820
network and in network we should have a

203
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:47,540
minimum of a prefix of 64 bits

204
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:51,700
Ayana and our i as recommend using 64

205
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:55,699
subnets everywhere in your network and

206
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:59,480
including point-to-point links this is

207
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:02,240
when hosts connect to each other through

208
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,160
a network and the work in between them

209
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,160
to the never has two addresses

210
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:15,090
so in ipv4 we have the address and the

211
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:19,130
broadcast addressed and these are the

212
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:22,320
two addresses in between the two devices

213
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:25,770
how did you direct that for large

214
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,880
customers often large customers Gary -

215
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:36,900
48 prefix medium customers care of 46

216
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:40,560
prefix well we are not going to go into

217
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:44,490
all the detail about subnets somebody's

218
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,040
an ipv6 will reach your homes if you

219
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:51,720
don't yet have it you should have been

220
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,209
given that 64 prefix which is very good

221
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:57,540
to play around with it I can assure that

222
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,310
to you and I told you before there are

223
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:04,380
very low costs

224
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:10,890
to a land having a good I be v6 with a -

225
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:15,420
64 prefix all for you and vertical we

226
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:20,340
post it to github this paper that we

227
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:24,390
have produced and you may download it

228
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:28,320
and has the project is based on the demo

229
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:31,020
that I will be sharing with you now well

230
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:35,490
it is based on docker

231
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:40,829
so you will have to install the relevant

232
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:42,720
dependencies and it is based on skydive

233
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,270
which is a project I would like the

234
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,200
large another nice to see the topography

235
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:51,360
of a web browser in all the machines

236
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,420
that we will be starting ok I will start

237
00:14:51,360 --> 00:15:01,070
with virtual machine I have an eye cell

238
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:04,579
with VirtualBox here and I will start it

239
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:08,399
well it has projects and all the

240
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:12,240
components installed you may install it

241
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:21,450
locally or in a virtual machine the

242
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:23,820
virtual machine that I am using now well

243
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,339
I could install it here but it is not

244
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,700
very difficult to install it is based on

245
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,700
Kali

246
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:47,550
I just love that you can read or not I

247
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:47,550
am starting with script with a setup

248
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:54,479
you see all the environments being

249
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,689
started we have the elasticsearch

250
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,060
skydiver everything is automatically

251
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:03,100
configured then we are starting the

252
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:07,380
different machines we have referred to

253
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,380
them as victims and now

254
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,660
I will show you these docker compose for

255
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,420
those of you who are not familiar with

256
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:31,310
it this is a file that when you set up

257
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:33,219
taka you ask this system to you tell the

258
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:37,189
system the machines that you wanted to

259
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:42,680
start for you so these are all the

260
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:46,100
victim machines these are all the docker

261
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,839
images and this is configuring the

262
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,740
project you don't have to do it yourself

263
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,760
and then I tell him that the hosts a

264
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:58,340
victim will have two IP addresses and

265
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:07,209
ipv4 which is internal and an ipv6

266
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:07,209
address and everything is ready

267
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,860
okay and this should open automatically

268
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:27,569
so this has specific attacks of ipv6

269
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,430
that representatives in our project but

270
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:33,620
because they are not the object of this

271
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:38,730
presentation and this window is the way

272
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:43,379
we will close it so this is my colleague

273
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:46,680
machine and I will expand it now so we

274
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,010
are here we see all the nodes at the

275
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,200
beginning I found it a bit messy I

276
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:57,840
thought that this design was not user

277
00:17:52,200 --> 00:18:01,010
friendly so to speak but I'll explain it

278
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,870
to you this is my Cali machine

279
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:07,320
represents a local host of the virtual

280
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:10,860
machine and each of these red pink

281
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,649
circles is Stanford token machines with

282
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,610
the own network configuration that we

283
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:20,310
have defined in the docker compose I

284
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:23,010
will continue to extend it because these

285
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,169
things that we are seeing here in jello

286
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:30,930
well these that I'm pointing out is an

287
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:33,990
intermediary device it's a bridge but we

288
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:37,020
consider it as device you can see it has

289
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,490
its own ipv4 address as well as its own

290
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,490
ipv6 address

291
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:56,740
each of its machine has and IP address

292
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:59,680
sorry network address okay

293
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:03,700
victim five starting back five three and

294
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:08,040
then in these pink square we have a

295
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:12,820
symbol for interface then we click on it

296
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:18,700
and we see the network configuration ten

297
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:25,179
sixteen 253 to a zero to sixteen 33 this

298
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:27,850
- 64 means that the first 64 bits are

299
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,310
for the network address and the last 64

300
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,530
bits are for the host address if we were

301
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:36,100
to click another one for instance this

302
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:41,920
one here you will see that says 82 so

303
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:45,070
this is the fixed part of it the first

304
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,350
part the first 64 bits are fixed because

305
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,480
they belong to the same network and what

306
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:53,800
changes it what comes at the end of the

307
00:19:49,480 --> 00:20:03,300
address the good thing about it is that

308
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:08,250
I have started my environment and now

309
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:10,490
go to machine process to this machine

310
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,490
here

311
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:31,540
the conductivity I can do in a map 1016

312
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:31,540
to 5 3

313
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:39,770
so some services are open so therefore

314
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:42,409
that means it could be any host so you

315
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,620
kind of see it just read it yes I'll be

316
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,620
no

317
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,629
I could also - SSH

318
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:01,490
and this is ipv6 address I'm starting to

319
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,409
have connectivity and then SkyDrive is

320
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:07,429
very nice when there is connectivity at

321
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:11,540
any points then you get these red lights

322
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:14,780
now I'm going to configure in my

323
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:17,750
interface an ipv6 address from the

324
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,030
address that have been started in Dhaka

325
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:26,900
so that I can gain access to ipv6

326
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:29,410
address of those hosts okay I will

327
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,410
assuming

328
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:42,930
I'm victory ipv6 addresses this one here

329
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:46,530
what we cannot go into this one how you

330
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:51,140
have config it is zero I asked it to

331
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,139
configure ipv6 address for me

332
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,410
okay we'll go back to network

333
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:44,350
configuration so we see with that we

334
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:46,840
have ipv6 address configured with a

335
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:49,510
prefix that we have and this gives us

336
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:53,678
access to a burnt ocher machines so this

337
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:56,429
is a pv6 address LLL see if I can do be

338
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,429
pink

339
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,480
that machine well no problem and do that

340
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:07,240
another assimilate let's change the

341
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,049
configuration of these environments like

342
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:15,400
if it were to configure the DMC the

343
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:17,799
public part and that private part in my

344
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:21,309
Callie I'm going to configure a public

345
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:24,220
IP before a v4 address and I'm going to

346
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:25,418
change these public address with another

347
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,990
public address

348
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:35,260
therefore I go to interface I do if

349
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:37,870
config and interface and then I would be

350
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:45,400
sixty six seven seven eight four four

351
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:51,040
and you'll see how network configuration

352
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:53,320
changes can you see it has changed and

353
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,710
that network element which is this one

354
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,799
here and that will communicate with our

355
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,320
colleague right away in my IP v4 has

356
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:04,780
given a public directional pretty

357
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:08,049
similar in that it is an IP of our DMC

358
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:12,129
who a server that has is exposed to

359
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:15,850
given service and then we have Holly we

360
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:17,980
have a icon for our interface 0 this one

361
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,590
here

362
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,380
so we see the never configuration that

363
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:25,629
I'm entering I will be changing that and

364
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:31,870
I will say instead of this one instead

365
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:37,450
of disentangle bun I want to I will be

366
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:41,080
entering a public address six is seven

367
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:45,639
seven five four point eight nine as you

368
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:51,570
wish I will be changing that and what

369
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:58,168
will happen now you will have access to

370
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:58,168
six six point seven seven eight eight

371
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:07,409
all right and what will happen if I try

372
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,740
to do ping to Joe start having

373
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:12,330
internally redirected here can you

374
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,510
remember some of them for instance okay

375
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:20,059
let us go for this one okay this one

376
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:20,059
here since 1653

377
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,980
[Music]

378
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:29,130
I can see that I cannot access them

379
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,630
because it tells me that destination the

380
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,630
book cannot be accessed

381
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:37,899
so the configuration and the language

382
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:41,860
behind it simulates the internal

383
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:44,350
configuration of organization which is

384
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,659
in the nut and outside we have different

385
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:49,689
nodes communicating to the internet but

386
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,580
an existing ipv6 you don't get nuts so

387
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:55,180
therefore these network configuration

388
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:58,990
that we see here can continue to be

389
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:02,170
routed to the Internet and what as it

390
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:04,240
often happen in the world of ipv4 if

391
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,190
from my Callie I want to attack any of

392
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,540
these internal machine well I move on to

393
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:28,750
pivoting concept I attack this public IP

394
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:31,570
then I check these services in it Syria

395
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,760
support some of them a filtered I have

396
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,429
one open I could attack a good lunch and

397
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,680
exploit and once I'm inside I can access

398
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:42,610
any of this machines but as you can

399
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:46,480
imagine with ipv6 if there a director

400
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:49,990
and this is behind may I may access that

401
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,570
perhaps so let's see this one here let's

402
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:55,020
see if I can arrive with my current

403
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,020
configuration

404
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:18,149
so I arrive I connect and I can lunch

405
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:22,139
and an aim ap discover the ports they're

406
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:25,580
open so I connect can connect to that

407
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,580
host through SSH

408
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:37,580
and we see that we have a private

409
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:42,530
rerouting and we cannot arrive the place

410
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:46,520
where we are and we have access because

411
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:48,620
we have the ipv6 address which is

412
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,720
exposed and we're connected to it and

413
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,469
you can see how we're generating this

414
00:27:50,720 --> 00:28:00,770
traffic through this call machine which

415
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:06,920
is here and I'm connected and I didn't

416
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:08,660
have to exploit I pivoted any questions

417
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,210
so far and you lost

418
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,370
I have a question of the back am I

419
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:23,230
allowed to take questions before the end

420
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:25,689
I guess I am now

421
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,790
let's see other real cases then we come

422
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:32,919
back to this environment whenever you

423
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:38,290
want we have this environment here Cal

424
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:40,150
has an eye a public address this one and

425
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,990
also a public address but the others are

426
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,750
internal

427
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:47,080
but ipv6 addresses when they come to a

428
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:53,620
network went when we want to reroute we

429
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:55,449
do this thing F Justin with regards the

430
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:59,290
firewall and other issues well we can do

431
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:02,049
it I think it's rather well you were

432
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,210
scanned with ipv4 you were given the

433
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:08,168
same service and with this can do an IP

434
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:13,950
v6 same host use you had a different

435
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:16,900
services now okay I'll exit this I

436
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,770
cannot well I change the configuration

437
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,770
and I will see it

438
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,929
this is this machine here 53

439
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:47,809
53 we can configure this with 10 this is

440
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:53,389
an interesting question

441
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:53,389
because I'll explain now the notion

442
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:09,139
I'll use 1016 here I use this so that we

443
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,440
don't have collisions let's see if I

444
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,440
arrive there

445
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:23,650
what was it 53 right and I'm ap I think

446
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:23,649
it's regular right

447
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:41,330
22 for 43 Friday and map by an MEP 253

448
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:44,210
this is the same one in the network

449
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:49,178
configuration they were not confused and

450
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:52,740
address is the same for ipv4 and ipv6

451
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:55,110
you see is the same one

452
00:30:52,740 --> 00:31:01,409
it's interesting that you say that

453
00:30:55,110 --> 00:31:04,139
because a dual stack concepts present

454
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:06,590
that the host at the ends as ever said

455
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:10,980
the end are the same ones but very often

456
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:13,830
the exposed bolts can change why because

457
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:16,880
the filtering you do I before does not

458
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:20,610
take place in ipv6 and that's the mess

459
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,549
because how many of you know about cyber

460
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:25,408
tables I'm sure most of you or at least

461
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:27,960
you've listened you've heard about them

462
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:31,100
but you know how to configure out to be

463
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,820
tables an ipv6 well less because it's

464
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:36,240
ib6 tables

465
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,039
so unfortunately ipv6 has a series of

466
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,140
advantages and is rich in many

467
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:43,860
environments and inference structures at

468
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:46,230
this cloud environments but people do

469
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,678
not have the skills or it's hard for

470
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:54,649
them to see did your speed they don't

471
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:57,149
bear in mind that when were using ipv6

472
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:59,100
when it's a bear in mind that it's a

473
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:01,168
different interface with a different

474
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:04,049
routing that offers an access to the

475
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:07,860
same machine and we'll see examples in

476
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:11,840
which the open ports in foreign 6 do not

477
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,840
coincide in real environments

478
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:26,880
real world what about ipv6 what this

479
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:30,250
doesn't exist in Spain we don't care

480
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,980
it's the future protocol but it hasn't

481
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,510
here yet it regardless of the statistics

482
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,570
you see in the internet Google to the

483
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:39,580
25% of its traffic it's in ipv6 or one

484
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:43,450
out of four connections as ipv6 and

485
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:45,460
their carriage is just T Mobile which

486
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:48,970
has 90 percent of the traffic in ipv6

487
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:51,130
most likely you know companies

488
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:52,390
organisation to have things in Amazon do

489
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:56,040
you know anyone that has something in

490
00:32:52,390 --> 00:33:00,670
Amazon well this is what Amazon says I

491
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:03,600
was a little private cloud is the famous

492
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:03,600
VP sees

493
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:13,289
we can have availability sounds which

494
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:15,509
are the sound in which Amazon generates

495
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:19,908
a sort of data center availability for

496
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:25,019
creating virtual machines this subnet

497
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:29,100
10-0 something internal but see the ipv6

498
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:32,039
it says /x de for start with 2 so it

499
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:36,799
inaudible to the internet and it says

500
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:39,210
that the that the machines raised here

501
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,830
you have to be careful with this because

502
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:47,220
the main cloud providers has her Amazon

503
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:50,850
Google cloud platform have ipv6 and many

504
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:56,990
machines many V pcs have been raised

505
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:56,990
without having security considerations

506
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,439
that's is something else that people say

507
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:07,610
when they face ipv6 they say if I can

508
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,850
figure my ipv6 addresses randomly

509
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,710
they're difficult to guess perhaps the

510
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:17,719
attackers want to know what my machines

511
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:20,929
are located the notion of pivoting is

512
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:23,239
not I exploit a machine to get to the

513
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:25,100
others I can get to all of them I just

514
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:27,439
need to know where they're located how

515
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,529
can I know which machines belong to a

516
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,950
specific organization well I'll ask this

517
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:37,180
question later let's see how some

518
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:39,439
organizations are working with ipv6

519
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:46,569
rerouting they do things such as this

520
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:49,429
one a certain domain at work scope

521
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:52,070
change it from one seven three to four

522
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:56,719
five six zero one eight three two it's

523
00:34:52,070 --> 00:35:00,590
very accessible and it's included into

524
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:03,500
the ipv6 address they generate this is

525
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:06,040
the network address and this is the host

526
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,040
address

527
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,319
how do you think we can know whether

528
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:17,710
another host and other ipv6 address

529
00:35:14,319 --> 00:35:21,160
belongs to that same organization let's

530
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:25,230
imagine analyzing that organization I am

531
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:29,440
cannot but I'm doing pen testing and I

532
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:31,000
already have this ipv6 address how can I

533
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,299
know whether this one belongs to the

534
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,289
same organization with the network

535
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:45,579
address of course let's see another

536
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:52,539
example other people have assigned to

537
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:56,170
these prefix 2001 41 D whatever they

538
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:58,750
take their regular ipv4 address the RAF

539
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,339
traditional traditionally have they've

540
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,010
been administering for a long time and

541
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:05,200
they include it like that if you

542
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,789
translate into bits it's not different

543
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,109
because this is decimal and this other

544
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:14,440
thing is hexadecimal but so that it's

545
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:18,660
more legible more manageable many

546
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:22,269
organizations are doing this so this

547
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:25,420
could give us a clue if we know the

548
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:28,419
public ipv4 address of organization we

549
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,890
can check whether it is in ipv6 there's

550
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:34,539
something interesting here these are

551
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:35,129
real domains I'm not showing sensitive

552
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,990
information

553
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:43,060
deme domains

554
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:46,270
that of nothing in common apparently at

555
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:51,430
first iced this like intelligence test

556
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:54,940
find the differences well if you see

557
00:36:51,430 --> 00:37:00,700
ipv4 addresses in ipv6 ipv6 in a

558
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:04,270
beauties for we see the same three

559
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:06,970
blocks are the same ones but in ipv4 if

560
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:08,530
you give me two addresses I cannot know

561
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:10,029
if they belong to the same organization

562
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:12,760
never I'm not using additional

563
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:13,930
techniques just with the IP address I

564
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,590
cannot know

565
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:20,500
however with ipv6 what happens if you

566
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:24,310
try this if you try to solve this you'll

567
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:27,390
see that the prefix is exactly the same

568
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:30,009
what tells you what does it tell you

569
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:33,879
from an infrastructure management and

570
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:38,369
network point of view they all this host

571
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,369
in domains are related

572
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:46,890
and what happens these are virtual

573
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,959
devices that are generated in this

574
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:57,760
environmentally known maintained in the

575
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:00,330
same infrastructure the routing goes to

576
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,330
the same place

577
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,609
could we guess or the house there well

578
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:12,580
it shouldn't be too difficult the

579
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:18,760
internal domains generated for it I P

580
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:21,810
are quite predictable and now based on

581
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,810
the question if asked

582
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,029
this solution we have a mr. look at

583
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:42,870
experimental level they started we

584
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:45,150
created the what we do is combining ipv4

585
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:47,400
and ipv6 this is not available in the

586
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,800
Internet we expected to be available

587
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,340
over the next weeks and I'll show this

588
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,730
to you now it's important to show the

589
00:38:53,340 --> 00:39:01,380
concept there's a host an element final

590
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:04,710
docket talker in this case with this

591
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,380
weird name that may have two interfaces

592
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:09,510
and each one of them has different ports

593
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,890
you get there through different parts

594
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,140
you filter here perhaps you're not

595
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,509
filtering the other side and device

596
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:17,730
versa

597
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:22,880
babs you filter in a before but not a 96

598
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:26,040
and it's very often what we see is that

599
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,320
these security policies are not being

600
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:32,310
considered are not being properly

601
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,880
considered the goal of mr. lecoeur

602
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,880
project

603
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:48,749
is combining ipv4 domain IP v6 to show

604
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:52,670
that the device behind it is the same

605
00:39:48,749 --> 00:39:59,519
one and therefore it is important to

606
00:39:52,670 --> 00:40:03,420
apply the appropriate filter the

607
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:07,649
appropriate network configuration this

608
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:11,880
host is domain if you fly in map or you

609
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:16,259
solve ipv4 address and then ipv6 address

610
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:19,289
and you apply and mapa to it stack

611
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:21,779
you'll see there are differences we

612
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:24,749
wanted to point this out and that's why

613
00:40:21,779 --> 00:40:26,569
we mark in red ports with scene one side

614
00:40:24,749 --> 00:40:29,549
and we don't seem to the other ones

615
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:32,730
doesn't mean that it's safer in IP 4 and

616
00:40:29,549 --> 00:40:34,920
I've been and not in MV 6 it doesn't

617
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,900
make sense for it to be different as of

618
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,980
today if they have the same network same

619
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,980
access through the internet why the

620
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:52,529
configuration is different in stock ipv6

621
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:54,829
and ipv4 other examples that I want to

622
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:54,829
show

623
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:10,490
I've

624
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:16,099
I have some queries here let's try with

625
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:21,348
this one with another one who has open

626
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:24,200
polls and now you would say well it's a

627
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:29,529
compliment it's it isn't better or worse

628
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,529
it just complimented a vision I love you

629
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:47,618
let's take an I piss ipv6 address which

630
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:47,619
is there's one and it's carried a search

631
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:57,288
I don't know whether we're going to get

632
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:01,640
something but could anyone tell me what

633
00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:03,559
I'm trying to do with this query as a

634
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,609
matter of fact I could remove the host

635
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:11,559
address it doesn't it's not necessary

636
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:14,269
I'm trying to obtain all the hosts that

637
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,579
may be somehow related to this other one

638
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:19,129
why because I'm using the address and

639
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:21,349
the prefix to search I don't know what

640
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,950
I'm going to obtain besides the one I

641
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:24,799
already have

642
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:29,720
well we have seven different machines

643
00:42:24,799 --> 00:42:36,019
have been different IP addresses we have

644
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:38,839
this case we have this domain there's

645
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:42,740
nothing in IB v4 in ipv6 we have this

646
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:46,660
address and we have an SSH port which is

647
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,660
open with a good vulnerability

648
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:56,459
this has a potential because if you

649
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,960
don't have the right security policy

650
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,680
you'll have a problem because if someone

651
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,030
knows one of your IP v6 addresses and

652
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,069
they want to pivot because they're not

653
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:10,440
interested that machine they can guess

654
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:12,430
whether that organization has other ipv6

655
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,800
addresses which are exposed to the

656
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:17,500
Internet they just need to discover ipv6

657
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:24,820
addresses which also belong to the same

658
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:29,530
ipv6 prefix and look how simple it is

659
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:33,790
sometimes to find security breaches when

660
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:36,610
you find open ports well this was my

661
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:40,029
presentation we have five minutes more

662
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:43,360
we can have a Q&A or we continue with

663
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:57,430
the practical side of this any other

664
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:59,380
question comment down to the example and

665
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:01,629
pivoting we've seen we've seen that when

666
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,790
we have a network configured as private

667
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,650
we access the first machine and from

668
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:08,550
that we can pivot in the second one you

669
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:13,060
know be visit six if I access a machine

670
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:17,619
with an address can I then access a

671
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:20,759
network is configured as local link can

672
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:24,090
I jump from one IP to the other yes

673
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,090
let's imagine

674
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,060
we have our environment

675
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,600
I'll use the ssh access

676
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,950
I'm inside the machine

677
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:08,220
we have internal routing ipv6 public

678
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:11,520
address but also dealing local routing

679
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:16,049
this routing starting with F II is the

680
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:19,440
one you can see in a BB six both in

681
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:24,960
Linux and Windows systems with the

682
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:28,080
productions this routing is it's not the

683
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,960
equivalent to ipv4 because it behaves

684
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,660
differently this network addresses how

685
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:39,600
to automatically generating generated in

686
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:41,609
any interface has an a local address in

687
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,810
ipv4 we have to configure it ourselves

688
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:48,810
but as soon as we happen interface we

689
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:51,270
need an ipv6 address in link-local it's

690
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:54,480
usually generated based on the MAC

691
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:57,090
address of the interface what do we need

692
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,810
this interface in order to have

693
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:05,370
immediate connectivity with nodes in the

694
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:13,320
same domain in the same land connect to

695
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:18,660
the same switch so LIC MVP's six

696
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:22,160
protocols are used and I'm going to try

697
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,160
something I'm not sure it works

698
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:33,750
minotaurs Estolano I don't even have net

699
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:36,630
tools and stored him if you access

700
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:39,030
usually the very basic Duggar machines

701
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:43,640
didn't have net tools installed that's

702
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:47,250
what you have the pin and other things

703
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,049
so he type in the proper commands and

704
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:53,490
you have the network address and network

705
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:57,000
turns this is cool in order to discover

706
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:59,370
elements in the same ipv6 elements in

707
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,760
link-local because it's a multicast to

708
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:10,140
trust in our baby 6 and deport any

709
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:14,010
machine compatible active for ipv6 have

710
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:18,029
to listen to that ipv6 address if I pin

711
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:21,180
30 tries all the active machines have to

712
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:25,500
answer unless it's filtered through

713
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:28,410
firewall at host level Linux today I

714
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:31,470
think most of them answer but up windows

715
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:35,690
but from this machine even inside were

716
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,689
compromised we get launched

717
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:43,040
I queried to see what machines are

718
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:46,850
available at Li local level but we may

719
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,460
be more limited compared to the other

720
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:51,799
approach when we go from the outside

721
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:55,940
will be limited to the switch to which

722
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:58,220
we're connected and because very often

723
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,680
there are services which cannot be

724
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:04,970
accessed from the link-local at the side

725
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:10,060
there only active on the public side but

726
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:13,009
yes we would have a ways to pivot

727
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:16,880
once we've pivoted if there's public

728
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:19,790
ipv6 we go from the outside maybe have

729
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,480
your ipv4 we go from the inside and it

730
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,480
would be a nice idea

731
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:35,920
see point one and you'll see that some

732
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:40,619
machines will answer thank you you

733
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,619
always say sick off its IP

734
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:54,960
a level rerouting is complex than many

735
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:57,480
papers written with recommendations on

736
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,030
how to manage a rerouting because you

737
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,780
have to change your mindset so far I

738
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:04,680
think it was slash 16 that the network

739
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,300
subnetting

740
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,080
that's what you learn when you're

741
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,080
training networks

742
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:20,680
and based on how they block sir

743
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:23,540
structures and I forgot the question

744
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,620
when he installed a router you connect

745
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:27,650
to a device

746
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:31,910
everything goes automatically through

747
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:35,420
DHCP what about ipv6 can be configured

748
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:38,649
without me knowing you've explained a

749
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:41,470
server when there's an HCP server a

750
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:44,870
router at home but there's a server

751
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:47,629
which is internet worth listening to

752
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:55,029
provide the ipv4 address to the devices

753
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:58,130
being connected you save your device

754
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:01,370
you're answered and you get the ipv4 bit

755
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:04,850
in ipv6 you don't even need the HTTP

756
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:08,830
server there's a Dresden link Naga

757
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:11,060
already configured if you configure an

758
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:12,710
environment in raspberry you connect

759
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:15,529
machines but you don't have any router

760
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:20,390
you have to access and configure manual

761
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:24,080
you can figure the address the IP but in

762
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:26,779
ipv6 and LAN level there's going to be

763
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:30,100
visibility with at least one ipv6

764
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:32,900
network which is local if it's

765
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:36,700
configured automatically even more

766
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,700
automatically than I believe for

767
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:47,510
we're talking about public routing

768
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:49,339
different services which proactively you

769
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,530
can figure this additionally traveling

770
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:55,308
local ends you can see there's an

771
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:58,670
important change an ipv4 interfaces can

772
00:50:55,309 --> 00:51:01,630
only have one ipv4 address that you can

773
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:04,789
change the nappy v6 there several

774
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:08,030
addresses one hundreds of IPS which is

775
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:13,010
another attack you falsified saying that

776
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:15,859
a router and some interface there's

777
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:22,579
several ipv6 interfaces and you can

778
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:26,750
create a denial of service yep you've

779
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:31,069
answered but there was quite a job well

780
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:34,549
you need to see the other side if you

781
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:37,308
take security into account we have more

782
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:39,559
connectivity potential you were more

783
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:41,329
agile when it comes to configure devices

784
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:44,059
and many of the organizers have

785
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:45,079
standardized the internet they want end

786
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,960
to end

787
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:50,839
connectivity with no intermediate

788
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:55,190
elements like cg map that covers

789
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:57,740
implement this type of technological

790
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,809
solutions they don't want them to happen

791
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:02,118
they want to have a flat and flat so to

792
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:05,569
speak flat network in terms of

793
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:08,869
connectivity and to end and it would be

794
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:11,058
more efficient it was simpler and some

795
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:16,640
services wouldn't be so complicated when

796
00:52:11,059 --> 00:52:18,920
trying to connect machines behind a LAN

797
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:23,990
network they have to show their

798
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:27,710
communication protocols what we want

799
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:29,689
with ipv6 is into end connectivity from

800
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:31,609
a security point of view of course

801
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,549
that's what we want to explain we have

802
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:36,348
to bear this in mind but ipv6 comes with

803
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:46,259
many advantages from a network point of

804
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:50,050
view if there are no more questions

805
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:53,440
either your death your sleeping or you

806
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:53,910
didn't understand anything thank you

807
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:00,020
very much

808
00:52:53,910 --> 00:53:00,020
[Applause]

809
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,250
you
