2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:17,070
amongst technical people as well as

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,110
non-technical people about the West

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,450
cybersecurity today we will be

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:26,780
discussing the Internet of Things

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:29,130
so IOT has kind of become a pandemics

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:34,129
all over the grounds had of course

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,129
including a Spain well regarding myself

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:49,340
in me so before everything well I'm sure

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,890
that all of you here are aware of crypto

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:59,180
currencies we have some of you have

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:03,360
remaining these currencies in the past

13
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:05,880
however many people are not aware of try

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,400
two currencies Oh perhaps the knowledge

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:15,320
understanding the half of them is just

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:18,750
about data has been disseminated media

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,210
many people are not even aware of the

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,560
value of capital currencies and they

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,929
don't know whether that value is

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,350
tangible or not some people wanted to

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:32,640
buy cryptocurrency they doesn't log on

22
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:36,270
to forum they just got paid ten thousand

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,210
euros and they just got a few coins in

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:43,560
return in the end but just who God was

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:47,130
kind of like a tiny metal with no value

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,370
at all so these things have happened

27
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,310
because they have not having no success

28
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,409
in explaining for cryptocurrencies are

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,880
and what to do with them a very

30
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,520
important topic he also popular is

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,850
cryptocurrency mining it is very

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,570
important to know what is mining and

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,959
where are the profit that criminals make

34
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:16,829
out of it so mining of cryptocurrency

35
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,630
could be difficult and well to

36
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,570
understand that in the plain and simple

37
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:25,140
language we could easily explain what

38
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:28,320
cryptocurrency mining is about okay let

39
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:33,089
let's use this an example do you buy

40
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:37,019
these and then you buy that and then you

41
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:40,550
heat it over and over again against

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:45,900
these frogs and then you will get like

43
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:48,300
cryptocurrencies out of it yes of course

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,700
there are mathematical calculations

45
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,040
involved and depending on the currency

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,970
may be more or less difficult to make a

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,880
profit especially compared to the

48
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:04,230
electrical energy consumption that it

49
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:07,620
takes and if you think that you could

50
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,730
kind of make a profit by buying three or

51
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,950
four graphic cards forget about that

52
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:21,989
idea graphic cards are only good for

53
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:25,730
playing games this is so because someone

54
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:28,170
came up with the wonderful damn

55
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,480
blockchain which sounds very good from

56
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,510
the marketing viewpoint behind it we

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,019
have a highly disruptive technology that

58
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,630
will change the world for all of us and

59
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,830
then it goes very well with other

60
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:44,640
terminologies such as machine learning

61
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,980
in any world presentation that you will

62
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,309
give if you mention blockchain machine

63
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:53,100
learning and any other big words people

64
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:56,070
love it and especially if you pronounce

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:00,650
them rightly in English well everyone

66
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:04,519
will be captivated and then well

67
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,650
explaining blockchain may seem difficult

68
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,690
but if I go and tell you that blockchain

69
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,750
it is just an accounting book where

70
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,459
people keep a record of transactions

71
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:20,970
same as our parents or grandparents did

72
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:22,000
so it seems that it is easier to

73
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,640
understand

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,920
an actual reality does not differ that

75
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,890
much from it and actually said this

76
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:33,730
practice technology this is kind of

77
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:35,800
falling shirt this technology is no

78
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,350
because depending on the number of a

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,970
transaction there is often a kill

80
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,820
thank you that make you wait for a long

81
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,940
time and when it comes to high activity

82
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,210
you could be waiting for hours and hours

83
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:54,490
or perhaps in the past when Bitcoin was

84
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:57,460
all aboard okay it took yes for you to

85
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,770
complete your transaction and all these

86
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,289
keeping this record has to be done by

87
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:05,740
someone that is to say keeping a record

88
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:09,670
who has sent these amounts of currency

89
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:13,900
to another person and people in charge

90
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:16,000
of keeping those records are miners they

91
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,169
charge a fee for that and that's where

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,610
they get it make a profit accounting B

93
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:30,280
and it is just somehow effective only

94
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:32,860
somehow so if someone comes to you and

95
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,640
tells you blockchain will solve your

96
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:42,070
problems because of the type of currency

97
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:44,260
because of the security that delivers if

98
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,570
someone tells you that you should look a

99
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,810
straight into his eyes and then you

100
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:53,620
should see this person to the door very

101
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,320
nicely push him out and then knock the

102
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,590
door don't you worry probably this

103
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,250
person would end up participating in the

104
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,679
round table and while giving public

105
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,520
presentations but anyway now let us go

106
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,800
back to cyber criminals cyber criminals

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,159
saw an opportunity in cryptocurrencies

108
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:19,840
and in mining they could see well many

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:23,050
people mining through their mobile

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,099
phones that PC and then cyber criminals

111
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:30,070
says well why shouldn't we make profit

112
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,849
out of it let us hug their machines and

113
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,890
then let us change what they are doing

114
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:38,380
in that machine so that the machines

115
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,690
point brass someone said well that's a

116
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,599
very good idea and then at the center

117
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:47,890
use a saddle technique in fact a chain a

118
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:53,159
computer and if you find a wallet of

119
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:53,159
cryptocurrency go ahead and steal it

120
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:05,429
however a year ago cybercriminals

121
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:10,169
realized that stealing wallets was not

122
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:13,859
very profitable because well well they

123
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:16,558
didn't find very many people active at

124
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:19,169
the time to steal the work from them and

125
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:21,839
then they can be time that they were

126
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,818
well many people go into mining and then

127
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:30,379
they could see an opportunity they're

128
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:33,239
packing occurs 2018 some cyber criminals

129
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:37,439
came up with the following idea say well

130
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:39,808
we already master technique which is

131
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:43,679
about introducing malicious advertising

132
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:45,899
on the internet or impersonate websites

133
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:49,378
and I said why don't we use all these

134
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:51,569
malicious techniques okay do that in

135
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,979
cryptocurrencies and then someone said

136
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,949
well this is wonderful

137
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:59,099
let us go ahead for dates and this is an

138
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:02,699
example of a website which looks legit

139
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,949
but had been impersonated by criminals

140
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,709
and by the time summer would click on

141
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:10,079
the explore button they would just

142
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:13,439
another miner who was controlled by

143
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:16,379
cyber criminals and not only does I'm a

144
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:19,229
criminal sir okay let us take advantages

145
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:22,919
of the searches that people make on the

146
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:26,669
internet and what people get as a result

147
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,998
and then they said okay they started to

148
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:34,078
introduce pages are converted this video

149
00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:37,949
to mp3 or converted into another format

150
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:43,739
and probably this type of links are full

151
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:47,459
of crap and this time okay they used it

152
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,129
as a way to install a minor in the

153
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,760
computer now criminals continued working

154
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:55,540
and I said well

155
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,210
but somewhere techniques why don't we

156
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:02,709
take them to cryptocurrencies and these

157
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:07,330
plug things that we post in the kind of

158
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:11,200
lated matter those that users using the

159
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,750
browser's let us try to live in there to

160
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,950
upload in there to see how many of them

161
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:19,480
are done notice so therefore fake

162
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,570
plugins continue to be there

163
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,820
people used to learn know them and to

164
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,100
random so every time people were

165
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,640
starting their computers there were

166
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:34,180
mining cryptocurrencies for cyber

167
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,780
criminals but Romano's were not happy

168
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:41,500
fully happy with that and here we see

169
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:46,089
these errands and they kind of some of

170
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:49,660
them had more positive comments than

171
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:52,870
those that they were needed and then

172
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:57,250
sometimes one cyber criminals also

173
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:59,020
infected some always systems suppose

174
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,670
some people believe that car are not

175
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:07,980
fond of an atom such as the case of the

176
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:12,430
even Apple so by

177
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:20,279
once you'll inject an up in the Apple

178
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:20,279
Store for Mac OS it is easier to inject

179
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:33,490
malware in this case we see how just

180
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:36,569
calendar nothing wrong with it was on

181
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,819
average no problem

182
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:49,750
but then included in this file we could

183
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:54,389
see a minor a minor who wallet and then

184
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,490
if you were not careful enough do

185
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:59,319
smartphone was ruined

186
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:02,589
well because intensive use was being

187
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:06,279
made of its processor and a of the

188
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:08,620
traffic cart just increasing had man but

189
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,930
I wanted more I'm sure that many of you

190
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:15,959
are aware of this website which is very

191
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,959
just fall to than the philosophy papers

192
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:23,980
what end of September 2017 someone saw

193
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:27,550
something suspicious well he was

194
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:30,399
unloading philosophy papers his computer

195
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:33,040
was kind of overworking the processor

196
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,220
went up to 100% the graphic artist

197
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,730
started to work full performance

198
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,069
something unusual if you were just

199
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,550
browsing the internet well if you have

200
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:47,829
chrome and more than 12 tabs open that

201
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,529
could be the case but that was not the

202
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:52,750
case so therefore people have started to

203
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,490
look into that and they could see that

204
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,410
for one day to the next

205
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,350
advertising was not that intrusive

206
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:02,230
however they could see covered offline

207
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,630
right in the mirror of the websites and

208
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,140
it was pointed to a service that was not

209
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,820
very well known at that time the

210
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,770
administrators of the website has

211
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,380
decided always in a profitable manner

212
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:17,260
producers but without bonding them that

213
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,020
it was much better than instead of

214
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:27,430
showing invasive advertising about

215
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:31,689
kittens that to well-to-do mining for

216
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:34,359
the benefit saying look do you mind

217
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:41,340
instead of showing to advertising do you

218
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:44,230
mind if you computer does some mining so

219
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,410
they didn't do that they didn't warn

220
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:49,150
users but many savvy criminals as well

221
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,890
that has make a lot of tired it seems to

222
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,740
work and I started to do that with all

223
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,750
kinds of websites malicious websites

224
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,080
that they were controlling and also by

225
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,880
infecting legit websites that will

226
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:03,190
strongly visited that that they have an

227
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,740
ability that allowed to inject that line

228
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,630
of code in the middle of the website we

229
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,670
will have well-known cases I'm sorry if

230
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:14,140
there is someone from Aragon government

231
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:17,319
here so the implemented using Aragon one

232
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,290
day could see the mining code injected

233
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,240
in the web site then a user said look I

234
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,270
was looking for your offers in your area

235
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,840
and my a ve has detected that and say

236
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:32,620
yeah okay the park has been infiltrated

237
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:37,450
and also the Polytechnic University in

238
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,440
Buenos Aires also was infected as well

239
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,750
as Cristiano Ronaldo

240
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,820
and then cyber criminals could see that

241
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:48,060
they could make a big profit there and

242
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:51,029
that Jews were not realizing that the

243
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:53,910
computer was working a super focus as

244
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:56,790
the were visiting some websites some

245
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:59,910
Jews as well from is all down my

246
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:07,079
computer result so it is not a problem

247
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:08,760
if it is performing move and then at

248
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:11,160
that time they decided to point at a

249
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,410
segment that had not been just before in

250
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,199
crypto mining not because they were

251
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:20,390
stopped just open they just did not

252
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:25,399
thought about that or because they just

253
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,399
had a higher level of security

254
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,839
somebody's I mean their service did not

255
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,630
have the level of security that they

256
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,579
needed and here we have some interesting

257
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,910
attacks one of them was a Scarlett

258
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,910
Johansson

259
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:49,420
well as Katya Hudson could heat the CPU

260
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,290
but she didn't do that in this case the

261
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,540
attackers appealed something it is

262
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,510
freely basic which is human curiosity

263
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,610
and a lack of empathy I'm part of many

264
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:04,860
system administrators how did they do

265
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:09,520
that they looked for specific service

266
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:12,070
data database service this one post read

267
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,370
SQL they knew that many servicemen had

268
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,620
not been updated because the

269
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,230
administrator was not going to do it if

270
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,080
it worked

271
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,600
do not touch it

272
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:30,820
so they took advantage of perfectly

273
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,680
known choose those servers were fully

274
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,810
exposed to the Internet's you could just

275
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,479
find that open port and access the

276
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,150
server no problem and then in the

277
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,470
servers they also looked for those of us

278
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:47,319
who have graphic card very curious

279
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:50,110
having a server with graphic card well

280
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,780
if the server does video well could

281
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,910
easily have a traffic cartilage and once

282
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,730
they had an information they sent out a

283
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,180
photograph of SCADA young handsome to

284
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:05,350
the account of the administrators of the

285
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:07,959
server they just didn't do that in a

286
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,450
targeted fashion they just sent her out

287
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,360
to different corporations and to

288
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:17,130
different that means at corporations but

289
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:23,490
the photograph of the actress had a code

290
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:25,760
that connected to a site used by crypto

291
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:32,510
criminals

292
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:36,339
for unloading minor so there is a

293
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:41,600
difference but between your computer :

294
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:44,410
it's no Lea then having a server working

295
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,800
and 98 percent and 99 percent

296
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:53,240
performance depending on the mining that

297
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:58,459
is taking place servers are often not

298
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:02,420
reviewed not updated so that was very

299
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:06,909
very easy for cyber criminals with this

300
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:12,409
I mean that this was not a problem of

301
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:15,679
users Pedrosa program of companies and

302
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:18,709
at the same time the server as it was

303
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,049
being mined was not performing as an

304
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:26,600
upshot server the problem that we have

305
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:31,340
with mining is that well first time we

306
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:34,309
were in the red area as it happened with

307
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,520
ransomware and with other problems these

308
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:40,250
were as these are statistics that we

309
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,820
gathered in our company for several

310
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,140
weeks

311
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:48,559
- and better understand and to study the

312
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:53,780
performance of these threat but as the

313
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:57,260
boom of cryptocurrency went away we

314
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:00,290
could also see a downward trend in terms

315
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,440
of miners or at least miners that we

316
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:05,470
knew that they were injecting themselves

317
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,690
website while we see here summertime

318
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,480
there is a decrease in the activity and

319
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,850
after summer the activity increased a

320
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,460
bit that didn't mean that they have

321
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:18,639
forgotten about it that they have gone

322
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:21,580
out of it but it were just migrating and

323
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:24,699
they have decided to do go somewhere

324
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,439
else and they said ok let me do service

325
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,559
not a limb for minding but also for

326
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,139
something else and actually they were

327
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,360
also good initiatives other than a bees

328
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:37,269
that have done development such as the

329
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,990
mining dot over gene that allows you to

330
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:45,549
see whether a website has been mining or

331
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:48,669
not and if so it is flagged as mining

332
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:53,019
website and then well cybercriminals SL

333
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:56,559
liras in fact everything which is at our

334
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:58,809
reach and for them that means any device

335
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,090
which is connected to the Internet

336
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:04,019
what is it connected to the internet

337
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:08,189
nowadays while other than of course your

338
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:12,789
laptop traveler video game smart TV

339
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:15,879
refrigerator blender Thermomix

340
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:18,750
the dual value will be given as a

341
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:23,110
present to your children Christmas time

342
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:26,500
keep thinking we keep going all that is

343
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:28,418
connected to the internet no matter the

344
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,029
size of the device Parra has a

345
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:33,340
processing capacity that can be used for

346
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:35,919
related activity offer and illicit

347
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:40,209
activity therefore cybercriminal said

348
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:42,029
well good ok we have that up there let

349
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,619
us take advantage of it the

350
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,149
that they did for something very simple

351
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:49,529
which is the closest to a laptop

352
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:52,799
nowadays smartphone and they said ok let

353
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:54,450
us develop threads similar to those have

354
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,899
been developing for years for

355
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:01,200
smartphones understand let us develop

356
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:03,869
some mine craft of cryptocurrencies and

357
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,950
tobago say well a smartphone do not have

358
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:11,519
the same computing processing capacity

359
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:17,399
well some smartphones have 10 gigabytes

360
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:22,159
of RAM so we are talking about big

361
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:24,748
devices highly powerful devices not only

362
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:28,440
currency mining but also for other

363
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:30,029
activities but did they do well first

364
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,309
they continued to use the same

365
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:34,529
techniques that they'd used before as

366
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:37,379
you do are browsing the web I either

367
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:39,509
increase the visit or I block the screen

368
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:41,580
of your mobile phone as you are browsing

369
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:44,309
any other website and the meantime I

370
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,499
just checked you and then we could see

371
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:50,489
the performance of the mobile phone will

372
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:52,349
have peaks of performance 90% 95% and

373
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:54,479
then they said okay let us also use a

374
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:57,769
technique we are well aware of which is

375
00:20:54,479 --> 00:21:00,269
to say introducing magma apps in

376
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:02,460
official applications here we are

377
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:04,289
talking about Android and then taking

378
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,989
advantage of booming of cryptocurrency

379
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:09,089
they took advantage of apps that they

380
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:12,869
had developed themselves that were aimed

381
00:21:09,089 --> 00:21:16,739
at this future new rich people that is

382
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:22,529
to say miners could use mobile phones to

383
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:25,379
manage the wallet of bitcoins or having

384
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:28,559
activities with other users with

385
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:31,949
cryptocurrency with other users on the

386
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:34,320
mobile phone so processes you search in

387
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,229
Google pay wallet of cryptocurrencies

388
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,599
you will get all these apps on the

389
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:41,820
screen and which one do you go for which

390
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,310
one to attend out the one with the

391
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:48,540
highest number of stars one

392
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:51,690
you who's the most engaging icon and

393
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,110
some users once L had the app installed

394
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:58,140
they also searched for other apps that

395
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:02,550
would allow them to operate like if they

396
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:05,960
were in the exchange market they looked

397
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:09,050
for those apps Google Play and actually

398
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,020
cybercriminals happened that before had

399
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:16,770
published absol so in Google Play

400
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:19,290
so which one shall we go for well any of

401
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:23,310
them because they were all fake

402
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:24,960
new users in cryptocurrency world would

403
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,540
not be aware of this at all

404
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,570
and therefore we just click on any of

405
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,860
them would that note any of them

406
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:35,939
smartphone will be automatically

407
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:38,370
infected and therefore cyber criminals

408
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,770
will make profit will generate

409
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:43,830
cryptocurrencies what are the

410
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:47,370
consequences for Hardware well if you

411
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:50,189
have a production server mining 24 hours

412
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:53,479
a day seven days a week that will bring

413
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:57,780
about significant losses to companies

414
00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:01,020
having a smartphone mining 24/7 in a

415
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:05,550
reduced space but battery the processor

416
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:09,980
are suffering where ventilation is not

417
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:16,550
as much as needed will make the battery

418
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:20,040
kind of get swollen and also break the

419
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:23,490
casing to have expensive fortune in this

420
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:27,450
a smartphone and then also just through

421
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:31,140
downloading these fake up to end up

422
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,770
ruining your telephone this is one of

423
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,050
the bad consequences that

424
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:38,590
from this okay and now let us talk about

425
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:41,680
well the big smartphone that we have in

426
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:45,639
our dining room which is a smart TV or

427
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:48,790
any devices that we may connect to our

428
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,820
TV smart to make it even as much and the

429
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:54,190
problem that we have now is that

430
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,780
cybercriminals came here I lived well

431
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,820
the problem here is that each

432
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,280
manufacturers use their own protocol

433
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:03,040
most of them are based on units but

434
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,310
manufacturers do not follow single and

435
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,610
standards LG has its own standard and

436
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:11,169
Sony has its own standard but they are

437
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,240
all different there has been an attempt

438
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:16,150
to introduce Android in Smart TVs

439
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:19,270
manufacture such as Sony and others have

440
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,670
succeeded actually that did not was not

441
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:25,930
related into being a sales but perhaps

442
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:29,680
the future that will result in higher

443
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:32,770
sales well this is much TVs are kind of

444
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,740
like smartphones because they also have

445
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:38,830
lots of apps and then the threats that

446
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,710
have been developed for Android could be

447
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:47,470
transferred to smart TV or to any device

448
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:49,310
which is connected to smart TV and what

449
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,230
happens

450
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,580
well you may find yourself in the

451
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,040
situation when you are watching your

452
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:58,070
favorite TV show that someone has

453
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,110
recommended to you or it just has gone

454
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:03,139
into your system through a vulnerability

455
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:05,659
and then you get two dates enough which

456
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:09,680
is they're sitting there apparently is

457
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:14,770
doing nothing you continue watching your

458
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:18,920
TV show movie but you see your Smart TV

459
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:22,190
working more more - for me more even

460
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,950
when you turn it off you hear like a

461
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,660
sound and probably they will call the

462
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,810
technician because something is going

463
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:32,690
wrong and this has been caused by a

464
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:35,629
crypto mining app that has been

465
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,460
installed into a smart TV which is using

466
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,890
the helper that you have in your

467
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:43,520
smartphone to watch multimedia content

468
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:46,370
but not only that some people want to

469
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,160
explore new possibilities for instance

470
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:52,520
the services that you have subscribed to

471
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:56,240
or not enough for them and therefore

472
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,210
they won't move so nowadays is very easy

473
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:03,950
to browse to the know the khadi

474
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:06,500
image and then to install all that to

475
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,810
connect to servers or very friendly

476
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,660
people that without asking you for

477
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:14,870
anything in exchange they ask you for

478
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:17,720
these premiere movies and also those

479
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:20,449
football games that you are extremely

480
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,340
interested in watching however you

481
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,700
should not forget that we are running a

482
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,889
security risk and one of the risks is as

483
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,440
man you said that no one changes the

484
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:34,790
password but designed to connect to SSH

485
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,640
devices so we had a same situation that

486
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:42,080
when you did jailbreak in an iPhone few

487
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,930
years ago and now it is also through all

488
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,490
these we should not forget about this ad

489
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:50,290
out I don't

490
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:53,750
so you may have well some of them may be

491
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:56,389
by design and then well sometimes you

492
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:58,700
just kind of watch all day football

493
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,310
games and then you check forum someone

494
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,410
says well if you install these other you

495
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:06,200
can play more movies you can gain access

496
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:09,080
to more content and then to go to

497
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,830
install it and to download it but the

498
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:15,260
problem is this someone okay was also to

499
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:17,030
do that and not only that wants to make

500
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,700
a profit out of that somewhere cause I

501
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:22,430
said what there many users then loading

502
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,830
of the images do not go through the

503
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,840
images are not only that they continue

504
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:30,260
to download add-ons without checking

505
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:34,000
what's inside out what did we see where

506
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:38,540
we could see dances and 2018 early 20

507
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,510
but and 2017 and early 2018 some

508
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:45,250
criminals modify these ireland's bubbles

509
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:48,470
an kiya from the main repository and

510
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:50,660
people were the lorry with no problem

511
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,630
they were downloading me they weren't

512
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:56,570
allowed in decoding images just to gain

513
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,640
access to that content multimedia

514
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,889
content but if you know that that came

515
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,380
with a surprise in it when there was a

516
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:06,040
cryptocurrency miner a cryptocurrency

517
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:09,590
miner that was installed through

518
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:12,139
Raspberry Pi device and that made

519
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:16,060
criminals be successful that is to say

520
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:19,850
heavy Deducer using that device and

521
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:22,760
small processing capacity was used to my

522
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:25,490
cryptocurrency supervisor was an account

523
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:28,250
to mine bitcoins ever in your life with

524
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:31,130
raspberry not with one prosper a bazooka

525
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:33,590
to tear through a million raspberry two

526
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:38,180
million raspberry how many raspberry

527
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:41,240
introducing in the world running of a

528
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:44,200
secure versions of coding or any other

529
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,200
applications

530
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:57,340
this was a lot and mid-august the

531
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:59,559
official repository recognized that

532
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:02,809
criminals had included non official

533
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,520
items but very few users realized many

534
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:08,780
of them are still in fact the biggest

535
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:11,600
haven't updated but seeing is doing fine

536
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:15,110
it's a bit hotter than usual warmer than

537
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,139
usual but I've bought an extra funny 90

538
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:25,000
expressed here cool it and they won't

539
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:25,000
change what about infection

540
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:32,440
Unitas day was the first country in fact

541
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,750
Adele so the UK but Spain was not far

542
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:39,210
behind depends on distribution that was

543
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:41,799
downloaded in Spain would tend to

544
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,190
download images with a different content

545
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,990
perhaps the the UK and the u.s. they're

546
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:54,280
not interested internally those images

547
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:56,020
but in the end the criminals managed to

548
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,530
do what they wanted which is use no

549
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:01,179
computers to get a profit cryptocurrency

550
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:05,399
they just needed to in fact a repository

551
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:07,690
and leave the users to the recipe one

552
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:12,250
and we have an even more extended

553
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:17,290
problem raspberries with Cod is quite

554
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:18,580
big but if we think about routers the

555
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,340
problem is even bigger

556
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,750
why because a raspberry user know that

557
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,000
they have to download any image they

558
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,650
have to copy it put it into an SD and

559
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,960
after that they have to work it's not a

560
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,820
lot to put up to do something Roger you

561
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,030
see could be anyone my grandmother

562
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:36,040
someone came installed the little device

563
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:38,020
with little lights and as long

564
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,090
everything is green it's okay and I have

565
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,879
internet at home and if something is

566
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:46,059
wrong I call technical services I reset

567
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:52,720
the router and become lucky it will work

568
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:55,990
and if not it will be changed but people

569
00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:00,670
don't care about the security of the

570
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:07,840
router if this the food password does

571
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:12,160
anyone can find using for manual or any

572
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:15,340
vulnerability this is a router and also

573
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:18,070
a recording system why they tend to be

574
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,620
associated to surveillance cameras

575
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:22,830
they're exposed to the interest but they

576
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,270
have lots of allowance without patching

577
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:29,080
this router you may familiar with it

578
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:30,850
it's from micro tech you may be familiar

579
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,429
with it it's not particularly vulnerable

580
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,800
for me it's one of the most secure ones

581
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,660
I use it for something as I love their

582
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,250
system for updates

583
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:42,360
but many people buy it because it's

584
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:46,270
cheap many technicians from many

585
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,760
low-cost carriers are installing it and

586
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,550
they just leave it there as it is

587
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,930
configured and the user does not care

588
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:55,540
about anything else and they work until

589
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:58,240
someone finds that those proctors are

590
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:02,080
exposed and they infected more speaking

591
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,450
every six cases 200,000 proudest

592
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,280
infected in a single country which was

593
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:11,410
brazil in countries such as Spain or

594
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:14,800
France there are less routers but these

595
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:17,730
devices are connected to the Internet

596
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,260
for 24 hours if it was complicated for

597
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,660
raspberry to be reviewed well my

598
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:24,100
grandmother is not going to access the

599
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,440
router to change the default

600
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,539
configuration she's not going to allow

601
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,449
remote access

602
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:35,009
and since she's added she can change the

603
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:40,209
firewall and treatable mother she's

604
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:43,299
she's going to answer she's going to

605
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:46,239
give me a bad answer well that means you

606
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:49,658
have lots lots of devices which are

607
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:52,149
vulnerable they can use two for

608
00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:55,539
cryptocurrencies or for something else

609
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:58,320
in the case of Crick demanding routers

610
00:32:55,539 --> 00:33:03,129
and deep V are the most infected

611
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:06,099
protests were Russia and Brazil why

612
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:08,439
Brazil because this devices were install

613
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:10,718
that because they're efficient and

614
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,569
they're low-cost the preservation rate

615
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:17,769
was high Spain wasn't that bad but be

616
00:33:13,569 --> 00:33:25,119
careful and this is something we have to

617
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:27,809
bear in mind criminals don't want to

618
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:31,988
infect want to three devices they need

619
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:33,789
millions devices 200,000 SEK for us for

620
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:35,199
starters but they want something else

621
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:36,549
they know there are many devices which

622
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:38,619
are vulnerable their people are not

623
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:42,668
going to update them they know they can

624
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:46,418
update them and they can infect this

625
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:50,109
this devices longer than fowl or a

626
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:52,209
computer some some botnets appeared and

627
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:56,439
they tried to focus on this type of

628
00:33:52,209 --> 00:33:58,469
devices this badness you have usually

629
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:04,389
have a name in Japanese you'll see why

630
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:06,870
let's start with Mui satori worried

631
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:11,710
Masuda

632
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:14,460
and Sora what are these names in

633
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,918
Japanese because the first one me died

634
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,168
which means future appeared in October

635
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:23,589
2016 it caused a strong disruption

636
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:26,980
it didn't make in the internet forthwith

637
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:28,989
in some areas in the US and Europe some

638
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,270
services just Netflix PlayStation

639
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:34,779
Network HBO or Spotify which are

640
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:37,409
essential for the good development or

641
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:40,659
modern life in our survival as a species

642
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:44,260
failed for ours and in some cases more

643
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:49,089
than a day and I was worried because

644
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:51,220
that botanist was made of IP cameras and

645
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:56,168
recording services such as the one we've

646
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:59,740
seen before but mainly IP cameras and we

647
00:34:56,168 --> 00:35:02,950
had never seen a massive attack such as

648
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:06,009
this one that has caused this impact why

649
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:10,240
this bottners call like this well

650
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:12,310
apparently this is the map infected

651
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,189
devices park event this is an

652
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,020
approximation we never knew the exact

653
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,660
number of devices and there were

654
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:23,470
discrepancies some people say there were

655
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:26,379
several hundreds thousands other said

656
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:28,029
dozen thousands at the end of the day

657
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:34,200
but vulnerable devices that were

658
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:39,490
available to the criminals its creator

659
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:43,089
he was the fan of I named he named it

660
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:46,479
Mirai he launched it he was so

661
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:48,640
successful that he said I don't want to

662
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,680
do anything else with this because

663
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,828
that's a good criminal I know if I get I

664
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,740
just pretension they come up to me mana

665
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:59,440
is going to come for me he's going to

666
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,660
put me in prison so he started to free

667
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,170
the code and he said this is the source

668
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:08,279
code of this botner take it

669
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:10,170
I'll just go any of you get caught it

670
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,580
will be you this is nothing new in the

671
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:15,030
criminal world it happened a few years

672
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:18,810
ago one of the most famous partners such

673
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:22,430
as series was given for free to anyone

674
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:25,200
that wanted to use the code the criminal

675
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:27,720
organization saw the police was after

676
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,470
them and they said it's time to go away

677
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,660
and many bottners appeared after that

678
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:36,810
one and the same happened with this one

679
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:39,629
this is indeed hub for any of you who

680
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:42,600
want to go through it experiment with it

681
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:47,250
always with educational purposes but

682
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:50,100
since 2016 the increase in the number of

683
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:54,600
botanists and our focus on the internal

684
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:56,460
things has increased a lot on the

685
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,470
contrary have companies and users

686
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,380
improve the security of these devices

687
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:04,799
well they can tell you that we haven't

688
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:07,560
this is a record of number of attacks

689
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,480
being launched against these devices

690
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,140
through different polls different

691
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:17,100
manufacturers a trend is of concern and

692
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:19,230
many of them have crypto mining as the

693
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:23,430
main goal although cryptocurrencies have

694
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:25,200
falling bitcoin is below $4,000 were

695
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,339
never seen this hadn't seen this in a

696
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,049
year many people have stopped mining and

697
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:33,270
they some people say that the cryptic

698
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:36,090
anticipable is over but cyber criminals

699
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:38,640
don't think about this they just have to

700
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:40,440
program the malware and they're very

701
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,950
good at that they don't have to invest

702
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,260
money in buying graphics card they use

703
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:48,720
the victims and while they're making

704
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,290
profit even if it Bitcoin which is 100

705
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:56,189
dollars we'll continue to see these

706
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:58,470
activities what can we do if there's the

707
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:01,320
this is the perspective there are

708
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:02,730
several solutions well this is like

709
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,520
everything

710
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:08,670
some of them are easy to apply others

711
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,759
depend on us others depend and people

712
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:16,230
above us but we could push them to take

713
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:20,160
them for example we could go back to old

714
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:27,510
technologies let's there were

715
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:31,470
raspberries or connected devices and use

716
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:34,950
things that worked perfectly is such as

717
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:37,169
traditional phones postcards etc can it

718
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:39,750
be done yes is it practical no of course

719
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:44,369
we're not going to do it what can we do

720
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:47,070
it we could ignore this well this

721
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:50,070
happened to everyone to another person

722
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:53,339
it won't happened to me if it happens I

723
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:58,710
don't care you get it out until it

724
00:38:53,339 --> 00:39:03,170
reaches you it's not a solution we could

725
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:06,329
press so that the legislature passes new

726
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:10,349
legislation based on current threats and

727
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:12,630
the challenges and the IOT presents this

728
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:15,800
sounds better if it wasn't because of

729
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:21,690
the fact that legislation is slow and

730
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:24,000
considering this well in 2018 it's not

731
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:26,490
go to work perhaps in 2025 they'd be up

732
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,119
to date and the that there will be

733
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:33,379
threat some judges have a hard time

734
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:35,579
understanding what's an IP or a heart so

735
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,160
cryptocurrencies that beyond the

736
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:39,780
understanding as they get retired and

737
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,779
new people can't perhaps things will

738
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:45,060
change I'm saying this because in other

739
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:49,950
countries they've already started in the

740
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:54,480
u.s. some states have already passed a

741
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:56,270
minimum legislation which requires the

742
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,910
manufacturers to comply with the minimum

743
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:02,930
safe security requirements when selling

744
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:06,569
their IOT devices basic measures such as

745
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,919
changing default passwords which are

746
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:12,190
complex

747
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:17,170
and ensuring that pheromone will be

748
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:19,780
provided or updates something that

749
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:22,210
should be basic but that it's not being

750
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:27,760
complied with today and as a matter of

751
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:32,069
fact Germany has started to prove to

752
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,069
infinitive measures which after 2020

753
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:36,520
they're going to be implemented but it's

754
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,319
going to be a sort of light thing if you

755
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,920
can plow with there's measures it's in

756
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:43,720
English

757
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,250
you can download them it's basic for

758
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,640
commendations if you can play with them

759
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:51,069
you could include a nice sticker in your

760
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,868
device saying it did there's basic

761
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:55,119
requirements security requirements are

762
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:56,980
complied with does it mean that the

763
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,900
other manufacturers won't be able to

764
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,359
sell the devices they will sell them but

765
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,579
without a sticker it's a step not the

766
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,170
one I would like to see but at least

767
00:41:03,579 --> 00:41:07,690
there's something we're raising

768
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:09,880
awareness among users when you're going

769
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:11,349
to buy your router you see a sticker

770
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,220
which is different if there's no

771
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:17,680
difference in price you will buy one

772
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:20,120
with the sticker

773
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,299
[Music]

774
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:25,759
and that's another solution forces also

775
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:31,160
necessary which is important for all of

776
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:33,490
you which is discovering vulnerabilities

777
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:37,069
the most essential ones and the most

778
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:40,040
complex ones and inform about them so

779
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:41,300
that people are ashamed but you have to

780
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,550
be responsible too

781
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,580
you have to communicate them if you

782
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,860
don't want to communicate the this

783
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,990
remanufactured tell it to the police and

784
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:53,410
they will inform the manufacturer they

785
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:57,919
will tell them you have huge hole here

786
00:41:53,410 --> 00:42:00,230
some people may think about making a

787
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,500
living out of this some companies by

788
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:07,730
theirs

789
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:09,920
legally others do it illegally but

790
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,260
hacker such as yourselves do the work

791
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,830
that this these companies should do

792
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:18,740
and they solve things for many companies

793
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:26,090
and user the one buying the router the

794
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:28,009
TV set the wonderful demotic headset

795
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,190
they don't care about that they don't

796
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:33,680
care about the security so we should

797
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:35,930
think ahead of this and we should force

798
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,270
manufacturers to comply with minimum

799
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:40,549
requirements let's see how we can extend

800
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:44,120
it but we have to start to start with

801
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:46,060
the foundations how we're going to work

802
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,240
yes

803
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:50,230
I have to work by raising awareness and

804
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,810
doing research

805
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:56,560
Yolanda goes around the for me about the

806
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:59,200
risks you when you see the wonderful

807
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,750
devices your family your relatives have

808
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,220
bought did you know how to use you'll

809
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,130
have to configure them you need to

810
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:09,520
explain the risks and tell them to take

811
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:13,900
measures so that people don't infect

812
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,390
them or install mining software thank

813
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:19,110
you very much I would like to thank you

814
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,109
for binky

815
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:24,850
allowing me to give this talk and I'd

816
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:27,610
like to think people this leave their

817
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:29,350
streaming for being there too if you

818
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:32,260
have any questions we have a few minutes

819
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:35,130
left otherwise you can kidnap me at the

820
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:35,130
end of the event

821
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:46,459
[Applause]

822
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,250
you
