00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,430
afternoon everyone

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,849
so we work at the IT engineering school

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:33,700
in Malaga I would like to thank cyber

7
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:36,670
camp for giving us this opportunity to

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,060
come here and to share with you people

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:43,960
coming from Malaga and the province of

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:47,649
málaga the various researches that we

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:53,550
have carried out up until now for you to

12
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:57,710
know what is an offer at the IT

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:01:02,980
engineering faculty here in Malaga

14
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:06,200
I am a professor the IT engineering

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:09,369
school and I've been designing security

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,780
since 1995 that has given me the

17
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:19,280
opportunity to get to know many people

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:23,030
and to teach students that are now well

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,619
known such as Ismail and that gave a

20
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:32,590
presentation this morning as well as

21
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:32,590
others so as researcher and as a teacher

22
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,860
I'd like to give this presentation the

23
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:44,660
first thing that I will refer to it's

24
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,550
about our teachings in security then I

25
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:50,390
also tells you about the research that

26
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:52,780
we do our research centers as as our

27
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,780
labs

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:02,139
Isaac will talk about other topics and

29
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,900
about all privacy and intelligence

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:09,419
environments and privacy and then also

31
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:14,130
about malware detection when analysis

32
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,130
now regarding teaching activity

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:24,930
so is my admission that he was one of my

34
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:30,420
students back in 1998 and at that time

35
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:33,450
the opportunities to be trained on

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,049
security was a bit limited because as I

37
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:41,690
said in IT engineer in the curriculum

38
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:44,280
there was only one elective unit on

39
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:49,820
security that has changed significantly

40
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:52,650
and now the university we are offering

41
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:57,530
specialization in cyber security in our

42
00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,480
master sports and also another

43
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,430
specialization as a university expert in

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,369
reverse engineering and malware

45
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,650
intelligence then also you can become

46
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,780
university expert in blockchain

47
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,490
technology and then Samsung and our

48
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:19,200
university has engaged in a joint

49
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:21,930
program about cyber security in IT

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,570
system which is specifically designed

51
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:31,790
for vocational training in students and

52
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:37,130
now masters University masters these

53
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:40,130
follows any of the wealth and graduate

54
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,130
studies

55
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:52,799
given the engineering school these are

56
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:57,030
the units some of these units are about

57
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,280
the fundamentals of security and we we

58
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:04,909
offer a specialization through our

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,409
masters course so the first semester

60
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:10,890
students follow a number of cool

61
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:18,510
subjects on security and then we also

62
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:20,339
offer specialty in data science so

63
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,580
that's X place in the first semester and

64
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,830
then in the third semester the student

65
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,659
gets a specialized in case of security

66
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:36,659
this is the specializations forensic

67
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:40,800
analysis malware analysis IT security

68
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:46,770
engineering secure programming system

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,039
security and at the end of December we

70
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,719
will be having the first promotion of

71
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,240
students in the master schools offering

72
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,000
these specialty these students has

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,720
started a mass schools in October 2017

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,210
and now in December 2018 they will be

75
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,990
finishing the master's degree and they

76
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,940
will become experts in security

77
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:13,840
[Music]

78
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:17,440
now in 2019 we will be offering an

79
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,409
expert certification or experts

80
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:28,330
yes certification in Mudville

81
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:35,530
intelligence 170 teaching hours given

82
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:40,229
out in in 11 weeks we are collaborating

83
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:44,530
with virustotal from Google so they have

84
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:47,110
office in very same building so this is

85
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:51,760
certification for experts we'll have the

86
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,740
participation of eight people eight

87
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,650
teachers including people from

88
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,930
virustotal

89
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:02,669
these will start in December and it will

90
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,669
offer further specialization

91
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,520
another certification that will be

92
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:15,069
offered as of January 2019 is about

93
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:18,068
blockchain technology this technology is

94
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:18,069
trendy

95
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:24,840
and we decided to offer this training

96
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:29,820
course because there was demand demand

97
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:33,000
from companies that were in shortage of

98
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:42,290
people specialized in blockchain

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:45,570
technology as a reason that has taken as

100
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:51,810
designed and to offer these expert

101
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:55,770
certification so these certification is

102
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:58,380
open to interpretation students graduate

103
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:05,909
students as well as people working in

104
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:08,570
private companies within the program

105
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,770
that the university of málaga is

106
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:15,000
organizing and offering together with

107
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:17,190
Samsung is about cybersecurity in IT

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,930
systems this is has been specifically

109
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,190
designed for vocational training and

110
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:26,630
students these training course is free

111
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:30,210
of charge there is a limited number of

112
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:33,719
vacancies these training course is

113
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:36,060
financed by Samsung so we have had a

114
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,979
first division already after Christmas

115
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:43,550
time we will have the second division

116
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:43,550
and then registration is now open

117
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,820
this is an article that was recently

118
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,609
published in local newspaper and say

119
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:59,630
that maraca becomes a pool of talent for

120
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,850
cyber security companies so here we have

121
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,430
another from Peters total circle from

122
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:09,950
eleven paths Ismail yes

123
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:12,590
tributes a speaker most of them have

124
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:19,640
been trained in the engineering school

125
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:22,960
here in Malaga and from engineering

126
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:26,030
school well we have we succeeded as

127
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,359
making them interested in cyber security

128
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:33,860
at a time where cyber security was not

129
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,050
as important as it is today so with this

130
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,810
I mean that those who embarked in cyber

131
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:42,409
security nowadays have many of them have

132
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,800
very successful careers so selfie was my

133
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:49,520
student is mine was also my students

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,880
Bernardo and Regina they also went to

135
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,310
the IT engineer in school so you see

136
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,760
these wonderful Italian Studies

137
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:03,260
mentioned there in the local paper comes

138
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:06,620
from one hour at engineering school and

139
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:09,650
now very briefly I will refer to the

140
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:15,160
general guidelines and what we do what

141
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:15,160
we do what we offer

142
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:24,990
so other than teaching in cybersecurity

143
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:29,029
people who are interested in going

144
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:34,290
beyond research and also to embark into

145
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:40,319
research teams internationally while the

146
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:47,480
number of people in the group ranges

147
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:49,860
between 20 to 25 some people will just

148
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,870
stay with us for some time to get

149
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,689
training and then they go and work in

150
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,389
private companies so now we have three

151
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:59,579
chapters with us some of them are

152
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:02,519
teachers are others have postdoc to

153
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:05,550
students that we also have five doctoral

154
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,889
researchers and then seven technical

155
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,889
experts

156
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:13,170
out of the 13 doctors 95% of them

157
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:16,290
started as technical experts and then

158
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:20,729
they escalated the ones up up until they

159
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:23,120
ended up being doctors and now there are

160
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,120
people who

161
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:32,170
but doctoral students okay they will

162
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:35,950
become doctors soon so we have every

163
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:40,290
such big building other Biden and then

164
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,290
we also have the IT engineering school

165
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,550
so in these research institute we are

166
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,070
negated in the second floor and then in

167
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:56,290
the third floor we've been having video

168
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,960
certain from Google since last October

169
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:03,400
one of the main advantages of the

170
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:06,480
research group what I try to do since I

171
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,230
created this group has been

172
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,790
internationalization that is to say

173
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,890
being present in national and

174
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:16,750
international fora so going abroad being

175
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,420
present internationally gives us a

176
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,390
perspective about what is being done in

177
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,449
Europe and in the world and part of the

178
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:29,560
research that we are carrying out

179
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:31,450
follows international trends so we are

180
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,150
members of European cyber security

181
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,820
organization actually we are leading one

182
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:39,550
of the working teams about emerging

183
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:42,820
technologies and cyber security we are

184
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:46,209
also members of the Huawei Security

185
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:50,020
Adviser both these and we are the

186
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:52,270
Spanish representatives within AF IP

187
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,720
which is a puritan privacy protection

188
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:57,540
information processing systems less than

189
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:04,070
a month ago

190
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,069
here in Malaga we've been presiding the

191
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:15,349
AFIP and also we've been leading one of

192
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:19,520
these subcommittees for normalization of

193
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:25,020
city and and we are also members now of

194
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:27,090
re and I see so national network of

195
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,520
excellence and of Investigation in

196
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,550
cybersecurity this has helped to

197
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:36,120
position the university of málaga very

198
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:42,650
high in the international rankings and

199
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:47,040
as I say we have very well positioned

200
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:49,350
and this has allowed us to take part in

201
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,500
European projects we've been working in

202
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:57,660
European project since 2002 the projects

203
00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:01,020
that are underway nowadays it's point in

204
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:05,280
time will last up until 2022

205
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:09,360
so in January 2019 we will be studying a

206
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:12,900
project a joint project with centers of

207
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,110
excellence in Europe our research group

208
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:20,760
and the university of málaga will be

209
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:24,090
known to the network of excellent

210
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,819
centers in cybersecurity believe me it

211
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,950
has not been easy to participate on an

212
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,930
ongoing basis for 20 years now in

213
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,930
European projects

214
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:48,450
so because our troop is made up of high

215
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:52,709
number of people we are enlarging the

216
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:58,440
lines of investigations that are open so

217
00:13:52,710 --> 00:14:00,360
now I hear we only have like masculine

218
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,630
representation of Avenue but this is

219
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,660
just coincidence because of our crew

220
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:12,150
priests also participated by 25 or 35

221
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:18,110
percent of women and I would like to

222
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:21,810
mention that even if you only see men

223
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,820
here this run table so these are the

224
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,959
lines of research which are currently

225
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:32,100
open other lots of research have been

226
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:35,250
phased out and well I will refer to some

227
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,220
of them I will not join another s

228
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:41,700
because I suck and prevent will vary

229
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,280
more specifically to them the first line

230
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,410
of research is about edge environment

231
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,470
for those of you who are not aware of it

232
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:52,199
this is evolution of cloud that is to

233
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:56,880
say bringing the cloud closer to the

234
00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:00,030
users cloud is sometime as far away or

235
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:04,590
too low for some so this is kind of a

236
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:07,350
mini cloud mini cloud offering services

237
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:10,050
and application closer to citizens as we

238
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:14,250
can see here in this parameter so within

239
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,380
this emerging field we are seeing how we

240
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,150
are looking into how to protect these

241
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:22,870
near cloud

242
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:27,250
and at the same time we are also seeing

243
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:30,880
how to use these new paradigm this new

244
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:33,580
infrastructure so that we can increase

245
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,830
the security of some of the applications

246
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:40,000
that existed before for instance

247
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:42,690
security in vehicles communication

248
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,690
network

249
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:54,940
so using these vehicle networks help us

250
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:57,189
improve security in several aspects and

251
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,620
this is some of the things we are

252
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,750
studying now the intelligent

253
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,350
transportation system in Sacre tell you

254
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,640
more about it and now security of

255
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:10,000
critical infrastructures also very

256
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:15,490
important for our working group so we've

257
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,500
been studying security anomaly critical

258
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,330
in clinical infrastructures critical

259
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,580
infrastructure industrial environment

260
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:26,050
water supply energy supply facilities

261
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,550
the IT systems in those industrial

262
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:31,479
environments have a specific

263
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:34,449
characteristics and their security also

264
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:39,640
has its own character exist that is all

265
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:42,070
evolving towards industry 4.0 and these

266
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,949
are some of the work and eyes of

267
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:48,959
research we are working on another line

268
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,959
of research is forensics IT

269
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:58,310
I see forensics I'm sure you are all

270
00:16:52,670 --> 00:17:02,780
aware of it we are evolving and from

271
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:06,849
traditional forensics now Internet of

272
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:09,709
Things and 5g forensics I'll open up new

273
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:13,189
security problems that traditional

274
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:16,040
forensics cannot solve not long ago we

275
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:20,570
created a patent for product which is

276
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:23,359
non digital witness to obtain digital

277
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:30,580
evidence and to trace those that

278
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:34,870
evidence we are going into a blood area

279
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:39,790
that is to say one of making coexist

280
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:43,459
forensics with privacy which are often

281
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:47,110
opposed each other ok this line of

282
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:52,120
research will be discussed by Ruben and

283
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:54,979
this last line of research is about

284
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:57,610
reputation and trust systems these are

285
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,720
mechanisms that help to improve existing

286
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,389
security services for instance access

287
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,780
control services so services for

288
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:08,360
management of IDS for delegation these

289
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,399
security services can be improved as

290
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,520
long as we are able to include some

291
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,800
mechanisms that are related to trust and

292
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,830
reputation morals of reputation and

293
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,290
trans staff from Miller to all of us

294
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:24,290
however bringing them translating them

295
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:26,450
into digital world is not that easy and

296
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,639
that's why we are working on that and

297
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,580
last I would like to refer to security

298
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,100
in 5vg for some time we've been

299
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:36,980
investigating and researching how to

300
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,020
offer quality of service as well as

301
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,220
security because they were kind of at

302
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,090
odds with each other

303
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:46,460
it has led us to 5g network where we'll

304
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,669
have lots of protocols lots of security

305
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:52,040
and where we are detecting

306
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,890
cific province for each induced cases

307
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,600
where we this fabric communication is

308
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:03,470
being used while 5g communication is

309
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:11,389
well now far away from ordinary users

310
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:13,640
but he will come not not in not far away

311
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,430
future and now I'd like to give the

312
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,220
floor to my colleague as caveat

313
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:23,990
mentioned before I would refer to three

314
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:28,250
lines of research that our team is

315
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:30,440
carrying out and post specifically

316
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,240
intelligent as protection system I'd

317
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:37,250
like to introduce myself my name is

318
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,810
Isaac when I was at secondary school

319
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,300
someone recommended me why don't you

320
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,580
become an engineer and then I said no no

321
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:47,419
I just want to study mathematics but

322
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:49,540
then at the end I ended up in the

323
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:54,940
technical engineering school and I also

324
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:58,100
wrote my PhD dissertation in night C I

325
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,560
at this point in time now I'm working in

326
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,360
the modern project it is a project

327
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,740
currently with Nokia and it is for

328
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,860
intelligent transportation system but

329
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,380
the first thing that we that come to

330
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:16,060
mind when we think about smart as

331
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,060
potential our vehicles

332
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:23,790
so we think about cars and cars will be

333
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,820
the main client for this type of systems

334
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:31,350
for the type of networks and now here in

335
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,120
the cars when we open up the system well

336
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,689
the cars that we have nowadays have

337
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,689
completed

338
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:43,350
the castle and embassy there is

339
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:47,620
important attainment

340
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:50,199
keela's opening thousands of sensors and

341
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:53,860
software in the hotend system which is

342
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:59,520
comparable to that of complex industrial

343
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:04,020
systems therefore now we will have these

344
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:07,930
computing of vehicles we also have the

345
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:12,520
typical threats that is to say not

346
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:17,830
reliable used by third parties related

347
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:20,889
access to communication privacy of users

348
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:24,189
data right let us refer to challenges

349
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:27,640
now that may be internal or external so

350
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:30,580
regarding internal challenges so well in

351
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,810
India we have a communication system

352
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:36,460
with different easy use as you said

353
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:40,679
units that communicate with each other

354
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:46,330
in charge of switching on the lights

355
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:48,670
serial and alternate for many years we

356
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:53,340
have had kind of a hacking culture in

357
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:56,620
cars were users connected their devices

358
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,590
well could control some parameters and

359
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:04,139
elements for instance Eve where I didn't

360
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,139
know a car broke down

361
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:11,490
so for instance there was a camera there

362
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:15,480
and then you could just add a flag and

363
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,980
then well people just to do that instead

364
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,690
of paying for an installation of the

365
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,570
flag people used to do that themselves

366
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:24,810
but you can do that to activate the new

367
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:27,870
functionality but you can also misuse

368
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:31,110
that you can also abuses not erase a

369
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:33,260
huge debate between that bus which is

370
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,209
open or the has always been open and

371
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:39,530
debates about whether to open it or not

372
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:44,700
so there was an open per mobile

373
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:48,360
connection and now what is the trend in

374
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:52,470
car manufacturers so they are talking

375
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:55,620
about the extended extended vehicle that

376
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:58,860
is to say that access that a Pampling

377
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:02,939
now has been direct that is to say

378
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:06,240
access between the user direct access of

379
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,030
the user to the car the car

380
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:16,040
manufacturers are thinking about

381
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:16,040
eliminating that gradually so

382
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:24,440
so the brand will give you the

383
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,509
authorization to access to that pot of

384
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,159
data okay this is one common the

385
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:30,829
factories are working on now and what is

386
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,659
the next step well your car is connected

387
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:36,489
to the Internet and then you gain access

388
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:38,690
to your car through the internet so

389
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:40,609
therefore the car manufacturer decides

390
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:44,059
how much you have to pay to gain access

391
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:45,889
to the data but this could pose a risk

392
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:48,829
because at the end of the day we may end

393
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:53,599
up in a monopoly let us say having car

394
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:56,469
manufacturers agreeing on how many data

395
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,820
would make available and at what cost

396
00:23:56,469 --> 00:24:02,239
but it's a problem if you don't control

397
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,989
the access block of the vehicle you will

398
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:07,389
be in trouble

399
00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:11,359
for instance I don't know where person

400
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:14,559
so we have to be aware of these

401
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,559
potential risks

402
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,670
and these examples that I mentioned

403
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:24,629
before which is real so the way L

404
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:28,110
researchers that manage to stop a car in

405
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:31,200
the middle of a highway so this bus is

406
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,389
open but how can you control a car

407
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,300
remotely and this is not only about the

408
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:41,040
data bus control but it is also about

409
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:44,220
controlling the software updates so when

410
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,460
sometimes the latest version is older so

411
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,580
we are doing a downgrade which is

412
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:53,280
absolutely forbidden in hires and in

413
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,949
Android operating system no manufacture

414
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:59,670
allows you to to downgrade because

415
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:04,050
latest versions are incentives to

416
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:08,400
improve the pre trial version and to

417
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:10,530
patch up vulnerabilities so this is much

418
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,020
more neglected history as much more

419
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,809
related sub researchers to curve and

420
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:17,820
ease of the lack of security messages

421
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:20,040
with measures because they were not open

422
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,520
to the users there were not that much

423
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:25,620
second inch account well saying this

424
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,820
would never happen but but a compass if

425
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:34,199
it happens but they changed up trading

426
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:36,570
to introduce remote access script in the

427
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,370
device and they did it because well

428
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:42,659
there was a problem with one of the

429
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:48,250
versions so the upgrading was not

430
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:51,710
properly done and what they do now

431
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:55,940
so the procedures not want to introduce

432
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:59,660
to discard the same security measures as

433
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:03,770
we have to follow within iOS and in

434
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:07,130
Android obtain is a software developed

435
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:12,620
by a u.s. person it is a standard as the

436
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:18,410
facto standard that is installed by all

437
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:25,178
the manufacturers this difference which

438
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:29,510
is the access systems is vague since

439
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:32,660
they don't know when how the system

440
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:34,700
forms they cannot break it I've been

441
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:39,110
attacked by researchers that have

442
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:41,300
understood the axis system for remote

443
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:44,149
Costanzo because it was based in a

444
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:47,780
single key millions of vehicles sharing

445
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:52,460
a symmetric key if you get the key you

446
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:55,730
open all the vehicles in a traditional

447
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:58,940
system we wouldn't do it but here it's

448
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:01,490
dark people don't know what's inside the

449
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:05,000
key they don't know the algorithm well

450
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:08,450
until they know it a researcher can if

451
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,100
this is a researcher can disassemble the

452
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:16,780
thing it can understand the code and he

453
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,780
attacks and opens doors

454
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:26,639
these are internal threats close to the

455
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:29,070
vehicle then there are the external

456
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,760
threats where the vehicle communicates

457
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:36,059
with its environment their vehicle to

458
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:40,019
vehicle communication the car talks to

459
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:42,269
other cars or elements on the road and

460
00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:45,149
their different standards competing in

461
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:48,960
the market it's what happened with

462
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:51,739
videos that read on VHS I don't think

463
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,710
many of you lived through that

464
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:58,500
experience the American government has

465
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:04,320
chosen wave and the communication

466
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:09,779
operators is C V T X this is Europe and

467
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,960
China they all share a similar security

468
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:14,970
layer the information sent by the

469
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,750
vehicle it to be authentic you need a

470
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,519
digital signature it if the vehicle in

471
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,679
front of me tells me that it's going to

472
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,570
break that I believe it has to be site

473
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:26,720
if it's not signed I don't believe it

474
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:31,950
because if you're driving in highway

475
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:34,620
someone gives you a message a false

476
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,210
message saying I am stopping and your

477
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,530
car stops all of a sudden in the middle

478
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:43,040
of the way

479
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:46,220
so vehicles send their cores without

480
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:51,020
doing their speed so that the vehicle

481
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,610
after them knows how to react and then

482
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,850
we have communication between vehicles

483
00:28:52,610 --> 00:29:00,219
and infrastructure traffic signs were

484
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:04,120
developing in in a smart traffic light

485
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:08,090
which instead of competing technologies

486
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:11,090
it is Bluetooth Low Energy it's an

487
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:16,610
energy we have on our smartphones this

488
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:21,949
allows the user users working on the

489
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:29,870
website for example to know what they

490
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:31,910
are doing there's a very important

491
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,489
aspect of communication small particular

492
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:37,040
vehicle to vehicle its speed if you're

493
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:42,230
constantly sending your speed and you

494
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:48,080
can send an ID someone can install a

495
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:50,180
sensor at your home at your office and

496
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,040
they know when he arrived and when you

497
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:55,370
left because their trunking your

498
00:29:52,040 --> 00:30:00,530
mobility the standard we have in my

499
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:03,350
dears uses Siri names so your identity

500
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:07,430
when you're saying I'm driving at this

501
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:09,949
speed that sends an idea fifty five

502
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:12,020
minutes later it's changed so if someone

503
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:20,150
is trucking you they can't know who are

504
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:22,190
you except for five minutes with regards

505
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,680
to challenges and opportunities of new

506
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,600
technologies in transportation transport

507
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:31,400
and your technologies as Xavier has said

508
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:34,280
before we are working with 5g and edge

509
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,770
computing to see how this

510
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,370
functionalities had can be supported in

511
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,370
these environments

512
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:45,530
and there's something else which is

513
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:49,430
being developed by the by companies is

514
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:51,470
mobility as a service shared transport

515
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:54,340
the final you don't need to own a

516
00:30:51,470 --> 00:31:10,820
vehicle if you need you take a

517
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:13,490
motorcycle and it's all sewn up a

518
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:19,070
business opportunity for many startups

519
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:30,230
that were with blockchain that want to

520
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:36,679
create an opportunity in this market I'm

521
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:39,310
going to give the floor to ruin one idea

522
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,250
when I tell ya

523
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:45,560
good morning I'm going to speak about

524
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:47,060
privacy in smart environments first of

525
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:51,740
all I introduce myself

526
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:53,629
I hold a PhD in IT army I'm a

527
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,810
postdoctoral researcher the diversity of

528
00:31:53,630 --> 00:32:00,380
Maya and when main line of research has

529
00:31:56,810 --> 00:32:05,149
to do with these privacy problems that

530
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:06,770
arise from our interaction with smart

531
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:12,950
environment

532
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:17,559
I've worked in other research lines but

533
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:17,559
then not related to this

534
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:31,480
why do I need privacy privacy makes us

535
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:35,679
feel safe what do we do in our private

536
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:40,720
life we wanted that for ourselves we

537
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:43,270
don't want to share that with others the

538
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,440
problem is that today our personal data

539
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:52,320
are gaining value not just for companies

540
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,320
but also for governments

541
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:09,950
criminal organizations etc the

542
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:13,370
revolution came or personal data became

543
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:15,830
a new way to pay for a service the

544
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:21,260
biggest internet service provides to

545
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:24,699
school Facebook and others provide

546
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:29,270
services to us in exchange for our data

547
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:33,770
so that your producers are security and

548
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:43,549
if we don't agree we cannot access the

549
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:45,679
service due to this high number of

550
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:48,400
companies that make a living out of our

551
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,400
personal data

552
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:58,459
the different governments have set some

553
00:33:54,379 --> 00:34:02,958
limits for example in the year I'm sure

554
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:06,379
you know but the new regulation and data

555
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:11,089
protection came into effect recently

556
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:13,190
there was a directive in the EU and data

557
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:15,558
protection the idea was for it to become

558
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:19,970
stricter more restrictive but

559
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:22,730
legislation is not enough from a legal

560
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:25,459
point of view it's ok you need a first

561
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:29,418
line of defense but we need to protect

562
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:33,020
herself because we're more and more

563
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:35,899
connected and technologies come with us

564
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:41,889
were always connected we're constantly

565
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:41,888
providing data therefore

566
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:53,990
in a research group or trying to see how

567
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:59,879
to protect privacy in this environment

568
00:34:53,989 --> 00:35:02,930
our where goes the sensor network that I

569
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:08,310
would add around us

570
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:11,960
this shouldn't be is the situation with

571
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:17,279
worked in different lines localization

572
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:22,620
location services almost every social

573
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,150
media or app requires your location in

574
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,560
order to provide you with a service and

575
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,450
we're providing very sensitive

576
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,740
information cells just why do we leave

577
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:32,250
or whether we're going to the doctor's

578
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,600
so instead of providing exactly location

579
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:38,520
the ideal thing would be to have a

580
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:43,980
balance and reduce the level of detail

581
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:49,650
of our location and instead of providing

582
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:53,460
the exact point we provide an area which

583
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:55,770
contains that point we've created a safe

584
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,340
system or secure system based on this

585
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,340
idea

586
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:06,580
the advantage of it is that previous

587
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:09,819
solutions disclosed information I'm not

588
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:12,940
going to get into detail but it's about

589
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:16,210
creating grips with the plan

590
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:19,650
there's grades of self-contained and

591
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:23,740
when I in you know in one of the crates

592
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:29,680
it provides that great as your position

593
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:32,529
and if you move the query space is

594
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:37,290
limited we're working in different lines

595
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:37,290
which is privacy in telecommunication

596
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:47,680
this line of research has a long story

597
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,870
in the net other complex system such as

598
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:54,399
tor network

599
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:57,580
they try to break the link between the

600
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,630
user and decides it visits because the

601
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:06,480
fact that we visit the website of party

602
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,480
the popular Spanish medical party cannot

603
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,600
reveal our political ideas

604
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:17,770
this type of problems which existed

605
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:21,220
Internet have been existent in existence

606
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:25,119
for a while and there are other types of

607
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:28,569
networks we study this in special

608
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:34,410
networks made up but this time of

609
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:34,410
devices with very limited capacities

610
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:52,750
these networks are installed in specific

611
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:55,599
locations nuclear power plant they don't

612
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:59,140
have much saved securities perhaps they

613
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:03,520
can reveal while the uranium who that

614
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:08,940
plant is located we have created a

615
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,680
series of traffic protocols to protect

616
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,290
the location of the events which are

617
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,848
sensitive and the destination of the

618
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,849
communications etc

619
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,109
we've caused

620
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:33,730
also worked in a different line of

621
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:37,980
research here we provide a security or

622
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:41,860
privacy platform so that when we check

623
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:44,470
data with managed by IOT platforms the

624
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:47,680
service provider that's on the cloud and

625
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:52,569
that provides with with the access to

626
00:38:47,680 --> 00:39:01,200
the sensors cannot obtain information

627
00:38:52,570 --> 00:39:01,200
about us the system is complex

628
00:39:05,069 --> 00:39:10,049
and in special different techniques

629
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:16,009
which is delegated re encryption and

630
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:18,509
other anonymity techniques but visually

631
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:23,880
it would look like this we don't have

632
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:25,769
much time so let's go very quickly over

633
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:31,489
this I'll give the floor to hang out of

634
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:36,328
them when I started it

635
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:38,999
hello my name is Gerardo Hernandez I

636
00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:43,049
work in Nick's lab we didn't have much

637
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:45,689
time so I'll go to the point in a

638
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:49,019
research we want to find the answer to

639
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:54,118
three main problems first of all how can

640
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:58,078
we obtain live more wear symbols that

641
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:00,809
are operational at some point adopting

642
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,660
honeypot system so that they're more

643
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:05,400
adaptive this honey balls usually

644
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,348
emulate systems which are active

645
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:12,109
internet have not prepared to receive

646
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:12,109
some type of marwick connections

647
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:22,930
in this sample you see as SSH honeypot

648
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:26,800
receiving a command but if we send a

649
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:29,000
different command it can fail its

650
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:34,160
command in the case of me I always

651
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:36,340
paranoid to get to the next stage being

652
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:42,649
in a way of the needs of malware

653
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:44,840
sometimes makes it impossible for us to

654
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:51,530
install the current power in a honey

655
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:55,220
butter how do we choose the most

656
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:58,100
suitable honey but first you need to

657
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:02,049
know what malware is like the snare

658
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:04,910
system this first step when it's

659
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:07,250
disseminated before it has infected the

660
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:10,490
system we need to know what it is what

661
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:14,960
it needs we need to reduce the set-up

662
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:17,180
time I need to adapt my honeypot quickly

663
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,910
enough so that it can answer to the

664
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:23,910
request we have do iterative traffic to

665
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:26,879
the new cooked honey butter

666
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:29,460
we need to manage the evidence generated

667
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,559
when the maurer is executed attack the

668
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,650
honeypot it leaves an evidence in the

669
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:37,680
file system that's this evidence should

670
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:42,950
be managed if innocent executable should

671
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:48,750
be executed and we go back to the cycle

672
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:51,328
this is repetitive this allows you to

673
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:55,440
analyze a different stage is if a

674
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:58,170
malware come bang to the first attack

675
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,180
the dropper is executed and everything

676
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:05,250
this cycle that's what we are

677
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:08,160
researching that's an important fact

678
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:11,250
which is this being familiar with the

679
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:15,078
more we're getting to know it in a very

680
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:15,079
short period of time

681
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:24,529
we can do that with more intelligence

682
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:27,920
one of her colleagues has mentioned

683
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,920
threat intelligence

684
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,020
it's about analyzing information about

685
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:38,460
the behavior of this malware and how its

686
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:41,460
disseminated how it is distributed what

687
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:44,700
rebel star is it uses information about

688
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,970
the operating system what processes are

689
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:50,160
attacked what connection is established

690
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:52,919
everything you can see here the

691
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,410
information that it can up day is based

692
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,600
on connection I can contact a model

693
00:42:55,410 --> 00:43:00,270
intelligence service I gave them an IP

694
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,490
address and they tell me what type of

695
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,680
more where this is actually didn t at

696
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:10,049
specific point in time no so through the

697
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:14,100
hash of M file I can know what more

698
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:18,630
family it is here you have three example

699
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:22,529
critical stack Intel or Intel which is

700
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:27,210
an IP aggregator virustotal intelligence

701
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:30,000
and the last one the old interface a

702
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:33,660
virus total intelligence had it's a

703
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,900
parameterised query which allows you to

704
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:39,240
look for information about a filer has

705
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,870
been just stored in your Hannibal

706
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:45,479
honeypot it can have very valuable

707
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,630
information what processes in fact would

708
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,780
record it left

709
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:54,510
it leaves in wisdom among others this

710
00:43:51,780 --> 00:44:00,960
information can be gathered collected in

711
00:43:54,510 --> 00:44:06,030
the second stage this is another example

712
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:11,180
it belongs to M is P here you have

713
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:13,370
information based in IP addresses hashes

714
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:16,319
file names

715
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:19,799
that's our analyst to get in this portal

716
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:23,670
you obtain information about the type of

717
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:27,680
evidence generated on your left you see

718
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:32,760
a column it says no it means information

719
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:35,129
is not public it's been subject analysis

720
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,910
it's useful when you're trying to react

721
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:42,630
to new more work to obtain live servers

722
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:47,279
I cannot wait for a month for two weeks

723
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:50,940
I need to obtain the information when I

724
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,460
start to provide to give evidence this

725
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:58,300
graph you see here

726
00:44:53,460 --> 00:45:01,550
shows an MIT interaction graph

727
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,550
[Music]

728
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:11,549
it shows and I be related to different

729
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,550
actions that's why we campaign

730
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:17,940
maybe yes sir if you switch your router

731
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:22,290
on you probably you can persist

732
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:24,410
something like that like this this

733
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:27,580
allows you to

734
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:27,580
[Music]

735
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:35,070
work with your honeypot without this

736
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:38,189
information we want to get results in

737
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:39,950
these three lines of research dynamic

738
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:43,440
deployment of honeypot

739
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:51,000
execution controlled environments these

740
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:53,850
are special honey pots that execute the

741
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,880
system it's not just emulation and then

742
00:45:53,850 --> 00:46:01,560
as a consequence to other things support

743
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:04,320
for reverse engineering processes there

744
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:08,250
are lot of actions that index behavior

745
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:14,520
collect information we link to reverse

746
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:20,870
engineering analysis with Ida Pro honey

747
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:28,130
bugs deployment with build wide Network

748
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:31,980
which is connected and monitored and

749
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:34,260
based on that we collect the evidence

750
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,950
and the new droppers that get to those

751
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:41,130
honey pots are subjective analysis then

752
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:42,660
we have a high interaction honeypot

753
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,850
[Music]

network

755
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:54,569
I may have an emulated Harry Potter and

756
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:56,580
physical honey pot and I get half a full

757
00:46:54,570 --> 00:47:01,550
execution of the dropper in a real

758
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,549
environment that generates reports

759
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:12,520
the formant of that evidence segment

760
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:14,680
information about the behavior what they

761
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:20,890
did when it was executed if graded

762
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:23,710
processes through science it allows you

763
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:25,390
to obtain information about memory

764
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:30,190
dumping what segments of memory were

765
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:33,970
created what calls to the library have

766
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:37,060
been infected this is useful when we get

767
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:40,029
to the reverse engineering phase we

768
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:41,890
didn't start from scratch there was a

769
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:44,800
special case which was particularly

770
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:48,609
complicated with said him honey buds for

771
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,380
IOT these devices are very volatile it

772
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:52,320
may be useful for a specific campaign

773
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:55,540
that it's smoked

774
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,880
we used a methodology we've published it

775
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:01,830
which allows you to decide which is the

776
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,830
most interesting honeypot

777
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:07,599
from a technology point of view but also

778
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:10,879
from the dissemination point of view

779
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:15,879
they're not easy to emulate if we just

780
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:22,519
want to emulate services just have to

781
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:25,699
set up a bacheior similar thing if we

782
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:32,899
want data interaction way to execute

783
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:34,759
efemer we need to use QAM ear and based

784
00:48:32,899 --> 00:48:39,199
on that we get the information on its

785
00:48:34,759 --> 00:48:42,699
evolution and how how is this but

786
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:46,039
together we want active malware samples

787
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:48,619
we want interaction with intelligence

788
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:51,499
services and we need to take that to

789
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:53,749
reverse engineering this is the

790
00:48:51,499 --> 00:48:57,198
architecture will work in and you see a

791
00:48:53,749 --> 00:48:59,209
module or an interception which receives

792
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:03,169
the connection first place in that

793
00:48:59,209 --> 00:49:07,129
module is based on a honeypot called

794
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:09,169
honey drop which is more dynamic hunter

795
00:49:07,129 --> 00:49:11,179
up specifies pros depending on the type

796
00:49:09,169 --> 00:49:14,959
of traffic and its size to which honey

797
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:19,980
but it's scented so this will allow us

798
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:23,940
to take an analysis services

799
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:28,070
and based on that decide we will decide

800
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:31,349
to which honey percent then we have

801
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:35,820
evidence more eg monitoring the big part

802
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:37,680
of the research takes place here we need

803
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:40,740
to process intelligence information

804
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,868
using different services correlating

805
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,078
data between the services and providing

806
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:47,730
real-time answer this is the hardcore

807
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,750
investigation that's all thank you very

808
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:54,920
much

809
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:54,920
