[Music]

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:17,619
bueno yo swelligant are a bokken I'm I'm

3
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:24,329
going to speak about a research at

4
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:27,810
University of dry water with jorge

5
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:31,140
garcia de Kiros

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,399
was finishing his university studies

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,399
[Music]

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:42,180
our work is to protect protocol modeling

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,969
instruction of hidden services

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:52,289
characteristics this is me and this is

11
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:55,260
Jorge I would like to thank from this

12
00:00:52,289 --> 00:01:00,469
common the Montserrat realities for

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:05,850
providing us with machines in order to

14
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:09,270
carry out this research work I'm going

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:13,038
to explain what door is have you ever

16
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:19,798
used tour or do you know what tour is

17
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:22,399
great I like that the first contribution

18
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:28,860
of a work is modeling the toe network

19
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:30,659
here you see the UML diagrams I know

20
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,709
that many of you are not software

21
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,619
engineering engineers so I won't get

22
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:40,410
into detail however the slides will be

23
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:44,220
in the internet and the extents work

24
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,270
we've done is uploaded it so you can

25
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,160
check it if you want

26
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,738
the second contribution of our work is

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,340
carrying out some work for T

28
00:01:52,739 --> 00:02:00,390
anonymization tor hidden services we

29
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:05,759
call this toward HSS scanner playing

30
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:07,830
with things as r2 does then I'll speak

31
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,860
about related work and my conditions

32
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,959
first of all what store it's a network

33
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,319
which has been specifically designed to

34
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,400
him

35
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:21,670
the users anonymity and privacy while

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,040
navigating the internet it was initially

37
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:27,929
developed by use naval research

38
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:32,700
laboratory with the aim at protecting

39
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:39,340
government networks in the u.s. today

40
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:41,920
this network allows us to allows

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,500
journalists to communicate journalists

42
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,849
who are activists who are in dangerous

43
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,849
areas in an anonymous way it allows the

44
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:54,099
state for example to carry out

45
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:57,988
undercover operations or surveillance

46
00:02:54,099 --> 00:03:02,310
operations and of course or the type of

47
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:05,859
strategical military operation currently

48
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:10,870
Tor network is my intent by an NGO in

49
00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:14,549
the US so you donate to the there's no

50
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:17,230
NGO here you don't get tax reductions

51
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:20,109
it's called the Tor project they do

52
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,260
three things first of all they develop a

53
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:25,900
specific browser which is a modification

54
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:29,260
of Mozilla Firefox those of you who use

55
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:33,150
tor did you do it ten years ago or now

56
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,149
because now it's completely different

57
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,819
now it also manages the protocols of Tor

58
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:46,989
network and it controls network status

59
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:49,720
this organization is trying to avoid the

60
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:55,090
fact that what the Tor network is many

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:58,510
nodes and they try to see and they make

62
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:01,980
sure that these nodes are not linked to

63
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:07,510
specific States which could be dangerous

64
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:09,910
how does it work tor network is going to

65
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,780
provide us with the excommunication

66
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:18,100
system based on virtual circles with no

67
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:22,240
latency and anonymous the intermediate

68
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,220
hope is going to take place through a

69
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,810
node I'm going to create a virtual

70
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,310
circuit with the different nodes of this

71
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:34,479
network what did this guarantee we'll

72
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:36,700
basically it guarantees that there's no

73
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,729
direct relation between the client and

74
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:43,539
the server so that ensures that that

75
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,140
guarantees that connections are

76
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:46,690
anonymous

77
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,750
each node only knows about the next one

78
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,710
and the previous one

79
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,330
that's a privacy of the communication

80
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:57,590
something else was also important all

81
00:04:54,330 --> 00:05:01,229
the traffic in through tor network is

82
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,890
encrypted and encrypted lands that's why

83
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:07,220
it's called Onion Routing because we you

84
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,900
have many many layers like an onion

85
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:14,220
that's imagine to have note one that

86
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:17,609
wants to communicate with note 4 I have

87
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,740
this know a bunch of nodes node 1 will

88
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:22,590
create a communication channel with node

89
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:28,760
to this node 2 will create a

90
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:31,320
communication channel with node 3 and

91
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:35,010
finally this other channel will be

92
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:40,050
created each of this less means that

93
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:43,140
it's encrypted and why do we need tor

94
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,440
that would be a good question some

95
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,770
people can use it for example for weird

96
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:54,060
failures porn with dwarves

97
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:57,690
porn with animals any weird thing you

98
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,250
may think of the use of Tor network has

99
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,530
a legitimate purpose which is

100
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,690
guaranteeing the freedom and the

101
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:08,299
individual individual rights and

102
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,300
freedoms of individuals

103
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,379
in other words access to sensitive

104
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:18,319
material in specific countries if we

105
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:21,680
were in China for example they have

106
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:25,490
firewall in the internet called the red

107
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,590
firewall which filters any type of

108
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,879
communication that goes outwards

109
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:35,919
what are they filtered if we were in

110
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:38,870
China and you google Tiananmen incident

111
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,909
you wouldn't find anything it doesn't

112
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:44,089
mean that there are no results in Google

113
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:47,360
basically China's filtering the results

114
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:49,939
to remove them see if you live in that

115
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,169
type of Kunduz this type of countries

116
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:54,349
and you want to access this type of

117
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:58,159
materials they should do it through tor

118
00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:00,979
it's also useful for victims of sexual

119
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:04,819
abuses or rapes there's some sort of

120
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:07,068
psychological support there fara chat

121
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:12,969
rooms in which this type of victims can

122
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:12,969
express their fears are their feelings

123
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,229
with people that have suffered same

124
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:23,270
experience there is some sort of support

125
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:26,120
group and of course two for

126
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,990
whistleblowing anonymously anonymous

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,580
with whistle blowing against states or

128
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,099
companies

129
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,479
but unfortunately they're illegitimate

130
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:47,490
uses this is one of the things by which

131
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:49,710
tor is known for this is an image from a

132
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,800
forum called Silk Road it was basically

133
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:58,620
an online drug market you could buy any

134
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:02,129
drug it was 24/7 dealer this service was

135
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:09,030
launched in 2011 it was closed two years

136
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:14,780
later by the FBI its founder red pirate

137
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:19,039
Robert is in jail in the US

138
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:23,059
double life sentence plus 40 years in

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:28,430
case he escapes without possibility of

140
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:35,360
parole so you can have an idea of the

141
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:37,969
business this forum had today tor is

142
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,710
used not just for this type of

143
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,530
activities but any type of illegal

144
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:47,680
activity you may think of selling

145
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:52,939
weapons child porn hiring mercenaries

146
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:57,620
guns for hire I wanted to show this

147
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:02,150
picture with the iceberg I would like to

148
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,760
speak about hidden services what I in

149
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,430
service it's cool but you can only

150
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,170
access Google through tor network that's

151
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:13,089
a hidden service it's a web server which

152
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,089
you can only access through tor

153
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,819
it has offered me double blind I don't

154
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,880
know what the web server is located I

155
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,980
don't know it's not like a regular

156
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,180
server you have the APU gives her to

157
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,890
China Korea Germany whatever I can't

158
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,260
know where the server is located and I

159
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,960
can't know who's accessing in the server

160
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:39,590
because it goes through that's the

161
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,620
advantage of hidden services hidden

162
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:49,030
services any address you find in the

163
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:51,670
internet that and in dot onion the I n a

164
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:57,140
facially recognized this Dominion in

165
00:09:51,670 --> 00:10:01,189
2015 currently if you visit this website

166
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,520
metrics to a project they have the daily

167
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:08,240
statistics of use of Tor network

168
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:11,660
currently it is made of six thousand

169
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,110
five hundred nodes so far there are two

170
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:17,060
million unique users and an average

171
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:21,410
there are a hundred and fifteen thousand

172
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:24,079
hidden services in other words services

173
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,380
we don't know what they are this iceberg

174
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:30,230
is here to show what's the visible

175
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:34,340
network which is most people know that

176
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:36,650
the Deep Web which is the web which is

177
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:40,850
not indexed by search engines and then

178
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:43,319
the dark web which

179
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:49,950
services which you can only access

180
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:51,080
through tour I've taken this image from

181
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:55,940
the internet

182
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:59,610
it's from 2015 and it shows the average

183
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,780
users per day per country there are many

184
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,910
people in the u.s. in Germany France

185
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:11,490
there are some research papers that have

186
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:13,079
analyzed the content of here in service

187
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,770
of a little bit more of detail just

188
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:19,650
using email accounts and constantly the

189
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:22,560
this bigger countries are the addresses

190
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:26,370
that you tend to use them and also

191
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:31,050
universities the top 10 users the United

192
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:34,650
States Germany Saudi Arabia

193
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:39,439
sorry United Arab Emirates Russia France

194
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:45,329
Ukraine etc well let's speak about

195
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:50,240
modeling to keep track of time document

196
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,240
on day trabajos first of all

197
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:59,199
we should know that there are many

198
00:11:53,649 --> 00:12:06,730
research studies and papers that have

199
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:14,269
studied toward protocol so these are

200
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:16,639
academia academic papers however I said

201
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:19,639
to myself well we'll have to network we

202
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,829
more or less know how it works but when

203
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:28,129
you read these specs you'll find a

204
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:31,489
problem which is that you are facing

205
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:35,540
like 20 text file that are saying all

206
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:39,589
the school format with no brief graphics

207
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:43,059
with no images no nothing and it has an

208
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:46,689
average of 18,000 texts 90 per fire

209
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:52,850
imagine that you have 20 of those files

210
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:56,540
each of those files about different

211
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:59,420
sections parts of the tor network but

212
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,639
when I say top protocol I am talking

213
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:06,050
about all the underlying two protocols

214
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:09,980
all the parts of tours I used to

215
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:13,910
communicate themselves to set up hidden

216
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:17,029
service they all come with different

217
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:20,089
protocol but we bring them all together

218
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:24,670
and adentro told protocol denomination

219
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:24,670
so imagine how difficult is it to

220
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:34,650
go through all the staff files so this

221
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:36,569
is just don't in task so this is what

222
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:43,800
motivated about work

223
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:46,800
I come from the semi-formal side of

224
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:50,459
software engineering and as I say there

225
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,890
was no other work in this regard so

226
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:56,550
therefore our contribution was modeling

227
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:58,439
the tool protocol through UML and then

228
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:02,339
to make our say when I studied that at

229
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:06,180
university and it was fully useless so

230
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:10,920
who continues to think that well if you

231
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:12,989
think that you've been visited tour is

232
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,969
useful because at the end of the day

233
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:20,010
this is a language that we afters

234
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:23,310
engineers speak so if you got together

235
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:27,210
with a Chinese always a Russian no

236
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:30,209
matter what did you speak Chinese or not

237
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:35,690
at the end of the day we will understand

238
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:43,020
each other through UML and our objective

239
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:46,620
was also using the UML graph in order to

240
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,980
use to see what are the models require

241
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:53,460
any further design further

242
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:56,450
implementation so we are still at the

243
00:14:53,460 --> 00:15:00,990
modeling phase which is the fastest step

244
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:02,960
to do these model verification this I'm

245
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,600
telling you about model-based

246
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,300
verification that has been used before

247
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,640
and actually I just did through mud

248
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:15,640
mousse protocol and others have used it

249
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:18,640
through EMV cards

250
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,439
therefore this is nothing new if I get a

251
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,540
protocol and then I do for my

252
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,920
verification surely I will find the

253
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,870
design flaws which is good what else do

254
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,560
we have in the Tor network

255
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:35,620
first of all types of notes the first

256
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:40,410
one is onion proxy that would stand for

257
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:44,470
the client you at home you launch the

258
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:46,120
browser and then you become a proxy then

259
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:51,010
we'll have the main element of Tor

260
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:55,200
network by default port 1950 and these

261
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:57,610
nodes are maintained by volunteers

262
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,870
depending on where you are in that

263
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:04,480
virtual circuit there are three types of

264
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:08,200
nodes first of all the guard node which

265
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,710
is the entry node tor network then we'll

266
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:17,260
have the exit node the node reduce to go

267
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:21,970
to ordinary web and then the middle node

268
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:26,020
in between two other ones then we other

269
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:28,620
have hidden service node that is to say

270
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,480
services unavailable through tor network

271
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:35,530
notice that onion routers will be

272
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,520
divided in others so this is class

273
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,520
diagram

274
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:45,860
and we also have directory notes

275
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,590
directly notes allow me to obtain

276
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,350
information about the current status of

277
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:55,460
the network then we also have our 30

278
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:58,840
notes whether only few are thoroughly

279
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:03,910
notes and only 10 of them and they are

280
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:09,079
selected by the organization and

281
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:12,050
authority not maintain the status of the

282
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,688
network directory notes obtain

283
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:18,349
information and then every knows which

284
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:22,339
browses their information and with

285
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:24,579
maintain status of the network then

286
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,980
introduction point and behind the rule

287
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,440
points so these are a special type of

288
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,800
notes especially when we are talking

289
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:38,420
about hidden service they are aimed at

290
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:44,540
allowing clients to connect to hidden

291
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:46,850
service then we have hidden nodes hidden

292
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:50,350
answer a special set of notes let us say

293
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:54,139
that they are kind of a guard notes but

294
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:57,830
unlisted so the notes that you used to

295
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:02,720
go to tor network are public and they

296
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:05,030
are published in the list so if I stayed

297
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,640
first in China and I want my users not

298
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,710
to go into tor network but do I just get

299
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,310
hold of the list and I block of those

300
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,590
notes because there are colleagues

301
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,440
Brij notes and notes that allowed me to

302
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:20,530
go to tour network but they are not

303
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:24,640
listed they are not public so therefore

304
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:29,050
they facilitate connection to tour

305
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:34,420
network what else

306
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:37,629
HS directory so these are notes that

307
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:45,130
keep the list of hidden services that

308
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:48,160
are available at to network these are

309
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:50,710
the notes that the client would ask for

310
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,560
permission to connect to a hidden

311
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:57,190
service our type of messages that we

312
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:00,370
find in Tor network first we have the

313
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:03,790
control cell that is to say messages

314
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:08,129
allowing me to go into communication

315
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:10,899
circuit so here we have this type of

316
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:16,080
messages create create destroy your

317
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:16,080
pardon and then we have relay sale

318
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,799
keeping the communication flow

319
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,169
communication flow goes through a to

320
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:26,720
circuits and then the tow circuit may

321
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:37,299
have more than more communication

322
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:37,299
circuits simultaneously so we start here

323
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,799
so far so good eating it

324
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:51,379
so these I will have here is a client

325
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:56,600
who wants to connect to tor network so

326
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:59,060
this is a set of steps that are followed

327
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:02,120
to establish the virtual circuit of

328
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:05,389
communication we see one of the nodes

329
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:09,260
being connected this is the encrypted

330
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:11,870
layer so this is a connection asking to

331
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:16,820
extend the circuit this is the message

332
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:19,639
extend the circuits to a another node so

333
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,830
information is encrypted with the key of

334
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,810
the first node and also with a key of

335
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,550
the second node then the second node

336
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:28,899
receive this information say okay I'm

337
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:32,000
already connected and then again

338
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,370
connection we created with a third node

339
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,320
well how many not so you need to create

340
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:40,340
a circuit you need a minimum of three

341
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,159
nodes on the left and three nodes on the

342
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:47,110
right so that is to say minimum of six

343
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:51,340
nodes to go from one hand to the other

344
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:54,919
so regarding internal communications

345
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,100
will be here this is a message that is

346
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,430
being set and then external

347
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,770
communication show on the right so here

348
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:06,170
we have very many notes we have created

349
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:08,060
segments with very many nodes and at the

350
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:14,890
end of the day we are exiting to the

351
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:14,889
internet but to any website

352
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:29,620
so here it tells me that this connection

353
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:33,939
is not encrypted the mind that this is a

354
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:37,510
node the exit node all the information

355
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:46,960
here is TLS encrypted because it comes

356
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:50,879
through tor network so this is well I

357
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:57,670
have a better flow diagram that this one

358
00:21:50,880 --> 00:22:01,030
that I shall later done these hidden

359
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:04,750
service announcement for that a circuit

360
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:08,080
is created asking it to select the

361
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,960
number of nodes and then sever of

362
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:15,840
hearing services received information

363
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,840
about all the entry notes

364
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:25,159
this is a bit more complicated and it's

365
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:27,860
a bit difficult to read it's more

366
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:31,610
complex ok so what type of behaviors are

367
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:37,879
we find in these notes by default all

368
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:40,669
nodes in Tor network follow all these

369
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,100
behaviors updates the network through

370
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:46,820
consensus it also updates descriptors

371
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:49,340
and it also controls the circuits so

372
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,070
that means when it gets the message

373
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:55,399
we're extending a circuit study circuit

374
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,800
etc and end user actions all of these

375
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:01,010
actions have been modeled here on the

376
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:05,450
right I'm not going to go into them but

377
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:09,830
if you are curious in knowing how often

378
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,460
our descriptors updated when every 10

379
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:18,470
minutes

380
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:20,450
they are often updated now note

381
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:24,470
behaviors

382
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,330
it snowed or sub node will have

383
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:30,100
different behaviors depending on the

384
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,100
type of error in them

385
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:41,330
ordinary onion routers will just send

386
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:44,120
messages and that will be it and then of

387
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:49,850
course locating descriptor authorization

388
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:54,159
notes will perform more tasks as same as

389
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:57,740
directory notes so these tasks are

390
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:01,580
related to each other so we have the

391
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,470
directory know informing about the

392
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,590
status of the network and then the

393
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:13,750
authority knows maintaining the status

394
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:16,320
of the network so now the anonymization

395
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:19,900
[Music]

396
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:24,149
here we decide we designed an automatic

397
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:28,840
system to access to to hidden services

398
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:35,040
to retrieve information and to the

399
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:41,709
anonymize them we have recovered some

400
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:50,050
1800 hidden services and dresses and now

401
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:52,180
our of these collected addresses we have

402
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:59,590
succeeded in binding these hidden

403
00:24:52,180 --> 00:25:04,060
services to 346 devices available in the

404
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:07,449
visible internet system we managed to do

405
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:10,179
that thanks to similar characteristics

406
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:14,050
in them so that does not mean that we

407
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:16,180
have discovered 346 hidden services we

408
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:18,790
just said that we found services

409
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:21,670
available in ordinary network that share

410
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:29,389
characteristics with other services that

411
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:31,720
are delivered provided in the Deep Web

412
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:35,740
[Music]

413
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:38,649
and because we have a sec access to each

414
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:42,759
and every one of those services we

415
00:25:38,649 --> 00:25:48,489
decided to classify the content of these

416
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:57,789
services so our analysis was based on

417
00:25:48,490 --> 00:26:00,000
word count and we've seen what came out

418
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:03,360
with graphs talking about cryptocurrency

419
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,110
drugs and pornography

420
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:14,979
so pornography included everything child

421
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:18,189
porn on top of porn so now a fickle

422
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,799
considerations well the system that we

423
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,929
have designed is automatic all the

424
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,960
information was retrieved in an

425
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:29,129
automatic manner and then it was stored

426
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,919
in a database we primarily have

427
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:34,870
collected text we just connected our

428
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:38,440
service to the hidden service we got the

429
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:41,610
HTML of the main website and we just

430
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:46,059
retrieved text we did not collect any

431
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:48,729
images we just didn't see anything we

432
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:52,470
just didn't do anything that could be

433
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,470
considered to be a crime

434
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:58,799
[Music]

435
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,529
well I said before terrible it's keepin

436
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:08,429
it slide and I did it on purpose because

437
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:16,860
I wanted to show these diagram because

438
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:19,259
this one is self-explanatory someone the

439
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,870
left will have a juicer and on the right

440
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:23,940
we have a student service

441
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:29,428
and in between we have a number of

442
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:33,179
routers each of these brother have

443
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:34,950
representing nodes in the network and

444
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,379
they all play a different role the first

445
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:40,799
one is for hidden services and directory

446
00:27:37,379 --> 00:27:46,850
the second one is an IP node and the

447
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,850
last one is our P node for interval

448
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:58,159
[Music]

449
00:27:54,950 --> 00:28:00,440
what about what that's a connection to

450
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,840
hidden service work what the hidden

451
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:10,370
service will choose a number of random

452
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:13,129
nodes in the hidden network and will

453
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:15,500
name them as IP nodes and that's the

454
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:18,470
first step okay you feel chosen you will

455
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:23,390
be my IP node one Supino's have been

456
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:26,030
collected there will be sent out to this

457
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:28,550
directory of hidden services for said

458
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:31,280
look this is me I am this hidden service

459
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:35,500
if someone asks you about me these are

460
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:41,720
my IP nodes so far so good

461
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:45,010
say yes now the user wants to visit the

462
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,900
porn site and then goes to his onion

463
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:52,250
site I don't know what that you've seen

464
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:55,580
and onion address it's offering a very

465
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:57,290
long extra decimal address I don't know

466
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:01,699
how many characters are very needful

467
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:05,120
there are saying 6484 both letters and

468
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:08,810
numbers then the onion addresses and

469
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:13,959
that and then requests will be

470
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:13,960
redirected to an HS directories

471
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,680
[Music]

472
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:23,540
saying which ones are the IP notes and

473
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,940
then it goes and say look I want to

474
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,430
connect to these hidden service and then

475
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:31,700
on top of that I want to be here and

476
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:36,480
that would be the RP node so the client

477
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,740
chooses the set of notes set of RP note

478
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,830
[Music]

479
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:46,520
well he wants to meet the hidden service

480
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:49,070
once the HS dear cells in about the IP

481
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,340
note communicates this information to

482
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,840
thee

483
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,060
I've been out and the upper node

484
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,199
communicates that to hidden service and

485
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,330
what happens next

486
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,020
the hidden service establishes a circuit

487
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:02,120
with the RP node and from there

488
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:05,330
communication takes place between the

489
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:09,439
hidden service and de souza each of

490
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:12,040
these errors have rows stand for a toe

491
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,780
separate this is not direct

492
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:20,290
communication this is a virtual service

493
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:20,290
that takes place through the network

[Music]

495
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,480
so this is a flow chart that we have

496
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:32,730
designed we have a machine there which

497
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,350
is the onion proxy which is being

498
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:42,650
connected to tor network and which is

499
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:46,049
collecting addresses please as I say

500
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:48,750
connecting each and every one of the

501
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:51,320
main services main sites of these

502
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:56,640
services basically this is a crawler

503
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:58,710
designing see it is there we feed it

504
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,179
with onion addresses goes to unalloyed

505
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:07,730
resist tries to establish an HTTP and

506
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:11,480
HTTPS connection and if it is successful

507
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:14,970
information is stored in the database so

508
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,880
this is the collection of hidden

509
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:23,530
services addresses the second part is D

510
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:26,320
and no anonymous aim

511
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:29,830
all the characteristics and information

512
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,980
that we go through HTTP and HTTPS that

513
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:42,010
is to say all the headers all the meta

514
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:46,560
data that was generated is stored so in

515
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:52,620
case of HTTPS fingerprint as a cell

516
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:57,629
types of the certificates etc all that

517
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:59,679
information has been checked against the

518
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:04,330
information available assured and

519
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:05,020
database are you aware of sudden when

520
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:09,120
Sheldon

521
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:11,889
Shannon is like make a computer which is

522
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:21,219
listening out everything that takes

523
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:24,010
place in the Internet to consult that

524
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:29,010
information we have designed an

525
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:29,010
algorithm aimed at finding similarities

526
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:41,750
after the Animas asian we moved onto

527
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:43,710
categorization that main site HTML with

528
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:48,220
each

529
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:50,920
every the services have been classified

530
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,740
in three categories

531
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,590
oh sorry full categories drug sexual

532
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:59,080
content cryptocurrencies and terrorism

533
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:01,990
and we have defined a number of key

534
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:08,919
terms for each category so in case of

535
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:14,800
drugs unless the weed speed for

536
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:18,190
terrorism jihad explosive dynamics for

537
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,770
each of those HTML we try to see whether

538
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:23,950
we could fit them into this specific

539
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,780
category what we did here was just word

540
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:28,180
count

541
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:31,620
so this is kind of bit ugly we could

542
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:35,500
have we could have fine-tuned it a bit

543
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:37,209
but that's the way we did it so imagine

544
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,200
that I have a hidden service from the

545
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:45,160
internet with very many links to Bitcoin

546
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,900
sites imagine that I don't take care of

547
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,520
that what happens there at the end of

548
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,430
the day I will have lots of bitcoins

549
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:54,370
bitcoins that does not mean that I'm

550
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:58,840
dealing with bitcoins however the system

551
00:33:54,370 --> 00:34:01,629
will classify it as Bitcoin so regarding

552
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:06,029
natural language processing we have used

553
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:12,730
an entire K as well as pi

554
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:14,889
experimental results so the system to

555
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:22,119
collect other mattresses who have

556
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:27,609
captured or collected 17 328,000

557
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:30,550
addresses so we only successfully

558
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:34,989
connected through HTTP and HTTPS

559
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:40,899
connections to 1796 addresses the

560
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:43,299
timeout set was of 30 seconds what

561
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:45,489
happens here you can configure hidden

562
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:49,210
services in different ways you can use

563
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:51,549
an ordinary Apache or an Apache which is

564
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:57,520
limited and restricted to some users

565
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:59,230
only offering sense through access can

566
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,520
only be came through and the encrypted

567
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:05,740
key specific certificate and if that

568
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,330
were to be the case we could not connect

569
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,118
through these hidden services either

570
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:13,240
another comment that you may find is

571
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:16,960
that hidden services often changed their

572
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,089
domain something that we didn't do and

573
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,470
other researchers have done and probably

574
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:27,160
will be what we will be would do next is

575
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:31,618
to do screenshots of that home screen

576
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:34,839
and then to check different domain names

577
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:37,930
with the same content because many

578
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:42,630
hidden services have illegal content in

579
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,629
them they often change their domains

580
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:58,620
so the results are the following 30% of

581
00:35:51,320 --> 00:36:05,340
those bounded to 10 devices so we have

582
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:09,509
19.3 here of devices according to one

583
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:12,390
device that does not mean that that

584
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:16,710
server is actually providing the hidden

585
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:19,319
service well perhaps we just called the

586
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:25,220
server of the language and the time

587
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:28,650
stamp and many Internet services contain

588
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:33,509
that very same information however we

589
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:35,720
have also had some successful cases so

590
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:41,430
regarding classification of content

591
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:45,540
these are the results this is a list of

592
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:49,319
site category cryptocurrency drugs

593
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:52,620
sexual content and the lowest one being

594
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:56,970
terrorism because in the languages but

595
00:36:52,620 --> 00:37:00,540
we had indexes so we also try to make a

596
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:04,500
list of hidden services the problem is

597
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:06,660
that only 55 supported by nltk

598
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,510
and we have detected 28 different

599
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:15,390
languages the most common one being

600
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:17,960
English Spanish is well there appears

601
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,279
only in 25 hidden services

602
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:25,280
[Music]

603
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:28,320
success cases an example the

604
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,570
anonymization on the Left we have the

605
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,810
ordinary service that you find on the

606
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:38,280
Internet through a server and on the

607
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:42,660
rice hidden service notice from the very

608
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,940
same company so they are kind of not

609
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,940
hiding themselves very much but this is

610
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:51,750
a result that we got from our in our

611
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:55,070
research check their house and actually

612
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,070
is the same company

613
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:06,510
probably this is so because perhaps they

614
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:10,800
have the same server providing services

615
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:12,810
what the internet and also to the Tor

616
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:19,050
network well I'm sure you are all aware

617
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:24,960
of this Pirate Bay so we have the hidden

618
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:29,850
service here and the ordinary service so

619
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:33,590
we have just hidden all the information

620
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,589
okay we have the rest of the information

621
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:48,960
perhaps you are wondering now how can

622
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:55,080
you find hidden services in the visible

623
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,820
web well we should pay in mind that

624
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:00,210
sometimes administrators of hidden

625
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:11,550
services are just ordinary people our to

626
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:13,890
ordinary people to PHP MySQL Apache such

627
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:16,980
a junior configure the system well to

628
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:22,560
prevent possible potential infiltration

629
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:26,160
of data or data leakage so many people

630
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,140
try to launch the analyzation attacks

631
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,649
through direct participation in the

632
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:35,400
virtual circuits of communication so we

633
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:39,290
didn't do such a direct attack so we are

634
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:46,580
not part of their virtual circuits and

635
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:46,580
many people also into network

636
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:53,140
analyze what's possible to launch

637
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:56,109
fingerprinting attacks based on website

638
00:39:53,140 --> 00:40:04,739
traffic many researchers are working on

639
00:39:56,109 --> 00:40:04,739
that so this is an article from 2016

640
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:11,950
where comprehensive classification of

641
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:14,999
hidden services so that work is being

642
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,269
offered so this article was published in

643
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:20,589
2016

644
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:27,729
however data were gathered in 2014 at

645
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:31,210
that time turtle version was on so we

646
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:35,559
turned to version analyzing hidden

647
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:39,690
services was much simpler to developers

648
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:40,930
realized that and then they not turn 3

649
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,000
fashion

650
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:48,020
[Music]

651
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,599
during hidden service II not keep an

652
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:55,250
awning address as they used to do that

653
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:57,800
but they keep a key public public key of

654
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:00,320
the hidden address so therefore there is

655
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,290
no way to know which is the address

656
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:05,630
behind that public key well in version

657
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:09,410
number two everything was much easier

658
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:16,550
however we came in three or four years

659
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:19,250
late at this point in time for directory

660
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:22,340
node of hidden services you'll have to

661
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:26,000
be a node and you have to run to three

662
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:28,540
version so you cannot work with torture

663
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,540
anymore

664
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:43,250
Danita share this information with you

665
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:46,089
we also have a very an interesting

666
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,090
website

667
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,900
we're 6556

668
00:41:50,460 --> 00:42:03,420
addresses well collected and they were

669
00:41:53,900 --> 00:42:08,849
connected to 1174 other addresses well

670
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:13,829
to conclude remember we have worked on

671
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:18,750
two aspects on the one hand we analyzed

672
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:20,700
a two protocol and we modern it so that

673
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,640
we could better understand how to work

674
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,910
without having to read those twenty text

675
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,680
files I also told you about the elements

676
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,509
of the network that some of nodes the

677
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,848
type of messages how this communication

678
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:35,099
is established the behavior of his notes

679
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:39,510
and remember that first and foremost

680
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:43,410
objective was just to perform a

681
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:45,420
model-based verification what are we

682
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,520
planning to do in the future the next

683
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,910
step should be to continue working along

684
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:56,250
those lines and not only that we would

685
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:59,399
like to get these same informal models

686
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:04,040
UML diagrams and to transform them into

687
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:06,869
formal models where we could implement

688
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,119
mathematical algorithms with the

689
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:12,809
ultimate goal of evaluating their

690
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:16,349
behaviors so here we've thinking about

691
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:19,230
transforming all UML diagram models into

692
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:21,750
Petri nets to have a framework of

693
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:24,809
analysis regarding the tool that we have

694
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:26,309
developed it is Samed are collecting our

695
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:30,829
new addresses connecting to them

696
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:32,990
collecting data HTTP and HTTPS to

697
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:37,510
anonymize them

698
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:42,609
we have also established connections to

699
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:46,220
1196 health services addresses and we

700
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:52,700
planted that to less than ten Internet

701
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:58,189
systems so future improvement several of

702
00:43:52,700 --> 00:44:02,618
them we can improve the way in which we

703
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:05,690
have collected all these onion addresses

704
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:08,060
also and also one of the top problems

705
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:11,180
that we find is the subsisting of the

706
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,400
atomization thing is that we are between

707
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:16,460
using shutter have introduced shuttin

708
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:20,540
ever well if you think that the Sheldon

709
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:23,359
database is updated it is not updated so

710
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,670
we kind of have like an academic fashion

711
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,759
which I take it is the same as the pay

712
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:31,400
fashion but there are other type of

713
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:35,300
services up there such as sensors and

714
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:38,390
others that do exactly the same thing as

715
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:41,980
shuttle however the internet databases

716
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:45,170
are more updated so therefore our

717
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:47,420
primary objective should be just to

718
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,580
change that the atomization to carry

719
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:53,470
that out through systems other than

720
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:57,140
shuttle and then better categorization

721
00:44:53,470 --> 00:45:01,160
our categorization is very simple it's

722
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:05,480
based on words we just get HTML we do a

723
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:08,890
well count we categorizes and here we

724
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:12,220
are going into Semantic Web

725
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:14,950
it could be implemented to check whether

726
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:18,730
the website is talking about one thing

727
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:21,910
or another and then of course extending

728
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:24,580
the range of category and this is all

729
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:28,060
for me thank you very much I hope it's

730
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:30,490
been entertaining so you have any

731
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:33,600
questions I will be around very happy to

732
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,600
answer thank you

733
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:46,410
creo que tenemos tiempo para brundun I

734
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:47,270
think we have time for questions don't

735
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:59,940
be shy

736
00:45:47,270 --> 00:46:02,610
no see I want the last evaluate I'll go

737
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:06,720
home the question is what they were

738
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:13,080
going to free the goat what's exactly um

739
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:17,029
L this is a joke right now I have it

740
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:19,790
understood what you mean by UML UML

741
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:23,870
what's your man that's your question

742
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:26,670
it's unified modeling language it's the

743
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:28,589
standard semi standard use in the

744
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:34,500
industry in order to model software

745
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:38,870
systems thank you perhaps I should have

746
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:43,430
included a slide with basic concepts

747
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:43,430
other question here and then at the back

748
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,529
if you study computing signs you'll

749
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:58,680
suffer because in study Yemen have you

750
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:01,920
ever thought of using some sort of fussy

751
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:05,100
hashing for comparing the websites just

752
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,130
by using text and seeing how close they

753
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,130
are

754
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:15,870
no we haven't thought about that but we

755
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,600
work with fuzzy hashing in memory

756
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:20,970
forensic we could try to apply it

757
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,670
because it's basically designed to run

758
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:26,399
text analysis or similarities between

759
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,360
texts but no we haven't thought it it

760
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,400
could be interesting

761
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:34,710
yes but I'm a bit scared about the

762
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,110
results because considering how it

763
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:40,440
behaves in foreign memory foreign sick

764
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:45,180
I'm not sure if it's going to be okay

765
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:48,600
but thank you I I'll give the idea my

766
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:53,759
question is related to nose candy acts

767
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:57,930
the nodes in an invisible way that they

768
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:01,430
cannot be tracked they are invisible as

769
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:01,430
if they didn't exist

770
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:10,319
so I note that no one knows it's there

771
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:13,319
no because any node in the Tor network

772
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:16,739
has a descriptor which is published that

773
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:18,089
the others know what it is and so that

774
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:18,949
they can establish the communication

775
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:23,939
through it

776
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:27,630
so having invisible notes except for

777
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:34,319
bridge nodes which could be invisible so

778
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:37,979
that they can't be censored any type of

779
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:41,038
social media to establish communication

780
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:44,279
for example the Deep Web if you want to

781
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:51,839
look search for something a social media

782
00:48:44,279 --> 00:48:53,759
for what for example if you want to find

783
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:59,399
information about the state about

784
00:48:53,759 --> 00:49:02,850
something obviously the internet some

785
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:06,029
apps and I'm not sure about that

786
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:08,220
I'm not I don't know anything about

787
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:11,280
social media for that but tried to use a

788
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:14,480
server different than Google in order to

789
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,480
find different results

790
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:26,500
they're an email service ah but that's

791
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:32,920
was that's an email provider is it safe

792
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:36,940
I'm not familiar with it if I if I

793
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,329
access that I could they could get my

794
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:40,569
data

795
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:43,380
well his protonmail which is known by

796
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:43,380
the industry

797
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:54,519
the eyepiece of nodes of Tor network

798
00:49:51,309 --> 00:49:58,690
nodes are public only discover when you

799
00:49:54,519 --> 00:50:05,470
discover the exit nodes IPS when you

800
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:11,109
execute you can execute tour by being a

801
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:13,899
proxy so that you can be a proxy all you

802
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:16,569
can offer your computer in order to be a

803
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:21,849
node between the Tor network will you

804
00:50:16,569 --> 00:50:23,799
configure your PC your computer to

805
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:27,249
become a node you need to choose what

806
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:33,549
type of node you are if you want to be

807
00:50:27,249 --> 00:50:35,980
an exit node you can face many requests

808
00:50:33,549 --> 00:50:40,630
abuse requests from many companies and

809
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:43,269
state agencies because all troll

810
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:46,210
connections are going to end up in your

811
00:50:43,269 --> 00:50:50,399
IP and through your IP they're going to

812
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:53,710
connect to wait things for example

813
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:59,380
tokenism artists and spam and your

814
00:50:53,710 --> 00:51:02,769
server will be classified as spam that

815
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:06,250
happened in one University because the

816
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:09,459
configuration was wrong one

817
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:13,240
therefore we could say that the dynamic

818
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:17,140
they changed a real-time the exit nose I

819
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:20,589
abyss yes if you go out to the normal

820
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:23,500
internet someone needs to put a face and

821
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:26,530
that's what the exit notes do if you

822
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:28,810
want to be part of the tour Network and

823
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:32,680
I encourage you to do it think you

824
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:35,020
should think where you want to be I was

825
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,940
thinking about defending from tor

826
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,590
network instead of being part you need

827
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:47,910
to think about in which part of the

828
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:52,020
train you want to be any other question

829
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:52,020
why do you like asking questions

830
00:51:55,219 --> 00:52:08,239
what's the difference between European

831
00:51:57,209 --> 00:52:10,799
and tour difference between VPN and tour

832
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:14,609
between these two things well it's

833
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:16,049
completely different VPN it's a virtual

834
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:18,390
private network you have a combination

835
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:19,619
channel int which everything is encrypts

836
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:24,719
but you know who is communicating with

837
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:26,670
them both ends and tor works through

838
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:29,819
virtual servers you have communications

839
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:31,499
with many nodes and he reaches this

840
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:33,390
nation Belladonna who is communicating

841
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:42,019
with whom so the model is completely

842
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:42,019
different VPN is going to be faster

843
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:51,630
I've checked toll and their plugins so

844
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:57,960
that when you enter this entry note is

845
00:52:51,630 --> 00:53:00,150
encrypted could you please repeat when

846
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,850
you enter when you access their plugins

847
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:08,520
I don't know whether they do this when

848
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:13,049
you enter then there are notes that node

849
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,700
is encrypted when you establish a

850
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:17,220
connection with the first note that the

851
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:20,310
connection is already encrypted the only

852
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:24,480
problem you have and I think they've

853
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:29,700
already solved it would last version but

854
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:34,080
please check the DNS request didn't go

855
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:35,549
through tor so if someone was in the

856
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,279
middle of a communication could know

857
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:41,910
which where the DNS request is being

858
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:43,680
carried out they could they could know

859
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:46,200
to which that arise you want to connect

860
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,270
where it couldn't see it through door

861
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,270
they're going to know that you connected

862
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:54,830
to that website but they can see what

863
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:58,170
you see I think though there was a patch

864
00:53:54,830 --> 00:54:01,860
plugging to solve it and it's already

865
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:04,280
included in the main branch any other

866
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:06,520
question

867
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:11,429
well thank you very much

868
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,429
[Applause]

869
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,210
you
