2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:19,299
bueno que tal VA no mummification NCS a

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:22,090
una docena de a Maria no quiero perder a

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,840
roll all right good morning everyone I

5
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:29,140
am a security analyst and at this point

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:35,080
in time I'm kind of changing that role

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:37,210
and why is that while I work in eleven

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,720
paths which is the cyber security unit

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:45,300
at telefónica and the president of

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:49,420
telefónica has realized that there is

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:54,250
significant important future for

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:01:00,549
blockchain and then he decided to set up

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:04,449
a group a group that has been the

14
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:10,500
voltage to blockchain since the last

15
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:10,500
year I've been focusing on the topic

16
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:20,200
from early for the last six months

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,570
so before I start my presentation I'd

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:30,280
like to say that we have found very many

19
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:32,679
well challenges in our path and I would

20
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,480
like to share that with you so it does

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,790
in case you just in case you've already

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,030
started so that you can learn from that

23
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:43,750
and as I was saying this technology has

24
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:48,250
gone through several phases a few years

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:50,290
ago what the blockchain started we could

26
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,120
see from the viewpoint of security that

27
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:59,610
there were lots of malware and

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:02:02,689
ransomware that were using bitcoins for

29
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:10,610
the ransoms

30
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:16,700
and and at that time banks thought that

31
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:19,129
they would be disintermediated that is

32
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,819
to say that will be like no central bank

33
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:25,730
kind of money gene these new payment

34
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:30,548
system through bitcoins however nowadays

35
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:33,679
we are a completely different faith

36
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:36,680
we've been realizing that some people

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,549
are already using Bitcoin but however

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:44,120
we've seen that the technology behind

39
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:48,700
that which is what blockchain so

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:52,549
everything but now blockchain is booming

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,679
every day I see in the news that the

42
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:57,709
shares of a company will increase their

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,239
values because they are using blockchain

44
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,760
because they are doing this or that or

45
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,170
they are reducing the expenses because

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,108
they are using block chains well

47
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,700
sometimes I even think we are watching

48
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:10,250
prepare me a coffee in the morning well

49
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,470
we should be very careful there because

50
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,810
these technology will not always

51
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:18,319
contribute the huge potential that it

52
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,810
has so therefore that is the purpose of

53
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,298
my presentation that is to say to find

54
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:29,239
out about the capabilities of luck chain

55
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:32,419
and to develop solutions accordingly and

56
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:34,940
as I said my background in security has

57
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:39,380
been very helpful because now I have to

58
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:42,380
create a solution as a telephonic and

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,980
the first thing that I think about is

60
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,510
who are my end users those who do not

61
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,418
have an understanding of the underlying

62
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,090
technology and therefore to which to

63
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:56,950
whom I want to give them that security

64
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:01,010
layer so I will see how to create set up

65
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:03,918
architecture from scratch using all the

66
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:07,730
expertise that I have will be able to

67
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:10,459
provide a level or layer of security to

68
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:13,890
end-users who is aware of blockchain how

69
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:17,450
any of you here has

70
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:27,210
set up or created a blockchain solution

71
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:32,580
all right so let's move on to it so we

72
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:36,599
will be talking about bitcoins as a

73
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,870
currency but all currencies are well

74
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,940
there are very many currencies and they

75
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,320
are all different when someone has to be

76
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,150
what's the difference between become

77
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,770
than any other currency and I said well

78
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,500
I don't know give me some time I will

79
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,620
have to read about them because they are

80
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,540
all different okay so this is the

81
00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:01,110
structure first parts Alice wants to

82
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,600
send out bitcoins to Bob to me Alice and

83
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,400
Bob are Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,830
the movies so well Alice and Bob are

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,590
derivatives in technology books okay

86
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:17,550
Alice wants to send bitcoins to Bob both

87
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:20,549
will have to have key or private keys

88
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:24,570
associated to them wallets so this is

89
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:30,330
the structure starting pointing private

90
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:33,290
key so if you are tech savvy so you can

91
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:37,130
really invest time in finding out how

92
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:45,500
cryptography works in Bitcoin

93
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:45,500
so from private key a curve is applied

94
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:54,890
then we get to a public key and that

95
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:59,930
public key applies a hash algorithm and

96
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:02,300
then in blue we have these bits that is

97
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:07,240
to say the address that the user will

98
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:11,510
catch before that we will have the

99
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,910
protocol version of Bitcoin and then we

100
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:18,710
will have a number of subsequent parts

101
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:22,310
that we will be checking we will that

102
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:29,270
will be validating the that that address

103
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:33,050
has been rightly for properly generated

104
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:38,799
so this is the first question user ready

105
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:42,680
to have private keys and address and

106
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,680
addresses so do I really want to give

107
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,820
that power to the user that is to say to

108
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,730
manage his private keys and addresses

109
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,750
how do you feel about that well in

110
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:59,150
traditional Bitcoin system users have

111
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:02,150
power to manage the private keys and

112
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:06,289
addresses but what about users are users

113
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:11,299
aware enough are they today no that is

114
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:14,480
the way to lose private key perhaps

115
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,360
money could be easily stolen so the

116
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:21,020
answer is no well at least this is how I

117
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:26,170
feel I'm sure that a society will evolve

118
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:31,340
people with learn how to store the keys

119
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:35,360
securely but to date I think that we are

120
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,849
not yet ready for that but when I talk

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,310
about this and we use the same examples

122
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:47,210
I started working in this world because

123
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:52,630
a colleague Felix well in 2013 he was

124
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:56,320
already mining he used to set up his

125
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,900
a PC for mining at a time where mining

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:03,460
was profitable where because nowadays

127
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:07,030
there is a specific hub for mining and

128
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:13,419
actually we tested even dare to compete

129
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:16,119
against the PC mining operations well he

130
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,280
was mining and he started to get his

131
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,490
bitcoins and they've realized a Bitcoin

132
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:24,099
hard drone and he won't work - I have my

133
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,260
keys and then he found his wallet were

134
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,500
the private keys were restored however

135
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:32,729
that was protected through a master key

136
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,380
and a master key that was so no so

137
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,380
complicated to remember that he could

138
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:43,000
not remember it he had lost his private

139
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:46,030
key he could not move his money now he's

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,510
got some three thousand euros in Bitcoin

141
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:54,839
and he kind of moved that money at all

142
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:58,270
and my colleague is not technological

143
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,460
dummy parole but that happened to him if

144
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:05,280
that happened to him imagine that could

145
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:08,800
happen to ordinary Jusuf second question

146
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:13,560
Alice trace a transaction and signs that

147
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:17,560
with his private key can we really

148
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,829
estimate the volume of parisians

149
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,920
to create instructions that is to say if

150
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:27,730
I create a solution based on Bitcoin or

151
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,719
any other currency do I really know how

152
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:34,240
many clients will use my service

153
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,420
how many transactions and operations

154
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,660
will each of my clients carry out can I

155
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:43,540
really estimate the price or the fee

156
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,390
that miners which charge me for each of

157
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:50,680
the transactions well as we should not

158
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,130
forget that Bitcoin value changes every

159
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,250
day

160
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,650
Bitcoin is highly volatile so therefore

161
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,250
it's very difficult to make this kind of

162
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:02,579
calculations and estimations today so

163
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,580
therefore

164
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:09,910
other type of anchoring information in

165
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:12,899
the Bitcoin chains are being looked into

166
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:16,569
that is to say pointing out other

167
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:19,749
distributed addresses and I will tell

168
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:21,910
you more about it later on so the answer

169
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:25,300
is again no we don't have that capacity

170
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:29,499
if we anchor that information in a chain

171
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:32,758
of public keys where we cannot do that

172
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:36,399
that's why we had had the arrival of

173
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:39,550
private keys that is to say a time where

174
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,939
network has been created and no fees are

175
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:47,290
charged for transactions so people

176
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:50,559
carried out transactions among agents

177
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:53,439
who have authorization to carry out

178
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,899
those transactions and why we were

179
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:59,259
talking about fees here well at the end

180
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:02,740
of the day miners have two ways of

181
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:06,279
making a profit well either through

182
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:09,220
coining new currencies and depending on

183
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,459
the time line where you are you will be

184
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,120
making higher or lower profit if you are

185
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:17,079
fortunate to add the block next to the

186
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,300
blockchain

187
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:24,638
that means coining a coin so in the past

188
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,620
for adding a block to where when you

189
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,480
would receive 50 coins four years later

190
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:34,870
that was cut down by 50 this is having

191
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:40,059
process that's the name given to it so

192
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:44,199
again having a having so the trend for

193
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:46,529
miners is the following the money that

194
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:52,859
they will be getting will not be through

195
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:52,860
kind coning but through the fees of

196
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:57,149
introducer transactions

197
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:08,880
at the end of the day the miner will get

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:16,319
profit from coning plus from the fees

199
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:24,060
that will be added on to that block and

200
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:27,870
why are fees increased why is there this

201
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:34,258
upward trend well this is not a classic

202
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:37,980
supply and demand graph so this block is

203
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:41,430
limited to one megabyte no information

204
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,339
because one megabyte could enter in a

205
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:47,219
block so therefore that space will

206
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:56,190
become more and more expensive the

207
00:12:47,220 --> 00:13:00,029
higher their demand the supply will grow

208
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:04,199
exponentially and this is a clear

209
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:06,389
example of that 2017 there was a

210
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:12,240
collapse were blocks were filled and

211
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:15,269
filled and fees were skyrocketed I will

212
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,149
give the following example in 11 parts

213
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:20,850
twice a year we are allowed to do a

214
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:23,160
hackathon the hackathon lasts for 24

215
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,620
hours they let us program everything

216
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,689
that we didn't program during the year

217
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,279
for whatever reason because it was not

218
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,319
considered relevant or because the

219
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,870
project manager does not allow us to do

220
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:36,300
that so as I say in the hackathon we

221
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:43,790
program as much as we want and it's ok

222
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:46,260
happy idea make what you can program it

223
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,560
happy because we were interested in this

224
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,449
system we were looking into what we

225
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,430
could contribute from security

226
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:55,979
perspective well we had already

227
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:59,130
encountered the problem versus are

228
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,110
having users losing the travel keys and

229
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,759
I said well we are a telecommunication

230
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,860
company let's take advantage of our

231
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,680
hover elements that is to say they feel

232
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,980
sim where we may store information

233
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,589
through a private key and let us say ok

234
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:15,570
let's try to do that signature

235
00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:21,410
operations for transactions within the

236
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:26,579
actual sim so we achieved the challenge

237
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:28,439
we succeeded in our hackathon but they

238
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:31,050
gave me time that we found that we had

239
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,050
no bitcoins to do that we had to buy it

240
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,870
we bought a few cents of bitcoins when

241
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,599
it came to presenting our solutions and

242
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,370
say ok well it has explained that we did

243
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,769
a transaction that we send it and then

244
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,510
aside pending confirmation pending

245
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:48,600
confirmation it took 20 minutes to

246
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,519
confirm our transaction that's one of

247
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,560
the products that we have here if we

248
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:55,470
create a solution based on the specific

249
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,410
block chain and we are anchoring that

250
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,699
information in a chain of public keys

251
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:05,040
and I'm very much of a fan of public

252
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:08,219
block chains which actually I think this

253
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,889
would actually give sense to use in this

254
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,630
technology you cannot really wait for 20

255
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:16,170
minutes I kind of really picture myself

256
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:18,329
going to decorate to buy my loaf of

257
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,760
bread and waiting for 20 minutes up

258
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:25,319
until the transaction has been complete

259
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:27,720
successfully completed so as I say this

260
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:30,449
is not feasible and when this type of

261
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:34,920
things happen that's why we have these

262
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:39,750
folks then we have miners as well as

263
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,870
project developers saying look this is

264
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:53,730
not working

265
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:58,070
let us - then let us look into features

266
00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:05,149
that happened before in corn market

267
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:11,430
Capcom we can find a list of more than

268
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:14,449
1,400 different operations people all

269
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,739
over the world invest in lots of time in

270
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:19,859
looking into what is the contribution

271
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,800
from each of these projects and the

272
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,220
first one of these folks is very

273
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,430
relevant it is important to be aware of

274
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,699
when this happen for the first time

275
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:36,750
August 2017 the first folk of Bitcoin

276
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:38,790
was created what does that mean well

277
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:42,480
that means that the rules of the game

278
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:45,449
changed so that is to say they lead to

279
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,370
solutions based on prior solutions using

280
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:49,920
a similar protocol to that of Bitcoin

281
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,019
however new rules were established rules

282
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,899
that were not compatible with the

283
00:16:52,019 --> 00:17:00,990
original rules that is to say so this is

284
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:06,209
the ordinary Bitcoin chain but then I

285
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:08,699
buy Bitcoin cash here in green but I

286
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,000
cannot I spend my VidCon cash in the

287
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,520
Bitcoin net

288
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,579
however if I had bitcoins here on top I

289
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,809
can spend them on both in the Bitcoin

290
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:24,698
chain and as well as in Bitcoin cash an

291
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:29,960
example wanna try

292
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:30,590
well everyone is well aware of when I

293
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,820
try

294
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:38,659
we were severely impacted by it when I

295
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:40,580
cry took place in 17th of May 2017 I

296
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:50,210
will never forget that take ever in my

297
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:52,510
life may 16th extortion was carried out

298
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:58,220
through four different addresses

299
00:17:52,510 --> 00:18:00,590
everyone who was committed was it sorted

300
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:05,059
through four different addresses each

301
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:07,939
sample was allocated to an address but

302
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:09,620
when you did the analysis at the end of

303
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,370
the day Joe ended up with four different

304
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,370
addresses

305
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:19,250
well those four different addresses were

306
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,980
the source of income for the person

307
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:25,010
behind when I cry and I can't remember

308
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,409
the actual figure but these person

309
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,679
collected a significant amount of

310
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:33,770
bitcoins what happened that was in

311
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:38,090
August 2017 I remember I was in black

312
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:40,549
hats and fell it said well the whole

313
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:43,158
security community but I said well what

314
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:45,830
was happen let us see when he moves his

315
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:53,090
money because by the time he will move

316
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:56,270
the money he will be hot well bit consum

317
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:58,459
has some degree of anonymity but at the

318
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,350
same time it allows us to find out about

319
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,590
all the transactions that are taking

320
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:05,149
place he plays in he network we don't

321
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,010
know who are the owners of those

322
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,350
addresses but at a given point in time

323
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:12,740
this person will have to exchange

324
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:14,539
bitcoins into money by the time that

325
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,090
exchange will go through a centralized

326
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:21,799
service the anonymity would not longer

327
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:25,899
be there because many exchanged places

328
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:29,450
for cryptocurrencies and kind of now

329
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,210
asking people to identify all the users

330
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:40,859
in their platforms

331
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:40,859
[Music]

332
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:50,920
if you like these type of examples we

333
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:55,809
are 11 paths coverage out research

334
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:59,530
halfway through this year how about

335
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:01,510
these how to lose your anonymity in

336
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,629
Bitcoin because the person behind wanna

337
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:07,840
cry but using bitcoins and here we could

338
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:10,000
see that here we had money but here down

339
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,389
here the money was already being moved

340
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,100
so we had some indications perhaps they

341
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,050
were going through some mixes that is to

342
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,709
say platforms and the exchange of do

343
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,990
given the money the money is moved to

344
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:27,880
other addresses so that with such paper

345
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:32,559
is worth taking a look at this is the

346
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:36,010
first time that this is happening not at

347
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,428
all that happened 15 days ago I can beat

348
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,520
:

349
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:40,420
cash developers and miner says this is

350
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,460
not working

351
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:46,030
however what was the difference between

352
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:50,590
bitkha Bitcoin cash and bit cold gold

353
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:52,000
well we shifted from one megabyte big

354
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,030
difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin

355
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,160
cash Bitcoin allows only one megabyte

356
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,620
whereas Bitcoin cash and those higher

357
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,740
number of megabytes have arranged this

358
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,419
case miners and developers has Bitcoin

359
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,450
is used as a method to anchor

360
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:10,240
information however this is being too

361
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,550
small and now let us move on to bit cash

362
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,600
a bit from cash now says well disease

363
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:18,970
again too small and all the projects

364
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,790
that are being developed as a result of

365
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:25,450
Bitcoin cash our aims are increasing the

366
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:28,200
capacity of each of the blocks so bid

367
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:33,040
conquers maximum of 32 megabytes whereas

368
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:35,800
Bitcoin as V maximum of 128 megabytes to

369
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:39,780
introduce transactions in each of the

370
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:42,550
blocks and we also have other type of

371
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:47,610
protocol modifications and here we had

372
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:50,530
had folks are in new features to our

373
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:53,199
Bitcoin in the case of Bitcoin one

374
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:55,020
example of a soft folk is that of the

375
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,190
multi signature

376
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,799
portfolios in the beginning everyone had

377
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,010
an address and a private key associated

378
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:06,480
to it but then they came out with a new

379
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:10,929
feature that says well Monte signature

380
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:17,140
portfolios where I share wallets and I

381
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:19,179
share my wallets with three people and

382
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,220
then with those three people I can

383
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:23,260
associate or decide on the number of

384
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,230
private keys to be associated to these

385
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,570
people how many private keys they should

386
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,580
have signed for them to have

387
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:34,059
authorization to move their money for

388
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:37,960
instance if I create a company with

389
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:39,990
$20,000 exchange into Bitcoin and I put

390
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,150
them into my wallet and I say that

391
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,370
company belongs to Peppa vandal and I

392
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,990
for however I need the authorization on

393
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,559
the signature on Pepe Emmanuel as a

394
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:54,250
minimum for the movement money to be

395
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:57,250
moved okay so this we sees multi

396
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,230
signature portfolio and this is the way

397
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:04,660
these new features are being just

398
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:06,700
nowadays so now one more question what

399
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,860
about well the Bitcoin transaction is

400
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,840
reported to the rest of the nodes in the

401
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:14,260
network if you go to blockchain that

402
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:18,668
info when we say reporting at the end of

403
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:22,240
the day it is kind of it is stated in

404
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:24,370
the form of a pool pending - we signed

405
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,110
the transaction doesn't gone right away

406
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,570
to the blockchain and you see it

407
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:31,659
reflected the rest of the notes receive

408
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,730
information about a new track session so

409
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,230
we create a pool intersection and then

410
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,020
we will see what we do we do with that

411
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:41,799
and therefore that is followed by mining

412
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:43,990
phase if we go to blockchain info we

413
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:46,918
could see in real time how many track

414
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:50,230
sessions are going into that pool of

415
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,990
penny to reconfirm transactions and we

416
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:56,770
can also estimate the number of nodes in

417
00:23:52,990 --> 00:24:00,510
that the Bitcoin network however when I

418
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:02,200
create a solution based on a blockchain

419
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:05,200
well I find

420
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,799
to be good fun because nowadays I see

421
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,749
many transactions that we only have

422
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:15,309
single notes what do I want to lock

423
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:17,649
chain for if I only have one node one

424
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:19,600
node are in charge of introducing track

425
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:21,789
session in the chain and to anchor them

426
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,070
so it doesn't really make sense to work

427
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:25,960
with a single node only so therefore I

428
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,939
really need to see how many agents how

429
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,659
many stakeholders will they be in my

430
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:34,059
chain whether would allow you may change

431
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:36,789
to half telefónica paraffin and paraffin

432
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:38,769
and orange because we have decided to

433
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:43,529
create a joint solution and young

434
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:46,679
solution and we all have the same

435
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:49,679
authorizations we will all have the same

436
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:52,960
authorization for reading from writing

437
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:56,340
information whether we have to decide

438
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,989
who will be authorized to do what

439
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:01,389
nowadays these capabilities are not

440
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:03,700
properly done we don't even know how

441
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:06,158
many actors will be have in the chain

442
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,470
sometimes when you set up a solution you

443
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,289
are the only one allowed to anchor the

444
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,609
information and this is where all these

445
00:25:11,289 --> 00:25:18,700
kind of doesn't make sense

446
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:21,369
so blockchain that info unconfirmed

447
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,690
transactions then you will get access to

448
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:29,799
all the transactions which are pending

449
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:32,100
confirmation next phase phase number

450
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,100
four

451
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:38,450
so one node will be in charge of adding

452
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:41,420
it to the blockchain I have introduced

453
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,520
some transactions prioritized based on

454
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,790
their fees because miners we said that

455
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,280
it would only include in the block the

456
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:52,940
transactions we have the highest number

457
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:56,180
of fees they will create a block and

458
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:58,910
through the mining process if they are

459
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:02,240
in charge and they are lucky enough to

460
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:04,610
carry out a mathematical operation that

461
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,660
is to say funding a Hodja starting with

462
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:11,530
x0 that is to say difficult Hajj if they

463
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:15,020
would be adding that block to the next

464
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:17,930
blockchain that's mining process to all

465
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,700
chains require mining process well in

466
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:22,310
the case of a single node you don't

467
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,710
really need a mining process Jamaica say

468
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,379
yeah well book chain is a contribution

469
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,180
it's good for me even if I'm alone but

470
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,240
if you are alone why do you want a

471
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,430
mining process you will be the only one

472
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,520
carrying out those transactions at the

473
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:40,360
end of the day you are wising to energy

474
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,700
[Music]

475
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:46,250
sometimes to decide those who do any

476
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,920
mining process and to use blockchain

477
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:51,800
only as a way to anchor information like

478
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,980
kind of time stamping information that

479
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,889
is to say if you want to say to any

480
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:00,410
third party or to your clients that that

481
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:03,800
information has taken place at this

482
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:07,640
specific time point and that it cannot

483
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:12,649
be erased that cannot be changed well

484
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:16,150
that could be another possibility that

485
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:19,550
you could have and as we said before

486
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:25,970
here in the Bitcoin in the beginning you

487
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:28,010
could ask you PC to do some mining for

488
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,350
you and you could make some money but

489
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:34,400
now you are giving all your computing

490
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:36,830
power to a mining pool and if the mining

491
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,110
pool is lucky enough to find that hash

492
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:41,350
to do that mathematical calculation and

493
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:46,389
to add that block

494
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:52,330
you could return you can get some one

495
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:57,130
payoff money invested if someone asks

496
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:59,740
you what blockchain is about there is

497
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:05,380
this platform under skom which is a

498
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:09,150
website on where we can visually

499
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,150
understand what blockchain is about

500
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:17,380
formation on each block that will be

501
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:20,408
translated that will be seen in the rest

502
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:23,100
of the notes the rest of the notes could

503
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:26,500
report that that byte has been changed

504
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:29,490
imagine this is Genesis block this is

505
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:35,559
the name that the first block receives

506
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:37,419
its own block number one well in the bid

507
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,250
cons at the end of the day we are adding

508
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:45,789
on transactions that is to say I am

509
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:50,980
adding on information my system through

510
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:52,360
which I check the money that I'm setting

511
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,730
out or the money that someone is

512
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:58,479
receiving I say okay this is the address

513
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:01,900
this is Jessa Jessa is sending out these

514
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,880
money to Felix Felix will be represented

515
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:08,350
through a different address Jessa sends

516
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,299
out 80 bitcoins to Felix I could hear

517
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:12,189
carry out as many transactions as I

518
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:13,900
would like to what is the information in

519
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,720
this block the block contains all this

520
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:20,500
information which is number of the block

521
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,480
then the name then the data that I want

522
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,090
to anchor in the chain and then the

523
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,210
previous hash that's Genesis block and

524
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:32,459
therefore that previous information will

525
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:35,500
be 0 0 0 and this is the mining process

526
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:39,250
miners will have to carry out a

527
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:43,480
mathematical operation whose hash starts

528
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:47,409
in a different manner and no and then we

529
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:50,360
will have to calculate field nose then

530
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:53,360
you click on one and then do

531
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,870
click on mine and the size no it has not

532
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,090
been received number two it doesn't not

533
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:01,669
successful not successful you don't come

534
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:07,459
out to this resort and then when you

535
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:09,110
calculate it that do sixty five thousand

536
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:13,010
six hundred and ninety three and I say

537
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:17,719
yes I found a hash has with the level of

538
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:19,580
complexity that you have told me next

539
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,670
book this is that it is a block chain

540
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:30,500
next one same operation lock to data

541
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:36,170
Felix and in bidder there's number of

542
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:39,710
bitcoins information in the block

543
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:42,940
information for the previous hash we

544
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:47,240
carry out the same operation of mining

545
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:54,230
until we reach a number which is this

546
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:58,040
one here with this hash okay and then

547
00:30:54,230 --> 00:31:00,700
again in the end this information is

548
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,740
replicated by every node in the network

549
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:07,760
the information has been duplicated and

550
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:10,970
the information if we modify any byte of

551
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,450
information in there and we say yes is

552
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:18,740
sending fifteen sort of 82 Felix it

553
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:23,840
would be in red it's a way a visual way

554
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:26,270
of saying modifying information that

555
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:30,919
it's already anchored this would be

556
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:33,770
visible for the rest of nodes in the

557
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:40,429
network face five

558
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:43,220
see information in this plot is linked

559
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:49,820
that's what we've seen in Anders comm

560
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:53,600
website okay our system which uses

561
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:55,189
blockchain is complies with the

562
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,570
regulation and ear protection my

563
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:01,400
colleague has here she's had to see me

564
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:03,620
when we started to ask this question I

565
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,530
caught and I said I've have a huge

566
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:09,530
problem because I'd never realize about

567
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:10,970
this I've been working with plugs in for

568
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:15,820
many years and now I need to have a

569
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:18,860
solution the regulation is in force and

570
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,629
the main characteristics of this is that

571
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:29,360
the information isn't changeable I

572
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:33,040
cannot erase it what do I do now and you

573
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,860
see other solutions and you see I am

574
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:39,980
creating a huge wonderful architecture

575
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:42,620
to comply with the regulation because I

576
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,900
cannot erase my data and we see the

577
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,850
solutions implemented by other people

578
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,770
not in telefónica and other companies

579
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,300
and the magical the million-dollar

580
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,790
question is does it comply with the

581
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:56,870
regulation and they say oh we did not

582
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:59,059
think about it well you should start to

583
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:02,360
think to prepare everything to modify

584
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:04,670
your architecture because it's not it's

585
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:08,030
going to be worthless for a hackathon it

586
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:11,150
could be useful something that it's not

587
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,770
good to be used by hundreds of thousands

588
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,770
of users but when the user needs the

589
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:18,350
power to erase their data will be

590
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,929
stirred sweat why because of this

591
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,909
because information isn't changeable you

592
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:27,410
cannot erase information you cannot

593
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:31,610
change it so any person with a copy of

594
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:35,270
that database would have a list with all

595
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:39,860
the operations and if at some point you

596
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:42,860
can track that an IPS like the pepper

597
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,780
Betty it's not just you the one having

598
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,889
the information on your users but you're

599
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:50,340
sharing it with by the phone and

600
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:54,720
who knows who else they could say okay

601
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:56,669
I read this whole I be I have the list

602
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,010
of the separation this person has this

603
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:01,860
amount of money or potatoes I don't care

604
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:08,239
well this person has consumed this

605
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:14,580
amount of energy before that the

606
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:17,908
solution we have is that is taking into

607
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:25,100
account the information we anchor we

608
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:28,080
don't Unger it raw this IP which

609
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,389
represents pepper pellets this address

610
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:37,790
which represents telephonic about that

611
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:37,790
phone carries out transaction which

612
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:44,720
represents web app edit in Bitcoin there

613
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:49,199
are native

614
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:51,029
any person can see that a person has

615
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,310
sent three bitcoins to another person

616
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,380
there are the blog's he do not allow me

617
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:58,470
to anchor information I can just carry

618
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:02,040
out operations and an ID of the

619
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:04,879
transaction has been recorded an address

620
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,779
there is a transaction to all the

621
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,460
address but the information is not

622
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,670
anchored then you have some sort of

623
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:15,600
space where you can anchor information

624
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:17,970
but you don't anchor a hash the ankara

625
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,850
hajj and it represents information if

626
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:23,910
stored another database and that you can

627
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:27,170
comply with the regulation because you

628
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:30,600
can erase in your traditional date base

629
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:32,190
because the only thing that it would

630
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,290
have there it's a hash of a transaction

631
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,290
which would not represent anything

632
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:45,970
and this is very important

633
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:48,940
bob says he can use the bitcoins

634
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:52,180
received from Alice but does the client

635
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:54,220
value that additional value offered by

636
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,910
using this technology the other day I

637
00:35:54,220 --> 00:36:00,850
read a paper that said there's only 8

638
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:07,470
percent of the Spanish population hadn't

639
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:07,470
even heard about blockchain so

640
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:15,320
I think in this case well when we create

641
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:17,210
a solution we need to work with legal

642
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,510
department but also with the

643
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:22,340
communication department I'm using a

644
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,160
technology which provides a lot of value

645
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:32,270
but if people don't know what it is what

646
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:33,920
am i doing people don't value this we

647
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,740
need to highlight the capabilities

648
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:42,400
provided by it for example the most

649
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:45,729
important use cases when we give this

650
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,390
information when the user is provided

651
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:50,030
with the possibility of being

652
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:51,950
transparent if my use case is about

653
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:55,480
transparency for the user and I'm

654
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:58,779
anchoring the information a private

655
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,780
chain block

656
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:18,140
what am i doing so my conclusion yes I

657
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:19,790
skipped something another question you

658
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:24,589
anchor the information and the

659
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:26,470
information cannot be changed but who

660
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:29,420
says that that information is not false

661
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,649
the we haven't carried out a previous

662
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,740
action which is validating the

663
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:37,850
information anchored that it's real or

664
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:40,580
maybe it's a mistake I may have done

665
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,650
operation behind this and I see I need a

666
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,049
transaction for this user for this

667
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,660
telefónica coins but that transaction

668
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:50,080
was wrong and i anchored 7 it's a

669
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,080
mistake

670
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:59,330
so this translates as i we can use

671
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,990
blockchain but when it makes sense it

672
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:04,759
gives us persistent persistence which is

673
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:08,509
not something very useful because it can

674
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,460
be achieved differently traceability yes

675
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:16,840
everything is registered integrity

676
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:19,610
information ok because you can validate

677
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,040
somehow that the information hasn't been

678
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:25,070
manipulated and Emily needed

679
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:31,490
intermediaries okay with it cerium

680
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:37,700
blockchain you can automatic first years

681
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:39,680
cases I thought it was going it was

682
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:43,509
going to be too long as to have half my

683
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,830
presentation to go first his case

684
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:48,830
starting information the beginning

685
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:51,290
information was stored in addresses when

686
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:57,330
transactions were worthless but now we

687
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:59,910
cannot do that anymore so in 2013

688
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:04,830
and you field appeared with which is

689
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:07,710
Opie return where we can anchor maximum

690
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,980
80 bytes of information at some you

691
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,730
don't

692
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:13,830
anchor something that represents a

693
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:18,690
document and represent something

694
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:25,819
something else but you cannot carry out

695
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:26,940
other operations so we used other

696
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,270
alternatives

697
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:34,260
okay allow this traceability because my

698
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:36,390
music public blockchain such as Bitcoin

699
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:40,380
but I have to pivot to other

700
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:42,690
decentralized networks anchoring a

701
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:46,080
pointer to another network such as the

702
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:49,890
case of ipfs this technology is widely

703
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:57,000
used and combined with plug chains ipfs

704
00:39:49,890 --> 00:40:02,129
or mecco trees there's a project by the

705
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:05,010
MIT free software which is great for

706
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:09,660
university certificates or whatever

707
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:12,120
I imagine University wickets because

708
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,790
we've has a problem about this in Spain

709
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:18,290
and I said well this is the solution the

710
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:22,110
solution they suggest with Merkel trees

711
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:25,770
it's not that each person getting the

712
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:27,150
degree needs decayed to do a transaction

713
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:32,340
for it

714
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:37,620
certificate in a traditional case the

715
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:39,450
university should say my university

716
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:42,750
address has which transmitted another

717
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:45,359
address representing the student I've

718
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:50,520
issued a certificate okay you got the

719
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:52,440
certificate at this point but if you

720
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:56,700
I don't know how many students are there

721
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,180
at university a thousand thousands of

722
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,770
students refining thousands of

723
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:04,440
preparations in bitcoins well should

724
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:07,830
prepare the money so at the end what

725
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,160
they do is anchoring the Merkur routes

726
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:13,250
in the blockchain if I'm going to check

727
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,520
this address it's going to tell me that

728
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:20,369
it matches and it is within that merkel

729
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,310
rubbed I think it's better explained

730
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:26,640
here by Catrice help us to optimize the

731
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:30,600
anchoring process of existent evidence

732
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,339
we use blockchain to test to prove that

733
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,220
something has happened because they give

734
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:38,460
us tools to confirm that a document has

735
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:40,980
been used to create the hash at the

736
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:44,960
origin this has been used some of them

737
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:48,450
have been used together the Mecca route

738
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,630
micro route and once the Merkur wood has

739
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:56,480
been confirmed we confirmed that this

740
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:56,480
certificate belongs to that marker would

741
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:02,750
privacy by design or security by design

742
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,450
why because at the beginning when we

743
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:11,629
started to use this type of systems

744
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:15,830
people said okay addresses are linked to

745
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:20,030
regular users but addresses are

746
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:22,940
personally data themselves if we have a

747
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:25,610
traceability that tells us that this

748
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,130
address corresponds to paper petted and

749
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:31,310
as I've said before depending on how we

750
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,000
anchor the information if it cannot be

751
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,610
erased

752
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,960
we wouldn't be complying with article 17

753
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:42,050
of the regulation current trends with

754
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,150
regards to privacy there are three

755
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:52,010
projects I'm in love with which are

756
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:52,760
Monet dou Z cache and - here has privacy

757
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,880
by design

758
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,640
this doesn't have privacy by design but

759
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:02,420
at any given time I would know the

760
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:07,850
addresses we couldn't mask theology the

761
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:11,270
destination of every transaction taking

762
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:13,279
place in this networks and then security

763
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:15,530
by design I come from the security world

764
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,560
I am worried and concerned about the

765
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:23,270
years of security in the past we've seen

766
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:25,790
many samples of malware that steal the

767
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:30,490
computation capabilities of machines

768
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:33,170
that are mining this is just an example

769
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:37,779
but there are millions of families of

770
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,780
malware doing this another problem

771
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,368
know that I compromised the computation

772
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:48,660
capabilities I expose a website for

773
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:51,809
example in which I include JavaScript

774
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:54,000
code and out of each person that

775
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:57,230
connects to my website

776
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,450
they were reminding for me this is legal

777
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:02,849
if you include a warning but that

778
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:05,609
website do not usually include any

779
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:07,260
warning that they're mining they're

780
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:11,848
using the computation capabilities of

781
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:14,430
your equipment there was investigation

782
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:19,039
carried by Felix you can read it on

783
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:22,169
eleven paths blog and what a coincidence

784
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:26,880
do you know what websites types of what

785
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:31,049
science uses this system most of them

786
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,760
belong our video websites or porn yeah

787
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:36,509
they take advantage of that the father

788
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:44,940
you'd just spend a while in the specific

789
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:47,329
website or when Real Madrid plays

790
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:51,990
football websites will you watch

791
00:44:47,329 --> 00:44:55,349
football matches that type of threats

792
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,910
can be detected in this size because

793
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:59,700
they know that they're going you're

794
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:03,569
going to be connected to the website for

795
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:09,058
a while how can we protect them I love

796
00:45:03,569 --> 00:45:12,930
this project it's by Spanish team gold

797
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:15,960
mining they've created an extension and

798
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:20,000
it's time you connect to a website they

799
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,000
inform you whether it's mining or not

800
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:28,920
this the project we've seen such as

801
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:30,210
Krypton and we see there are the types

802
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,800
of mobile samples

803
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:38,810
I think they existed the beginning of

804
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:43,500
this year in deep web pages or in some

805
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:47,310
forum people sold and bought more well

806
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:50,010
that monitors a clipboard you cannot

807
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:52,350
learn Bitcoin addresses by heart you

808
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,440
copy and paste and when you copy that

809
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:57,569
information will go to the clipboard and

810
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,940
there's malware that monitors that's

811
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:02,910
some strings that correspond to a

812
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:06,300
Bitcoin address when I they had identify

813
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:08,310
the exchanged please with the address of

814
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,820
the attackers so when I'm going to carry

815
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:14,279
out a transaction but this has already

816
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,110
happened in the banking system what

817
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,240
we're seeing with this system is that

818
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:21,060
every threat coming from the banking

819
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,970
system disappearing now you copy and

820
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:26,370
paste the address to which you want to

821
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,350
send money and it's replaced at that

822
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:30,060
point by the attacker you think that

823
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:32,310
you've sent money to your friend and

824
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:36,029
you're sending to a third party and

825
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:41,370
that's something that's happening the

826
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:42,690
set of final question to take home is do

827
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,279
we have a clear idea of the problem

828
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,650
their technology helps us to solve

829
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:50,820
sometimes the product manager comes and

830
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:53,730
he says have you seen and you use case

831
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:56,970
and I say oh no I need to analyze now if

832
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:59,880
this makes sense if they're actually

833
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:05,910
taking advantage of the capabilities or

834
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:08,520
I'm just getting carried away by the

835
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:12,629
situation in the market or the name of

836
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,910
this technology so that's what we should

837
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,770
bear in mind characteristics of the

838
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,810
technology are we applying them

839
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:22,160
correctly

840
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:25,580
does anyone have any question any doubt

841
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,580
about blockchain

842
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:44,720
well this is not a question I would like

843
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,069
to say but you've shown an extension

844
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,439
against crypto mining

845
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:56,480
yeah knocked mining what's the name not

846
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:58,880
mining it's a project by some Spanish

847
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,329
guys it's an extension installing your

848
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,460
navigator and it informs you when you

849
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:07,640
connect to a website informs you whether

850
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:14,589
the website is mining and you see

851
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:18,170
because your CPU starts to work and then

852
00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:21,200
gee do you know any app for computers

853
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:23,299
could you please share my presentations

854
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,430
the some navigators already include that

855
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:27,430
type of alert I think Opera

856
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,400
but

857
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:40,629
video games for example include krypter

858
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:47,980
mining but we're speaking about websites

859
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:51,220
it depends on the the web but not I'm

860
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:54,099
speaking at PC level not the navigation

861
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:58,890
I cannot hear your question a knowledge

862
00:48:54,099 --> 00:49:08,849
version of a torrent the torrent sites

863
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:12,460
tend to have this type of threats the

864
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:16,359
paper in 11 the post 11 paths blog

865
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:19,930
there's a list where there's a

866
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:24,460
probability or at least the first 100

867
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:26,680
dominium in Alexa the most significant

868
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:29,080
most relevant ones in the internet and

869
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:36,759
we analyzable that they had crypt

870
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:39,940
remaining crypt alert and we saw it was

871
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,570
this one's torrent or web sites where

872
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:45,130
you're going to watch a football team

873
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:47,970
but they know that you can spend a while

874
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:51,490
in that side it's an alternative

875
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:55,080
mechanism to advertising but you can do

876
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,080
it if you inform the user

877
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:03,019
no wait

878
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:15,049
