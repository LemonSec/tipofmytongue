2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,640
well apologies for the technical issues

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,070
now we have a release of them so the

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,050
title of our presentation is death from

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:33,730
above and we believe that drones

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:36,250
nowadays be used for well in further

7
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:39,099
personal purposes surveillance

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:47,200
monitoring recording however drones are

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:49,360
also using for criminal activities so

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,320
this presentation is intended as sharing

11
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,530
with you the most frequently found

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,980
problems with drones but not a disguise

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:05,349
okay we are just offering that for

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:07,719
information purposes so well my name is

15
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:09,729
David Moreno pentester responsive enough

16
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:14,399
security of drones in data security and

17
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:18,579
my name is Nicolas no engineer I tecum

18
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:22,270
IT engineer and I'm also an expert in

19
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:25,270
security so legal warning but we will be

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:31,359
showing here it is will be shown only

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:33,689
for teaching purposes so we are not

22
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:37,298
responsible we are not liable for any

23
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:40,958
materials that you may be using as a

24
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:44,469
result of from our presentation so first

25
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:47,020
of all what is drone

26
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:48,729
well actually drones were not defined in

27
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:54,899
the Spanish dictionary of language up

28
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:54,899
until 2014 which is an unmanned

29
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:05,430
aircraft so our pas is also another term

30
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,990
used for drones actually they mean the

31
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,289
same thing but the only thing that

32
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,319
changes is whether they are remotely

33
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:17,299
well both have remotely operated but in

34
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:20,700
the case of a V they are autonomous

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,430
vehicles the autonomous vehicles have

36
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,829
produced tracking and they can be

37
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:30,510
followed remotely without having an

38
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:34,799
actual operator handling it so here this

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:43,048
is a graph showing where all these

40
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:46,260
started it is started bucking 2014 and

41
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:50,280
we've seen the great evolution of it as

42
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:55,200
of the last year we see these Peaks

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:58,049
often they take part in December we are

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,339
not going to disclose why they peak at

45
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:06,989
December but anyway they pick okay what

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:10,019
are the methods used to control drone we

47
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:15,420
have bluetooth this is for toy drones

48
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:19,140
drones so to speak let's say they do not

49
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:24,779
fly over 12 meters then we have Wi-Fi

50
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:28,078
also to control toy drones and then

51
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:32,640
there are other type of controls RF 3G

52
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:35,099
4G satellite GPS for a more professional

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,690
control of

54
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:43,480
military or other type of professional

55
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:46,590
drones so according to Royal Decree in

56
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,970
first since 31st of December 2017

57
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,489
differences have been made between two

58
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,909
type of drones depending on the use made

59
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:57,579
of them some but we will be focusing on

60
00:03:54,909 --> 00:04:00,700
those that are below two kilograms in

61
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:02,590
weight and well we have two types of

62
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,730
them professional use and for free

63
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:10,900
creational use Royal Decree also

64
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:14,349
describes toy drones drones that is to

65
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:18,010
say those that are below 250 grams and

66
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:20,500
they cannot reach higher than 20 meters

67
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,728
and this is the decree that will have

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,530
produced them ourselves

69
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:29,830
well we have named it the Royal Decree

70
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,869
Niko and David 2018 so we have the toy

71
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:35,830
drones two small drones professional

72
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:38,410
drones well if you ever go to the

73
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,270
mountains and you can hear drone flying

74
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:48,010
around you often we are referring to

75
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:50,919
this type of drones and so let's see if

76
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:54,460
you are walking around the city for

77
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:58,330
instance in the park you may hear a

78
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,760
drone around you from a neighbor who is

79
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,120
making a recording and these are also

80
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,880
professional drones and then well we

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:12,039
have these bracing ones they are very

82
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,889
small very agile they go around 360

83
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:18,010
degrees like really fast they rotate

84
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:20,929
really fast and then we have in the last

85
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:26,188
place military drums these are av

86
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:30,359
and the dress of the wings maybe of five

87
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:32,610
meters as wide of this stage so

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,189
regarding drones manufacturers the most

89
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:40,649
well-known are DJ I para 3d our GoPro

90
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:42,719
decided to withdraw from the market they

91
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:44,969
focused on a different business activity

92
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:47,669
and then the rest of the manufacturers

93
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:50,520
do toy drones we have also added general

94
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:53,128
atomics which is the main manufacturer

95
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,979
of military drones and again we have

96
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:59,899
another graph graph about the current

97
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:03,719
situation in the through in the drone of

98
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:08,219
market of drones and then DJ has is

99
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:12,419
ranking first so we are not we are not

100
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:15,899
intending to sell you drones so we just

101
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:18,719
want to show the different types of

102
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:23,099
drones and the price at which they are

103
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:26,279
sold so regarding toy drones no prices

104
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:29,628
range from 43 to 80 euros so that is to

105
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:34,558
say affordable very affordable then

106
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:38,849
raising drones that they are between 150

107
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:41,459
and 300 euros so some of them are more

108
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:44,550
elegant and others we can also print

109
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:47,879
them out in a 3d printer and then we'd

110
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,469
like to share this gift with you so if

111
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:52,439
you have good posed you have good

112
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:56,119
reflexes and ukemi' succeed at doing

113
00:06:52,439 --> 00:07:00,179
that well you can see how far you can

114
00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:04,979
get imagine what happens with espionage

115
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:07,799
missions with military missions I'm now

116
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:10,710
going back to professional drones

117
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,960
here I would like to refer to the

118
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:18,180
cheapest one from 233 euro stroll DJ I

119
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,020
do look at the components then you

120
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:26,129
assemble it and then you can

121
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:28,460
well the price can go up and then when

122
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:33,210
the price depends very much on the

123
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:36,960
quality of the camera in it so here we

124
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:40,020
have this first image this drone has

125
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,440
bolting it in case of forest fires these

126
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,229
balls and launched and then the fire is

127
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,530
put out the second one belongs to the

128
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:52,378
enforcement agencies and this is used

129
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:56,758
for surveillance and the last one is

130
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:59,310
from dij and it can be adapted to the

131
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,490
demands of the client can be used for

132
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:05,069
recording filming surveillance whatever

133
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,009
purpose the client wants to give to it

134
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,110
last we have the enjoy AVS and military

135
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:13,289
ones will be kind of pack them in our

136
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,139
home courage and well the price of 5

137
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:19,830
million euros I could not afford any of

138
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:24,029
them even if to save money all my life

139
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:27,180
and now I would like to share to you the

140
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:29,610
some of the possible uses sake let's try

141
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:35,339
case a UAV that was bought by the

142
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:39,479
Ukraine army so there are five drivers

143
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:41,820
the flight operator different towers and

144
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,630
then it cleans up the horizon opens up

145
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,630
the horizon

146
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:58,600
well these could just prevent human

147
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,630
casualties of human death well it is

148
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,540
interesting to highlight from here well

149
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:08,050
on the Left we have the mission plan the

150
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:11,649
controller program so this is a

151
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:14,790
screenshot of our PC and on the right

152
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:20,589
we'll have the do AV the mission planner

153
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:23,439
operated by the Ukraine army officers

154
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:26,230
and we see that it this is just exactly

155
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,269
the same this means that anyone can

156
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:34,750
access this program and use the program

157
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:36,790
but must say wish and then course wallet

158
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,970
I don't know whether you have played

159
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:42,579
this game or not but imagine that you

160
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,920
have a very crowded area and you want to

161
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:49,899
find a specific target how can you do

162
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:53,529
that but again we break down our

163
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:56,440
philosophy we came we live in Madrid and

164
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:58,839
then in July nanako's it's very hard you

165
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,100
want to sleep all the time so this is

166
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:07,449
the average temperature so no rainfall

167
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:09,910
it's 1:00 a.m. you can sleep the next

168
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:14,819
day you have to wake up at 7 a.m. and

169
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:19,980
all of the sudden you hear these noise

170
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:19,979
so that did that happen to you

171
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:29,250
I will stop it now I asked the people

172
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,839
that I know if they could describe the

173
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,720
sensations and feelings that they had

174
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,269
when they could hear these busts and

175
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,100
people say well this is very negative

176
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:42,930
feeling anxiety paranoia panic and only

177
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,060
one person said when I'm never bitten by

178
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,849
mosquitoes and as Wells we are very very

179
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,829
lucky so I would like to ask you the

180
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,009
very same question but this time when

181
00:10:49,829 --> 00:11:04,709
you hear this sound well hopefully you

182
00:10:53,009 --> 00:11:06,300
will not go deaf Oh apologies now so

183
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:12,060
does it ring a bell to you see familiar

184
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:15,060
to you I stop I ask the same question to

185
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:19,888
my friends and they answered the

186
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:22,619
following well one said well probably he

187
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:25,949
will take better pictures and mine I

188
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:30,990
want one for myself oh that's awesome

189
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:33,449
how does it work some people also

190
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,889
expressed a fear of being recorded and

191
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:41,000
they said that that generated mistrust

192
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:43,740
so have you ever considered that the

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,089
sound that we associated with mosquitoes

194
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,459
could be in the future

195
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:49,230
associated with drones have you ever

196
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:50,729
thought about - well actually we

197
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,339
couldn't bring this drone with us

198
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:57,240
because we were our suitcase was already

199
00:11:53,339 --> 00:12:00,029
very heavy so we use this toy drone and

200
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,430
then we thought about some of the things

201
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:05,519
we could do with it well using an

202
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,939
optical sensor for facial recognition we

203
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,819
could also do have a behavior in badness

204
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:13,769
through several drones simultaneously we

205
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:16,410
could identify targets we could do very

206
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:19,170
many things with it so now it is the

207
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,529
graph or the image on the left focus on

208
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:25,920
that this was propaganda appetizing then

209
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:27,929
against the use of drones in the UK

210
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,998
and as you can see they were using a

211
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:34,290
mini drum carrying three grams of

212
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:37,829
explosive just to kill or to destroy a

213
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:42,719
mannequin well everyone who has watched

214
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:47,099
this video has been very much frightened

215
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,279
well this is fake but if you wanted you

216
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:53,369
could do it and on the right this is

217
00:12:50,279 --> 00:13:00,559
what we did with our toy drone 99 euros

218
00:12:53,369 --> 00:13:04,709
but we did was to fly it and as he was

219
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:08,040
flying did facial recognition we didn't

220
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:10,439
add 3 grams of explosive I did just

221
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,809
didn't want to be killed by it and as

222
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:16,529
you can see the drone is out all the

223
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:21,329
time well recognizing my face so how

224
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:26,549
much real is this let us do a timeline

225
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:29,638
with the news briefing seen recently so

226
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:36,269
in 2014 Isis launched this propaganda

227
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:39,239
video so were they just a drone similar

228
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:41,850
to this one here we will look at it in

229
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:45,540
greater detail later on Hannah was a

230
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:49,139
drone the dropped bombs they were

231
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:52,290
killing and people were being killed so

232
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,929
in this second image here right on top

233
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:58,399
of the gif when this drone is exactly

234
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:58,399
the same as this one

235
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,459
in this case we have classified this

236
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:09,459
threat as terrorism

237
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,290
so this

238
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:24,650
so the news in the UK was that drones

239
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:27,800
were used to introduce drugs into UK

240
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:30,170
prisons so you may watch the video well

241
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,140
the whole process is recorded in the

242
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,689
video and in this case that I said the

243
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,910
positive outcome for the bad guys was of

244
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:42,950
amounted to five hundred thousand euros

245
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:49,540
so other news that followed vandalism so

246
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:55,180
a famous graffiti maker used a drone to

247
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:58,819
stamp his signature piece of advertising

248
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:02,870
well this was considered to be an act of

249
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:06,170
vandalism while an opposite completely

250
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:09,830
different thing is citizen security it

251
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:12,640
was a person who wanted to record a game

252
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:15,410
in the US Open in America then the door

253
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,780
crashed against its it received that

254
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,329
fortunately it was empty the person was

255
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:26,810
arrested Ram was prosecuted was taken to

256
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:29,540
court for that so well ignore the gift

257
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:33,430
and in this case transferred used for

258
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:42,079
espionage it was being said that seven

259
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:45,170
nuclear power plants were inspired with

260
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,210
drones in the last two years with free

261
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,500
wing please did not claim responsibility

262
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,180
for us but anyway the drones were

263
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:57,560
invading critical infrastructure and

264
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:00,589
that is classified as crime other type

265
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,209
of terrorism a Japanese passengers the

266
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:07,470
drone to

267
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:15,110
put radioactive material on the rooftop

268
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:18,780
of Japan Prime Minister as a way to

269
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:25,350
protest against the nuclear campaign

270
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:30,990
launched by Japan Prime Minister Najib

271
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:37,650
you haven't seen that a drone has gone

272
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:42,090
very close to aircraft and as I said the

273
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:46,319
drone had jeopardized the operation of

274
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:50,940
the helicopter and then in 2018 case of

275
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,550
nicolas maduro apparent assassination

276
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:57,030
attempt

277
00:16:52,550 --> 00:17:03,349
so no casualties as a result of it we

278
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:08,690
see here the bodyguards preventing the

279
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:12,510
attack is this accessible to everyone

280
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:15,530
can we have access to these things that

281
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,530
we are seeing the video

282
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:24,979
well the attacks we've seen so far were

283
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:32,210
about the person controlling and hunting

284
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:34,970
a drone so now we can really see whether

285
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,710
you I don't know I draw in itself to

286
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,840
something which is more science fiction

287
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:42,230
I don't know going to a place attacking

288
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,629
a person and making decisions and

289
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,940
therefore the first thing that think we

290
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,570
thought that was needed for that was

291
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,149
first of all having a drone well then we

292
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,850
know that drones and you come buy them

293
00:17:53,149 --> 00:18:01,729
off the shelf or you can also make them

294
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:07,340
yourselves suffering says if you visit

295
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:10,070
two Chinese websites so you see a drone

296
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,490
that has been used by Isis to for

297
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:16,789
propaganda and then you can see it on

298
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:20,330
sale top photograph it's nearly two

299
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:23,090
hundred euros and if not well three

300
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:26,658
euros you buy these cards or this

301
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:30,289
plastic and you can print it out in a 3d

302
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:32,720
printer also when you search for this

303
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:35,740
type of drone on the internet you see

304
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,419
the Sachi and then well these are their

305
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:42,970
components and then you can build it

306
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:48,690
yourself so for the electronics

307
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:52,630
electronics is very affordable

308
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:58,559
different type of controllers running

309
00:18:52,630 --> 00:19:01,450
different software different features or

310
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,389
if you are hunter than that and you can

311
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,029
even want to save more money you can

312
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:15,120
build your own controllers who are doing

313
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:17,320
no or others well anyway as I say to

314
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:23,620
manufacture your own controller you will

315
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:25,840
have to be very very crafty well and we

316
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,770
tried it we try it ourselves this is our

317
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,580
homemade

318
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:35,139
drone Arduino the sensors are being read

319
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:41,889
here the values that we are getting and

320
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:44,590
as it can very economical drone so with

321
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,799
this we need that you don't really need

322
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:53,279
to spend lots of money to have your

323
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:57,220
drone you if you invest between 50 and

324
00:19:53,279 --> 00:20:00,929
110 euros you can end up with a good

325
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:05,649
quality drone so these are other

326
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:08,710
homemade drones so we have here the

327
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:13,779
trick copter and then we have these

328
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:17,769
wings that we also made ourselves

329
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:21,869
come once we have our drone well now we

330
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:26,049
should start thinking about evil plans

331
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:28,629
well some of the evil plans could be as

332
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:31,960
followed well we could add very many

333
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:39,639
optic sensors and cameras were drone for

334
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:45,239
free cub surveillance and spying I flew

335
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:48,939
the drone around my home and this is a

336
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:57,460
3d mapping that I made of the area where

337
00:20:48,940 --> 00:21:02,159
I live so we could do spiash activities

338
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:07,690
real-time if we are an infrared camera

339
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:10,869
or a drone we could fly the area and spy

340
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:17,080
it other things that also came to mind

341
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:19,029
were to follow it we could use our drone

342
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,580
to detect people

343
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:30,279
so with this time we set up a circuit

344
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:35,408
looking for the MA scenes of a mobile

345
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:39,789
phone so that to locate people and then

346
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:42,609
if we were we would really would check

347
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:48,519
the Mac that we defined against the mac

348
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:50,649
that we have found so when the Mac is

349
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:54,159
detected a message is sent out to the

350
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:56,589
drone and the drone tells us where the

351
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:01,570
devices and this could be very good for

352
00:21:56,589 --> 00:22:04,270
instance to search for a person who is

353
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,790
lost or who needs help

354
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:10,600
another type of attack that we could

355
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:21,100
launch be an autonomous attack as we

356
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:24,000
have seen in the propaganda video even

357
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:28,510
if it was fake okay the trolls were

358
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,580
autonomously flying and there were no

359
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,309
controlling partner of anyone but we

360
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,760
could program a mission we could have a

361
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:39,010
peripheral to the drone asking the drone

362
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,390
to interact with the controller and by

363
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,030
the time the drone reaches its

364
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:46,380
destination could launch an attack and

365
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:51,160
well as we can see here in the video

366
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:53,890
this is my friend David flying his drone

367
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,100
in the countryside has sent out the

368
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,290
drone to coordinates that's exactly

369
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,290
where he is

370
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:04,030
okay the drone will stop by the time

371
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:06,159
we'll reach him and then we'll launch an

372
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:10,360
attack we wanted to do that life but we

373
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,820
just didn't want to damage this this

374
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,550
place were the screens or the roof and

375
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,710
this is what it did it just launched the

376
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:23,290
attack

377
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:26,620
so these bomb we brought it with us so

378
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:30,250
and this is well it was very easy for

379
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:33,850
the drone to drop the attack another

380
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:37,059
attack that we also thought about was

381
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,909
more science fiction attack it was about

382
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,920
flying the drone to a destination and

383
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:45,790
then having the drone choosing his

384
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:49,570
targets so we included an algorithm for

385
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:52,299
the drone to detect people and then find

386
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:56,080
those people at destination and

387
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:58,690
attacked me so he is David running

388
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,718
before the drone the drone is trying to

389
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:11,469
chase him the drone is getting ready

390
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:13,599
wants to chase him so flying drone is

391
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:16,450
flying through the coordinates we have

392
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,249
given to it and these are the targets

393
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,759
when the drone finds the target for

394
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,759
attacks

395
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:33,690
are you frightened third you are

396
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:33,690
comfortable seeing all that okay

397
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:41,529
defensive so this was a controversial

398
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:44,019
news as saying that well to stop one of

399
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:46,779
these drones you have to spend three

400
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:51,600
million artillery so which should be the

401
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:55,419
balance that what is actually profitable

402
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,129
for are the current defense methods well

403
00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:00,279
on the one hand would you have to use

404
00:24:57,129 --> 00:25:04,889
your imagination okay setting up nets in

405
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:10,289
case trouble comes by the Nets kind of

406
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:10,289
well the the drone is caught in the net

407
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:22,299
so what is currently being done are

408
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:26,279
jammers jammers we measure the frequency

409
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:29,220
of the drone and then the drone is

410
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:33,000
blocked and then it falls down also

411
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:37,710
lasers that are used to fly the drone

412
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,710
and also we use hijacking

413
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,940
or big drum companies offer a

414
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,370
cloud-based service when they log all

415
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,320
the information for the flight well we

416
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:54,030
know it's very difficult to access to

417
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,409
that log to that information because we

418
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:58,950
know that there are dedicated people

419
00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:02,190
working in cybersecurity but well that

420
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:08,910
could be done and then we have microwave

421
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:11,370
Canyon that use animals and that was

422
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:13,230
highly criticized because it was sent

423
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:18,300
our egos that were trained to detect

424
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:20,820
drones and to stop them did not ignore

425
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,950
the instructions of people giving

426
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,500
distractions and then we could say what

427
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:29,750
happens if we just throw something right

428
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:32,760
away to the drone through a water hose

429
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,160
well it would be difficult to reach the

430
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,060
drone we can also do this proofing or

431
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,190
the Wi-Fi and we could also try to

432
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:43,379
attack it right away the application

433
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:49,440
that the client is using to communicate

434
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:51,450
with patrol defense against drones

435
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,010
already exists in some of those problems

436
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:58,320
they have to solve it's very often that

437
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:03,629
a drone is not a standard one for

438
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,639
example if they manufacture jammers if a

439
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,610
drone does not comply with this standard

440
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,640
that familiar with if they have

441
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:15,959
different frequencies different

442
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:19,650
telemetry systems another case for

443
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,110
example a drone may not have any type of

444
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:25,560
communication it can fly autonomously to

445
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:30,750
a place carries hurt and attack

446
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:33,389
in case we want to jam daps signal it

447
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:37,850
could be a drone using national systems

448
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:43,290
all that follows the roads for example

449
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:47,310
another problem is that drones are small

450
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:51,330
and agile that means that a Raider a

451
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:54,270
standard grader but usually it's four

452
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,870
planes cannot detect drones and they're

453
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:59,700
very complicated to follow the case of

454
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:02,129
racing drones world for a computer to

455
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:06,630
follow that it's impossible some of

456
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:09,900
these solutions we've seen to take down

457
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:15,380
a drone as it's been said before sending

458
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:19,320
drone using as you can see here laser to

459
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:24,770
you detect drone and should laser in

460
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,770
order to take him up take it on off more

461
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,860
specific

462
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:34,300
tracking systems using laser for example

463
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:44,060
brighter or leader which is scan through

464
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:47,629
laser here you can see some of the

465
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:53,720
devices that are currently sold this is

466
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:56,030
from DJ I had sold two as a means of

467
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,560
defense against their own drugs you

468
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,690
could put it in an area that you want to

469
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:02,270
protect they identify a drone in case

470
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,670
it's threat it tries to take it down

471
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:08,000
face that looks like a video game it's

472
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:11,900
super cool it's a gun you point it at

473
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,970
the drone and it jumps the drone to try

474
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:18,879
to take it off

475
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:24,299
some real counter measures we can see in

476
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:27,639
real life besides the ones applied in

477
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:30,250
security in iron in around the years

478
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:38,428
spoofing and GPS jamming never to

479
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:42,850
capture spy drone in this case these

480
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:46,240
jamming she make the drone lose control

481
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:48,730
and then GPS spoofing so that once

482
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,039
control is lost the drone we tried to go

483
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:54,039
back home so they changed the

484
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:59,259
coordinates and forced to land in a

485
00:29:54,039 --> 00:30:02,908
different place another counter measured

486
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:05,919
was so was against Russia and Ukraine

487
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:09,809
Russia had bought these drones to the s

488
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,809
and they were used for

489
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:17,520
in order to identify grain spaces

490
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:29,020
another countermeasure telemetry

491
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:34,480
hijacking with software and a regular TV

492
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:35,800
antenna this was used as with the

493
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,280
software called sky

494
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:43,300
Robert was connected with military drone

495
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:47,970
they could capture the video sent by the

496
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:53,430
drones to the central base and with this

497
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:55,720
Zaraki has an advantage over US missions

498
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,900
and now they come to a measure which is

499
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,270
not directly aimed at the drone it has

500
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:05,580
to do with forensics as you can see the

501
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:09,940
picture drone attacks are quite frequent

502
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:12,550
and here once a drone has been captured

503
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,130
you can carry out a forensic analysis

504
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:18,669
and in this paper which is very

505
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:21,580
interesting in a nutshell they used

506
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:25,920
drones to capture drones there was a

507
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,919
forensic analysis they could dismantle

508
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,220
trafficking network of drones used for

509
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,220
military purpose

510
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:37,519
you

511
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,919
we've shown how governments protect the

512
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,740
countries now we would like to show you

513
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:49,730
how we can protect ourselves against

514
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:53,419
this disease attacks in order to protect

515
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:57,669
yourselves against drone attacks we need

516
00:31:53,419 --> 00:32:02,750
three steps first of all detection

517
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:09,889
identification and then response so

518
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:12,590
protection for example we listen we hear

519
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:21,428
the noise of drone such as the one we've

520
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:21,428
shown before we could notified somehow

521
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:32,189
this is for DDT you can change the

522
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:34,830
formant to listen to every radio signal

523
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,320
and it costs eight hero with this we can

524
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:40,470
cover different radio frequencies such

525
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:43,830
as the ones used by drones to detect

526
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:49,230
elementary signal video signal perhaps

527
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:52,230
training with an algorithm if we I with

528
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:54,590
Douglas type of signals an alarm could

529
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,809
be sound to show that there's a drone

530
00:32:54,590 --> 00:33:00,870
another way could be using this type of

531
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:03,600
signals and to get information for

532
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:10,080
example the drone uses Wi-Fi we could

533
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:14,070
obtain the e SSID or ma c and the

534
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:17,580
warning could be launched ii didn't

535
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:20,370
identification once we know this drone

536
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:23,570
now we need to know where is it

537
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:27,299
and whether it's a threat and for this

538
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:31,530
we could use an optical sensor a camera

539
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:37,440
for example with an algorithm trained to

540
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:41,610
detect drones we don't just need to see

541
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:45,980
what the drone is but also what type of

542
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,979
tronie is noted to attack it

543
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:58,210
so now if identified the drone and what

544
00:33:52,540 --> 00:34:03,399
type of attack we can I carry out in

545
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:07,180
this case in this slide we show the

546
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,870
attacks aimed at our drone dots point

547
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:10,120
zero

548
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,609
first of all kill all will you kill

549
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,790
every active processes in the drone and

550
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:19,899
it just falls down let's see a video

551
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:24,699
later on that makes me love the second

552
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:29,020
attacked is we identified the ones that

553
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:32,109
use Wi-Fi we give the mi vendor mi C and

554
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:36,100
we if we know that this that similar

555
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:38,560
drone close to us we send packages with

556
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:41,830
this identification and the operator

557
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,679
loses the connection spoofing in this

558
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:49,509
case the drone we used doesn't have GPS

559
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:53,220
but if it does we use IP and mi see we

560
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,220
can controlled part of the drone

561
00:34:53,929 --> 00:35:01,290
in this case I round up see top series

562
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:04,200
by the protocol to connect with the

563
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:06,380
engine so wicked send a signal to the

564
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,379
end

565
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,480
the valleys and JAMA

566
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:23,870
we inhibit the apparatus I know and this

567
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:25,760
person loses control over the device so

568
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:30,850
with the second attack the

569
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:33,850
authentication here we left the vendors

570
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,850
marks

571
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:42,080
the brands that use wife and to control

572
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:47,770
drones either for video streaming or

573
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:53,090
telemetry these ones go pro parrot and

574
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:56,090
DJ I will write announcing scrape and we

575
00:35:53,090 --> 00:36:02,870
find a Mac around it we send the

576
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:09,890
authentication package we had this

577
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:12,589
little module at home and we look there

578
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:16,759
was something here it's a library I

579
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:21,250
encourage you to use it and to see how

580
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:26,060
it's Wi-Fi protocol works in this case

581
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:28,550
with this library will occur no doubt

582
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:31,310
the authentication of the operator and

583
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:32,870
his device and I will then I'm going to

584
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:35,330
show you this with a video it's not top

585
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:43,900
quality but the operators flying the

586
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:47,180
drone we see the app this is the DMS you

587
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:49,670
jus the library we've shown is directly

588
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,879
controlled with the other phone with

589
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,810
seen a signal that the operator is

590
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,910
getting

591
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:05,790
he loses the connection above the drones

592
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:10,890
resignation it stays still there now the

593
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:12,509
connection has been lost and we are

594
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,640
controlling the connection with the

595
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:17,520
computer now we're going to control the

596
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:22,400
drone with the computer I apologize for

597
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:28,130
the quality their colleagues around

598
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,130
flying with the keyboard is not easy

599
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:37,590
we've shown a toy drone a simple one but

600
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:40,030
now we want to see what happens with

601
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:43,050
certain speak real-life drones the one

602
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:48,280
to see in the streets the ones that can

603
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:51,330
lift two kilograms the first attack that

604
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,010
we came up with and which has been used

605
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:57,400
there was there wasn't pictures

606
00:37:54,010 --> 00:38:01,650
published yesterday the Turkish army

607
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,820
instead of machine guns the work car not

608
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:11,020
guns in order to protect themselves

609
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:12,880
against drones in this case we use

610
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:17,290
damage we can measure any frequency we

611
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:24,910
want to 3G 4G GPS Wi-Fi in our case we

612
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:29,009
used hack RF one will send the noise to

613
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:31,899
the drone and we make it lose its idly

614
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:37,540
regarding GPS spoofing it works 100%

615
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:40,360
nowadays in this case this is how GPS

616
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,310
works the device wants to know its

617
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,560
location it contacts different

618
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:46,810
satellites it's estimated delay with the

619
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,210
different satellites and it estimates

620
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:50,650
the exact position I'm not going to get

621
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,070
into detail because we're running out of

622
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:56,680
time we wanted to replicate his attack

623
00:38:54,070 --> 00:39:02,350
based on this library which I highly

624
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:05,770
encourage after buying all the materials

625
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:07,870
we did it with with read lots of

626
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,930
documentation it didn't work what was

627
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:16,359
the problem we need a highly precise

628
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:19,690
clock to correct the deviation the hack

629
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:22,630
RF is not giving you

630
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:26,880
so let's give the technical part we

631
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:29,319
carried out the dear PS poofing intact

632
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,210
we were telling the drum you're flying

633
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:35,910
in Madrid and we want to send you to

634
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:39,280
Ukraine when it to falsify the position

635
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:42,640
we can change the world and we can say

636
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,299
what to which part we wanted to go this

637
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,299
is the attack

638
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:53,770
the coordinates are from cuenca this is

639
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:59,380
an homage to teacher we had who always

640
00:39:53,770 --> 00:40:02,890
always begin about cuenca this this is

641
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:06,310
what we've seen in the first slides we

642
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:09,040
see the drone doesn't have courage we

643
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,080
were in Madrid I can guarantee that

644
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,119
there was a closed this was a closed

645
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:20,109
environment here we have the GPS antenna

646
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:24,580
the clock I've mentioned it's here in

647
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:29,520
case you want to ask anything we check

648
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:29,520
that it's cuenca we launched the script

649
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:44,589
here we can see that the mobile device

650
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:48,820
is receiving satellites which are not

651
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:54,750
the ones it should receive we use even a

652
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:54,750
GPS watch to receive the new GPS I

653
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,890
apologize

654
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:17,009
we see that the watch has received

655
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:19,839
Congress's coordinates we see that the

656
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:24,490
phone connected through a coin has

657
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:28,480
coordinates and the drone has connected

658
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:34,118
through Poincare coordinates you please

659
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:37,800
fast forward a little bit we show the

660
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:37,800
drones that you can see it's real

661
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,820
next attack

662
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:54,839
the next countermeasure would be

663
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:58,720
telemetry hijacking it's about capturing

664
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:03,610
telemetry and if we can send telemetry

665
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,470
to the drone it depends on the

666
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:11,590
manufacturer and the telemetry system

667
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:17,080
it's using in our case it was a 433

668
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:19,200
megahertz radio and when the one of the

669
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:23,279
computer and the one on board are

670
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:26,350
synchronized they are assigned an ID and

671
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:34,060
once this ID is established it ignores

672
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:40,330
any other ID we modify the code so that

673
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:42,640
it ignores the ID and can respond so

674
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:46,060
that it can receive and send information

675
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,720
to on any ID in this way we can connect

676
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:55,570
to any drone that's flying and has this

677
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:58,359
system on board what can we do we can

678
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:02,400
send commands the drone we can cancel

679
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:04,900
control over the by the user we can send

680
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,140
the drone into missions or if it's

681
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:14,790
flying we can disable it them in the

682
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:14,790
flight so it falls down this is demo

683
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:26,460
in this case you can see that the vid is

684
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:34,740
here flying his drone with very bad

685
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:38,369
intentions you can hear the engine where

686
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:40,560
he's playing with the controls and you

687
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:44,880
see the engine is working but it has no

688
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:47,190
wings oh it's on the ground the dock has

689
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,359
taken place and he doesn't have control

690
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:59,970
over the drone anymore the mission sent

691
00:43:51,359 --> 00:44:01,980
is to be lifted one meter above this is

692
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,259
the end of the mission this is the end

693
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:08,609
of the script and the user receives

694
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:11,880
control a back if a drone is coming to

695
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:14,869
us we remove control and we make it land

696
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,869
in a protected area

697
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,069
if we combine all these and tags

698
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:34,270
security uses system such as this one

699
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:44,390
this is the anti drone system we've

700
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:46,750
created it's homemade completely

701
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,750
homemade

702
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:56,150
there's an antenna for jamming this

703
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:59,690
antenna here for detection in 2.4

704
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:05,720
gigahertz using the radio we can detect

705
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:08,180
sigh knows we have hack RF for GPS

706
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:11,000
spoofing and a camera to the type drone

707
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:14,779
in case it's present so that we can

708
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,690
identify it and we have the electronics

709
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:25,760
to control these because this can move

710
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:30,370
upwards downwards etc these are two

711
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:33,530
attacks one with this drone here and

712
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:37,960
another one with this other drone we

713
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,960
didn't take it we didn't bring it

714
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:48,510
we're in the countryside this is our

715
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:50,910
drone flying against the area

716
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:53,040
here you can see the drone has been

717
00:45:50,910 --> 00:46:02,100
detected it's trying to connect to

718
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:05,279
telemetry telemetry as connected as

719
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:08,660
sending something send it a mission the

720
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,420
mission is flying to save height and

721
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:14,399
land in GPS coordinates we've sent as

722
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:18,540
you can see I've lost control over the

723
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:21,200
drone a bit scared because I'm afraid

724
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,200
that it will fall down

725
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:40,610
and this way we could avoid the attack

726
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:44,618
we've shown before next one this is AR

727
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:44,619
Drone which is the cooler

728
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:57,610
this is what the drone is seeing where

729
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:59,630
there here we detect the drone is there

730
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:04,240
with the better camera it would be

731
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:04,240
better detected the attack has been sent

732
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:17,700
once it has fallen down what forensic

733
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:26,040
information can we get from these

734
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:28,290
devices in this case we share what the

735
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,870
problems the different things they do

736
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:35,880
and this is the log that would show us

737
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:39,299
what we could do next we see the

738
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:44,490
matching date with matching with the

739
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:50,150
first device then our as I D and the

740
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:56,729
release day it uses new the device was

741
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:59,610
md5 of mark this is important and the

742
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:03,180
last flies flight has taken place are

743
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:04,250
you familiar with what driving if you're

744
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:08,210
very lucky

745
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:12,720
perhaps the SSID can be uploaded into

746
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:15,570
wickel and it gives you an approximate

747
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:19,919
area around which the operator has been

748
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:21,750
flying many drones into different

749
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:28,160
controllers there are different brands

750
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:32,120
and models some of the most widely known

751
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:37,399
these but these are this software

752
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:40,430
in our case our drone uses autopilot and

753
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:44,660
will try to carry out forensic analysis

754
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:47,690
it's as simple as connecting the drone

755
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,730
through a USB and using the tools we

756
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:52,370
have at the drone we can download the

757
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:54,860
log you see all the flights there are 12

758
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:58,160
logs and in the case of drone doesn't

759
00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:04,820
work you just need to carry it cheap

760
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:08,540
after it the memory directly this is an

761
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:10,700
example of one of our logs it's open we

762
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:15,020
can see the fan were release the

763
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:21,140
coordinates altitude flight mode whether

764
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:26,300
it was automatic or manual and the files

765
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:30,200
we get and dot painting docked XT these

766
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:31,670
are used by the tool for this controller

767
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:36,410
which is mission planner we can open

768
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:38,980
them and replicate recreate the flight

769
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:41,980
with graphics

770
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,260
we'll see we see here the history of

771
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:50,680
fortitude

772
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:54,250
we could also recreate flights all the

773
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:56,440
flights here in blue you have one flight

774
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,780
and green another one and read another

775
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:02,920
one

776
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:06,390
if we go back yeah you could see that

777
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:12,940
I've had been flying in different areas

778
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:18,368
about other controllers we have the ones

779
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:23,950
with paparazzi firmware we can extract

780
00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:26,560
the logs and use tools to view the px4

781
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:29,890
which is a miniature pilot we can

782
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:33,040
download all the logs and view them

783
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:36,430
using its tools the case of bit of light

784
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:41,410
it can be connected to the console and

785
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:44,828
stored and we can recover the logs there

786
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:48,790
are some interesting tools I found in

787
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:52,630
the case of inner and others but logs

788
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:55,930
sometimes in binary code we cannot read

789
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:59,410
them directly this with this program you

790
00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:02,230
can create a CSV file

791
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:09,640
or you can even recreate the flight

792
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:13,820
using a map about generic drones the

793
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:15,569
ones you can buy in the market

794
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:19,839
[Music]

795
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:23,769
wicked analyzed their mobile app DJI has

796
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:25,449
its own application in the application

797
00:51:23,769 --> 00:51:28,988
we could obtain information such as

798
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:35,979
accounts uploaded files use of files

799
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:40,869
erased files logs even login tokens in

800
00:51:35,979 --> 00:51:42,218
order to connect to the cloud well we

801
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:45,429
can get information about login and

802
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:48,909
password not just DJI this is for many

803
00:51:45,429 --> 00:51:52,929
different brands in the case they have

804
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:55,809
cloud and we obtained the login token we

805
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:58,949
can obtain information from the account

806
00:51:55,809 --> 00:52:01,989
the drones registered by that's you sir

807
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:05,859
flight histories and we can even

808
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:09,849
download pictures and videos vectors and

809
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:14,558
videos using software they could be used

810
00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:18,249
to recreate the flights this drone has

811
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:21,249
made the drone itself it has and has the

812
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:22,888
memory construct pictures and videos

813
00:52:21,249 --> 00:52:26,759
stored in it

814
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:30,759
many of them have flight logs the

815
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:35,559
internal memory itself both through

816
00:52:30,759 --> 00:52:38,829
physical extraction or tip-off and in

817
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:42,459
the case of DJI we can obtain a file

818
00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:45,570
which is dat but the history of every

819
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:50,460
GPS coordinate

820
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:50,460
we can more or less recreative light

821
00:52:52,560 --> 00:53:00,790
well this is everything I wouldn't want

822
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:03,250
you to create homemade drones with bombs

823
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:08,050
we just wanted to show you that these

824
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:11,790
things are quite accessible both from an

825
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,790
attacking and a defensive point of view

826
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:24,380
