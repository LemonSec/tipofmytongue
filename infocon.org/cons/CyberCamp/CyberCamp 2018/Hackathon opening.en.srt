2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,570
bueno en primer lugar wanna do a todos

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:19,740
muchisimas gracias por fight let me

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:23,050
start with a word of thanks I want to

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,490
thank you for coming and you know that

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:30,189
this is our fifth edition of hackathon

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:33,190
which has been a real success not just

8
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:35,829
from the quantitative point of view the

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,019
number of people who've entered but also

10
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:40,540
because of the quality of the projects

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,039
so I just wanted to mention it and thank

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:50,500
you once again but now we're going to

13
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:52,840
get started Buenos Aires is nothing new

14
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,109
here was interested we're going to start

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,899
with a short presentation the idea is

16
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:01,899
that we want to hear from you and who've

17
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:04,330
entered the hackathon we want to hear

18
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:06,790
about your projects and we will tell you

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,470
about the teams a little bit about the

20
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:13,780
members of the jury the times and

21
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:18,009
logistics we all know what a hackathon

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:22,600
is what Y is our hackathon different

23
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:25,960
well because every project every team is

24
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,270
completely free deciding what they want

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,710
to do if they want to improve an

26
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:36,939
existing project or something completely

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:39,460
new supposedly if we can last air we're

28
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:44,039
going to be here for three days and the

29
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:48,039
idea is that projects won't finish here

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,130
but rather they can be submitted again

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,539
in future editions to be further

32
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:58,280
improved and hopefully in that way we

33
00:01:55,539 --> 00:02:04,229
can disseminate and

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,399
Fausta local talent these are our

35
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,330
members of the jury

36
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:16,519
starting with Oscar Garcia and bathin

37
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:21,959
death I don't know if the sound is a bit

38
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:25,170
echoey anyway let's continue with the

39
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,010
members of the jury Danny Garcia and

40
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:32,250
Jose selfie they're going to be checking

41
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:35,760
the code that you program and Raul and

42
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:39,140
myself Monica as well what many of you

43
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:44,790
know my name I placed there because of

44
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:47,640
telegram because of our messages so you

45
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:52,109
know that we've given you a hexadecimal

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:56,548
code to identify your team that will

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:59,549
help a anonymize scoring so that they're

48
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:02,040
landmarks and landmark one or two we

49
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:04,650
will never see in the name of the team

50
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,470
we won't be able to identify which team

51
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:16,880
the code belongs to and we will just see

52
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:20,459
the code we're not going to be giving

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,440
transparently in the scoring and really

54
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,390
we think is best at least in the initial

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,440
stages because there will be very little

56
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,569
very few differences in team scores at

57
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,640
the beginning the main point at the

58
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:38,369
beginning of the hackathon is your

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,790
explanations it's at the moment at the

60
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,450
beginning we don't have any code that

61
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,209
you have prepared previously so the idea

62
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:51,250
is that at the beginning the jury will

63
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:57,520
have to assess the

64
00:03:51,250 --> 00:04:02,560
how functional what do you provide is

65
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:05,950
and we will mostly be valuing how

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,850
innovative and original your proposal is

67
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:12,640
how complex it is from a technical point

68
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,720
of view the quality of the presentations

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,149
were as I said at the beginning

70
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,640
initially your explanations your

71
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:24,669
presentation of what you're doing it

72
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:28,330
will be most important and last but not

73
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:32,789
least how it will be important for you

74
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:37,169
to ask other teams questions and also to

75
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:40,240
reply to questions that are asked to you

76
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:42,280
conveniently please remember that in the

77
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,360
questions you ask and in your replies

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,549
that will be scoring points or not the

79
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,470
idea is that this is very collaborative

80
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:56,229
that this is an open-source community

81
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:59,530
and that there is interaction and

82
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:05,560
feedback let me just remind you that you

83
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:08,799
have also selected a code randomly like

84
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:12,210
pulling it out of a hat and that's what

85
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,370
decides who's going to be presenting

86
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,890
projects first and last and then the

87
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,490
idea is that at the end of the process

88
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:25,360
the order will be immersed and we will

89
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,729
reverse the order just as a reminder you

90
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,860
have the hexadecimal code

91
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:32,950
remember that you have to keep that one

92
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,880
secret because it identifies your team

93
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:42,000
and then from 1 to 10 just saying who

94
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:48,640
will be intervening first and last right

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:52,090
here we have a fever Spartan or Theon

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:56,080
Spartan sorry first what you can see up

97
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,419
on the screen allies will be third up

98
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,010
like sorry

99
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,799
anyway this table is just a reminder of

100
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,050
how you need to introduce yourselves and

101
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,260
that's enough from us we're ready to

102
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,810
start the hackathon but before we do so

103
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,449
we're going to do something special this

104
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:18,310
year something different we want to pay

105
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:21,340
tribute to people who have been very

106
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:26,550
involved in hackathon to death really

107
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:29,979
there they stand for best efforts for

108
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,169
devotion to hackathon and I'm not going

109
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,330
to tell you who they are but I will give

110
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:37,359
you a good clue they come from Alpha

111
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:40,599
Theta in Eastern Spain and what do they

112
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,630
do to come here from they catch a train

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,389
as soon as they get here they go mad

114
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:49,150
about their keyboards here we have them

115
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:53,620
are four so they got the New Year MO and

116
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:57,070
her man who have been champions in three

117
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,070
years running I'm pretty sure that they

118
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,380
want to make this year their fourth

119
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,440
award so a warm round of applause for

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:08,979
all of them they really deserve it

121
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:13,360
welcome one more year so who else is

122
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:19,300
going to be here this year who was the

123
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:23,979
winner of the Dubai hackathon in 2017

124
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:27,180
then the i/o tech group one of their

125
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:30,340
members who came second last year and

126
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,470
cyber watcher here we have two members

127
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,210
of the team right now the third one will

128
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,349
be joining us later today they got a

129
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,590
very good score last year so this year

130
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:46,680
is going to be a truly epic experience

131
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,679
or the best for you break a leg or two

132
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:58,268
para para que lo tengas Claro let me

133
00:07:54,069 --> 00:08:02,469
just clarify something whoever wins this

134
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:05,769
hackathon will be will go down in

135
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:10,779
history for this it will either be our

136
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:13,360
usual team with their fourth win or it

137
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:17,649
will be somebody who will wipe them off

138
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:22,899
the face of the earth so we're going to

139
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:26,229
start with presentations I think the

140
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:28,779
presentations have been loaded on this

141
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:32,468
computer so that we can show it up on

142
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:35,229
the screen there is a folder for each

143
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,539
team you can just click on it and you

144
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:41,110
can access your presentation straight

145
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:43,629
away las preguntas por terrific are low

146
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:49,170
no intranet loss ah let me just clarify

147
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:51,850
something the Q&A session is not

148
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:55,329
included in the six minutes that you've

149
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:58,329
been given so you all have the same time

150
00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:01,660
for presentations and then if there's

151
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:03,638
time here we will do a Q&A session here

152
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,199
otherwise we can go into the hackathon

153
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:11,800
room and ask and answer questions

154
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:16,000
questions from other members of other

155
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,819
teams and from members of the jury so

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:29,290
can we start with Theon Spartans

157
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:32,559
their first initial micron a Mesa let me

158
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:37,660
remind you that you've course this mic

159
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:40,930
here plus the robing mic and you've also

160
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,709
got your control here for clicking on

161
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,709
the presentation

162
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,990
when a winner had told us good morning

163
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,630
everyone we are first and there's a

164
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:08,290
defibrillator outside I was very glad to

165
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:12,160
see it just in case with Theo Spartans

166
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:16,270
and here we are with Waldo at 2:00 for

167
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,839
detection and Prevention of attacks with

168
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:22,840
thoughts that fatal one was not

169
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,620
distributed and we thought well why not

170
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,750
do that we decided that was a good idea

171
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,980
in the end that we could add more

172
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:35,770
functionalities for this special tool

173
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,680
the idea would be having it all

174
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:42,220
centralized somewhere it might be a LK

175
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:45,969
now and then the checking interactions

176
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,640
on the logos seeing how many people try

177
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:53,740
to access on the logs sorry

178
00:10:48,640 --> 00:11:01,180
and then scoring on the IP and then

179
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:05,280
depending on that sending alerts or the

180
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:09,849
idea is that all nodes will provide

181
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:12,699
information and it will happen on all

182
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,070
nodes without depending whether you

183
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,240
block them or not

184
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,830
right I would like to tell you a little

185
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,050
bit about the technologies that we're

186
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:27,100
going to be using docker Python and

187
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:29,979
MongoDB and blk with docker we will have

188
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:32,530
we will raise the infrastructure we will

189
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,080
have the containers and then the

190
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:37,870
programming language will be Python

191
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,360
because it's one of the most popular

192
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,940
ones and because of that it has all

193
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:47,560
these libraries that will be very

194
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:51,970
helpful for Python connections for the

195
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:55,000
ALK for queries for insertions

196
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:59,050
Python has then these libraries that

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,840
allow for connections between Python and

198
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:05,349
MongoDB those interactions will be

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:09,320
further enhanced about the database err

200
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:11,750
we decided to use a non SQL

201
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,260
go DB and we decided to use us because

202
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,540
the information we will be handling it

203
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,939
won't be many tables they won't have

204
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:23,689
ratios and we didn't want to use really

205
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:27,410
a SQL databases and because all the logs

206
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:31,270
need to be centralized and because we

207
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:34,730
want a program that is a standalone

208
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:36,650
because blk is the most popular one we

209
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:41,600
thought that would be good for our Waldo

210
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:43,520
application we would like to show you

211
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,430
the infrastructure now and tell you

212
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,860
about the interaction this is what we

213
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:53,689
want to develop with three virtual

214
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:56,990
machines using it for tests the machines

215
00:12:53,690 --> 00:13:00,350
will be sending the logs to Asti and

216
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,470
then from the Python container you can

217
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:07,130
see that that is all with docker and

218
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:11,090
docker compost because we want the

219
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:14,480
application to be easily implemented not

220
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:17,930
just for very technical users but more

221
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:24,490
generally speaking so the Python

222
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:26,689
container will check the I still search

223
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,520
elasticsearch sorry and then that

224
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:34,460
information will be set would be saved

225
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:37,010
on the database for queries for scoring

226
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:40,010
the idea is that we would then check

227
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:43,010
their score and execute the actions

228
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:45,530
sending the commands to the machines or

229
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:48,439
later maybe if there is a viable work

230
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:52,579
the rules the ratios would be sent to

231
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,570
the firewall last but not least we would

232
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:58,520
like to tell you what we want to develop

233
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,670
here compared with the infrastructure

234
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:06,380
that we had previously what did we bring

235
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:09,050
the docker composed parts that will lift

236
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,960
the infrastructure and from the SSH

237
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,959
connections and from the fight to one

238
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:19,880
logs and that's what we would be working

239
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:21,519
with initially the secure allowed the

240
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:28,600
out load

241
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:32,559
the failed to band and then from the LK

242
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:36,579
start all the queries of the logs not

243
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:38,709
there we had to get the information then

244
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:42,279
we also want to check the part lists

245
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:47,079
because we want to check up against the

246
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:50,679
API we have the IP and we want to see it

247
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:53,769
as a reported malicious a IP if it had

248
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:56,230
been reported by a previous user whoops

249
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,089
the mic is not working properly no well

250
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,660
that would have a greater weight for

251
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:05,290
scoring which is the main part of our

252
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:07,749
project because the scores will tell us

253
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:11,740
at which actions need to be determined

254
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:13,269
so in MongoDB once we have VIPs a we

255
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:17,529
would have the schools there and

256
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:19,809
depending on the points well if they're

257
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:23,470
very high we will have more restricted

258
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:27,389
panning I whereas if they're lower then

259
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:30,670
we might go for one hour or two hour

260
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:33,879
running so if we have panned for

261
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:36,790
instance an IP for an hour and we see

262
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:39,129
there's no repetition no a iteration

263
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,379
then we need to lower the score and

264
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:43,660
that's how we decide which measures need

265
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:46,839
to be taken and this is the last part of

266
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:50,860
our project it has to do with the

267
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:53,259
measures to be taken in water whether it

268
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,139
is burning or deepening from the

269
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:58,119
different nodes so that's it that's our

270
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:00,070
presentation for our project thank you

271
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:05,639
for your attention

272
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:05,639
[Applause]

273
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:17,209
no windows oh wow they had two seconds

274
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:20,029
still to spare that's pretty pretty good

275
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:22,130
timing if you ask me we're going to now

276
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:25,610
hear from the second team and we'll

277
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:27,950
leave questions for last that's true I

278
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,740
forgot to mention it during the initial

279
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:33,140
introduction if you have a pen and paper

280
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:36,829
it might be a good idea for you to take

281
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,149
down notes for questions to be asked if

282
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,779
you need pen and paper please

283
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:40,779
just let me know

284
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,510
when when Oh si si todos good morning

285
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,270
everyone

286
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:05,119
we are cyber water that's the name of

287
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:07,700
our team and there's there are two of us

288
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,429
at the moment Xavier Omega lock help

289
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,620
myself and then Sun T will be joining us

290
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:17,900
a little bit later this is our project s

291
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:25,629
soap this is a platform and that will be

292
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:25,630
an auditor authentication service

293
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:37,340
our soft soap a application we work with

294
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:41,559
three different elements a mobile

295
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:45,649
terminal coping and biometrics

296
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:50,600
so let's start with the problems that we

297
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:54,529
want to overcome with this - firstly the

298
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:58,730
problem with storage doing away with all

299
00:17:54,529 --> 00:18:00,799
those plastic cards that really have the

300
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:05,690
same information whether it is your

301
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:10,010
credit card your bus card or parking

302
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:13,039
card they all have the same details at

303
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,020
the end of the day because currently

304
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,500
there are systems in applications that

305
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:21,620
have already solved that part that side

306
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:23,450
of things so that the details are saved

307
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:27,080
on the mobile phone on your mobile phone

308
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:29,679
but what happens when we lose our mobile

309
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:36,199
phone will lose all that information our

310
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:40,669
innovation is having a tool which as

311
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:45,230
mega lung cell said it will provide a

312
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:48,049
soap integration in any platform any

313
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:51,159
platform through an API that is

314
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:55,490
providing a service that will connect

315
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:57,620
automatically with our platform so that

316
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:02,390
we can then offer three levels of

317
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:07,639
service and where the user gives us a

318
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:12,140
pattern or a pin number and then we

319
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:16,549
would be sending a bus a ID or an SMS

320
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:18,559
text message or through pushed

321
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:23,200
certification then with those

322
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,200
credentials from authentication

323
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:31,700
we would double-check illogically and

324
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:35,749
then we would give we would make sure

325
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:39,559
then that we have securely identified

326
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:41,929
that individual and they say that they

327
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,259
are who they say they are and we can

328
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:49,149
send them their details again why so

329
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:52,609
that users can access that information

330
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:56,178
for instance you want to shop on Amazon

331
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:59,960
well you just need a PIN number your

332
00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:03,559
print and you can access your

333
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,169
fingerprints and then you can access you

334
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,389
can go ahead and do your shopping well

335
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:13,629
we have done some benchmarking for

336
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:20,019
instance we have checked a mobile app

337
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:22,879
yotie I believe he said for credit card

338
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:26,470
information any sensitive information

339
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:30,498
that's already there that application

340
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:32,989
stores those details internally on your

341
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:35,090
mobile phone can you imagine when you

342
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:38,570
lose your mobile phone well you've lost

343
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:42,199
it all we want to centralize all that

344
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:45,549
information so that users can follow

345
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:48,559
those three simple steps and

346
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:49,039
authenticate their details whenever

347
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,649
needed

348
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,559
who's our target audience well it could

349
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:58,090
be private individuals banks governments

350
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:02,779
anybody who wants a secure system for

351
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:05,299
authentication so what's the current

352
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:13,090
situation how far have we come

353
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:13,090
well we have done biometrics encrypting

354
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:23,928
certificates but it's very very

355
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:27,019
superficial and study only last night we

356
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:31,159
heard that somebody has been studying a

357
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:34,129
library for fingerprinting digital

358
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,989
fingerprinting authentication and we

359
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:38,310
thought hey that could be a very good

360
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:40,650
starting point for our project

361
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:43,320
that's when we decided that we want to

362
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:46,230
investigate it further so that we can

363
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:51,720
further develop his oh and I forgot to

364
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:54,390
mention earlier that the idea is we will

365
00:21:51,720 --> 00:22:01,890
be organize our data system in a

366
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:05,850
certified manner so that we won't have

367
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:08,490
anybody saving information for whoever

368
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:10,850
logically we have to make sure and

369
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,720
validate that that's right we need

370
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:17,909
certification right we know how code

371
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,540
will be developed this is our schedule

372
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:23,760
our timeline as soon as Santi joins as

373
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,740
this afternoon we will continue with our

374
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,530
next development thank you very much for

375
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:30,740
your attention

376
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,740
[Applause]

377
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:20,620
que pase el cuarto keepo right we want

378
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,000
to now hear from the fourth team because

379
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:28,928
there's a little bit of a problem with

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:31,990
their presentation which is going to

381
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:34,870
solve this technical problem for this

382
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:40,770
third team so we will continue with the

383
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:40,770
fourth team security in the meantime

384
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,829

385
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:20,770
as guests everyone on board appointed

386
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:20,770
company obrigada

widow Widow duplicate la pantalla lugar

388
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:42,379
distended maid mirrored the screen

389
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,380
instead of expanding it

390
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:53,889
about myself a little

391
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,570
hola

392
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,330
so we are the team introducing

393
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,450
intelligent security and it's not so

394
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:29,310
much a tool as it is a service as we

395
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:32,320
devised it and we thought of it as a

396
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:33,100
security management and monitoring for

397
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,070
SMEs

398
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:39,580
I think it's to wider scope so let me

399
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:42,399
specify what it really means so what

400
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:46,240
about the team members it's three of us

401
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,300
that's have a that's him and he is a

402
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,600
cyber security analyst for Deloitte and

403
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:55,389
he is a developer as well and Lukas who

404
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,510
is the one on the left side and he works

405
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,460
as a CDO telefonica as our researcher

406
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:03,129
and developer as Rahm and myself

407
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,230
Santiago working at cyber sock as an

408
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:11,710
analyst although I'm a bit more focused

409
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:15,430
on strategy and succs training etc so

410
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:18,730
our system our surface was devised as a

411
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:21,430
service with a set of capabilities by

412
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:23,620
means of which a company or some people

413
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:26,770
who do not have advanced knowledge on

414
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,649
cyber security team on nature stay up to

415
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:32,980
date on the cyber security ecosystem

416
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:34,660
within their organization with saw David

417
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,780
as a service with different capabilities

418
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:40,090
such as security intelligence that would

419
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,670
be fine in domains that I have been

420
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:46,990
neglected for the company or pace beans

421
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:49,360
and also passwords or any leaks within

422
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,670
the company so everything having to do

423
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,010
with threat intelligence there are other

424
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:56,950
capabilities such as threat hunting

425
00:26:54,010 --> 00:27:00,879
where we can gather different events and

426
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:02,740
logs from operating systems and taken

427
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,700
them to a central repository such as

428
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,520
date Lane or using correlations as well

429
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,190
and also producing a series of warnings

430
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,550
or alerts so that a given person can see

431
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,950
this real-time without advanced cyber

432
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,780
security technical knowledge and that

433
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,890
way they will get a general idea of

434
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,410
what's going on with

435
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,450
the company and then I guess what's made

436
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:28,120
in the difference here between the way

437
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:30,940
that someone who might not know how to

438
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,219
use a hands ed or security program still

439
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,679
they can interact with it all and learn

440
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:39,760
what's going on and so we added the

441
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:43,179
smart sistent where what we won't ask

442
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,429
you interact if there's a threat or

443
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:48,040
anything else that using your voice or

444
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:50,049
your cell phone so you can have virtual

445
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,850
assistants same as a Google home or

446
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:56,230
things of that kind

447
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:58,600
so this is an idea that came up well

448
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:03,340
from different approaches first of all

449
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:05,918
the personal experience is before

450
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,689
working at our current companies we've

451
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,600
always been working with a smaller

452
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,330
companies under security and we realized

453
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,490
that most of those are impacted by

454
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:19,928
security breaches which are quite basic

455
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:21,790
and that can be easily sold it out and

456
00:28:19,929 --> 00:28:23,980
oftentimes they are not sorted out

457
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:28,000
because they find there's a lack of

458
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:29,740
resources or only a few bunch of emperor

459
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,660
years who are save their security

460
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,640
experts and I think if we call it a bit

461
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,980
of a more independent system we could

462
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,500
monitor it all and allow those people to

463
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:41,919
be aware of what's going on in problems

464
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,780
that might arise so basically the

465
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:48,340
specific target of our service would be

466
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:52,210
s means still it could be extended to

467
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:55,600
other organizations just by following a

468
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:59,580
series of changes so for my explanation

469
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,580
and my colleague will pick it up now

470
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:14,159
so the idea is to have a tool so where

471
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:17,610
small companies can interact with

472
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:22,980
cybersecurity data so this is a sim

473
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:26,340
evolution first back and where we've got

474
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,650
the data infrastructure then we have a

475
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,320
back-end and the dates the lake and all

476
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:36,559
having to do with a warnings and alerts

477
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:39,120
and then the mo vine app as a front-end

478
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:43,620
here we see the structure of our

479
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,139
back-end right now we've chosen seem

480
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,969
what Splunk actually probably know about

481
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,890
that otherwise you will hear about it

482
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:53,040
throughout the presentations still the

483
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:55,860
final goal would be using a princess

484
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,990
system as a search but because of our

485
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,939
team we thought that for three days it

486
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,790
would be easier to use a system we're

487
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,390
all familiar with the backend will be

488
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:08,549
using Python which is flask now out of

489
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,470
the beta version so that's good news for

490
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:13,080
everyone

491
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:15,240
that will use an API to interact with

492
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,850
the front-end and other services and

493
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,710
then we will have kind of a virtual

494
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,600
infrastructure on Amazon Web service

495
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,210
that will be kind of a company with

496
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:29,189
several servers and machines and then

497
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:31,440
with you as query will produce the whole

498
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:36,270
structure of services and processes and

499
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:40,650
then I need to state a link and then my

500
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:44,460
colleague will explain we also have a

501
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:46,650
mobile a PP quite simple and Chris

502
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,990
appear so that everyone can use it and

503
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:53,760
then a virtual assistant that will

504
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:58,010
replicate information and will run as an

505
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,010
interaction on top of everything else

506
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:06,850
there is a communication system yes my

507
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,940
colleague just explained which allows

508
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:13,480
for a proper interaction this is all

509
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,760
part of innovation and so we have some

510
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,460
clear features we have an interface with

511
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,790
SMEs and the difference between a

512
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:23,560
regular seem and our project would be

513
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:26,320
that a regular ordinary person can use

514
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,659
our app and has real events and can

515
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,909
manage every company with our in-depth

516
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,160
knowledge and a Swiss set there's

517
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:37,030
nothing out there similar to what we

518
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,350
have we called some novelties and in the

519
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:48,490
end you need to have the technical

520
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:50,350
expertise in order to use them yeah so

521
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,910
father our roadmap is oh thank you very

522
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,559
much

523
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,559
[Applause]

524
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:10,970
see so so much a notional Marcin nada de

525
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:13,750
nos a trattoria premier espero courser

526
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:16,720
Cousteau's in el tiempo que tenemos que

527
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:19,400
hasta robotic a Shuba Alex

528
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,230
principio de Austin so let's have applix

529
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,230
up here in Jabberwocky

530
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:35,489
I mentioned okay lock open

531
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:39,720
all I wanna have over the organization

532
00:33:35,669 --> 00:33:44,129
it monoamine hombre

533
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:46,519
I'm role here stunning and we are

534
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:48,539
actually three team members but our

535
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:50,429
colleague could not make it

536
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:55,019
natalia could not make it she will join

537
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:59,220
us later today this is our teams and

538
00:33:55,019 --> 00:34:01,559
projects named Alex Authenticator just

539
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:06,350
low energy external that Raveena's

540
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:10,168
fantasy so the idea would be to simplify

541
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:12,629
login on two sets in a secured wait so

542
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:15,929
by using a blixt we would need not need

543
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:19,078
to enter a password into any device so

544
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:22,260
it would be easier and faster for all

545
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:25,429
users to lock into the same device

546
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:30,859
without years and different accounts

547
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:35,220
anabolics includes directory file read

548
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:37,889
management so any user using a vlocks

549
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,049
will have on the device all the files

550
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:42,569
that belong to them without a personal

551
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:46,560
account because this is a cloud service

552
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:51,540
and it is scalable so it can be used on

553
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:55,109
a home computer SME or even a larger

554
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,819
company but how does it work my

555
00:34:55,109 --> 00:35:03,390
colleague is about to explain it to you

556
00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:07,410
so this is the architecture that we

557
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:10,319
mintee developed for our project so we

558
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:15,328
have 4 access here basic access first

559
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:19,050
one a token which is BL a small device

560
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:23,480
with a micro driver then is easy to use

561
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:26,400
for the user and it has all the identity

562
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,109
elements with everything that is needed

563
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,940
for the user and there's the one that

564
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:33,960
would walk so to say it's you the

565
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:35,790
computer through the PC of the user so

566
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,390
it does by having your token with you

567
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:43,170
with list degree of interaction the user

568
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:45,910
would get authenticated fast and

569
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:50,079
in a reliable way just by pushing a

570
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:52,660
button or just chosen a number or maybe

571
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,009
adding a second factor element of

572
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:56,649
authentication but a simple one's

573
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:59,559
straightforward and then that user

574
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:02,160
computer would then lock on to the cloud

575
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:06,809
service or the server I'll explain that

576
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:10,930
but the idea is that all the information

577
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:13,619
is encrypted through it it would be kind

578
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:17,009
of middleman but without too much

579
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:20,289
operations and so we avoid attacks on it

580
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:23,170
then the server is thus transferred here

581
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:25,720
this is a reliable server that is the

582
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:28,990
one in charge of everything about

583
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,058
cryptography and so identifying that is

584
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:36,729
whether the user is who they claim to be

585
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:39,329
so the server would send a challenge

586
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:42,869
let's call it a challenge to the user

587
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:45,160
using public key Oxley and xiri

588
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:48,190
cryptography and the user would need to

589
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,990
reply it back and there the registry

590
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:53,140
would happen and the identity would be

591
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:56,500
checked and then we have the file system

592
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:59,250
probably cloud based and the server is

593
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:02,470
the one reporting back to the system and

594
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:04,630
explaining what the user has ID has been

595
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,209
identified and then declared back to the

596
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:11,440
BC explaining that the authentication

597
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:13,509
has been completed on the computer it

598
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,990
would be all transparent such a saying

599
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:19,930
and you wouldn't seem matter of these

600
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:22,750
operations and then on the server you

601
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:26,589
can try and add some kind of hard word

602
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:29,650
security module making sure that all

603
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:32,049
cryptographic actions are performed in a

604
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:37,059
secure way also preventing potential

605
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:40,269
attacks on the server so what are we

606
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:43,359
going to use in order to carry out the

607
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:46,569
project as Danny said we will be using a

608
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:50,069
micro driver based structure we will be

609
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:55,400
using one by Nordic semiconductors and

610
00:37:50,069 --> 00:38:00,980
5280 4 0 which we can find on developer

611
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:06,390
but with the DK boards or dongle USB and

612
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:10,769
RF 52 this chip it's very much useful

613
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:13,230
because it has DL also has hardwood

614
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:15,569
cryptography capabilities and can be

615
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:19,529
used for the token because it is small

616
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:20,970
device and also an HSM module that will

617
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:22,730
be added to the server

618
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,589
this way all cryptographic operations

619
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:28,890
will be conducted in a secure way and

620
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:31,140
outside of the computer's hardware that

621
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:34,828
can have been could have been attacked

622
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:37,859
by any kind of malware so why a blix as

623
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:40,140
we've said already we try to be fully

624
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,819
transparent with the idea that they use

625
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,400
it just but coming close to the laptop

626
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:47,759
and just with a small notion they need

627
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,809
to lock without without entering

628
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:56,460
password or a username that means that

629
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:58,769
for a company well at a given companies

630
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,509
thousands of employees can lock onto a

631
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:02,279
device without having the device with

632
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:08,390
them just moving around infrastructures

633
00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:11,460
so why a Blix once again because for the

634
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:13,529
we've seen that we are not identified by

635
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,329
passwords but we are identified by the

636
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:15,880
fact that we're people thank you very

637
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:24,579
much

638
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:24,579
[Applause]

639
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:31,060
siente yota vigilant

640
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:10,170
I'm one of those good morning everyone

641
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:14,309
this is IOT vigilant project right to

642
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:16,529
left we have David and Guillermo and

643
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:19,380
then Carlos he couldn't make it today

644
00:40:16,529 --> 00:40:22,410
but he will be joining us on Friday we

645
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:28,049
were formal former colleagues and we

646
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:30,690
work on pentesting this is IOT threat

647
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:33,829
detection this is based on abnormalities

648
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:37,680
or anomalies rather we monitor the

649
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:39,599
network the web rather we use machine

650
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,328
learning for detection and through

651
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,670
processing we produce a series of alerts

652
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:48,269
or warnings simple as that

653
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:50,549
why well probably we should dwell on

654
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:54,149
that but the number of IOT devices is

655
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:58,799
growing at an alarming rate and those

656
00:40:54,150 --> 00:41:02,279
devices our target of attacks for but

657
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:04,650
net farming fishing intrusions etc so

658
00:41:02,279 --> 00:41:06,660
the ID here would be to learn how to

659
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,910
detect the attacks in a different way

660
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,690
and be up and ready for those that we

661
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:15,989
are not aware of yet

662
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:18,269
traditionally attack detection or breach

663
00:41:15,989 --> 00:41:20,779
detection has been focused on signature

664
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:20,779
mainly

665
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:28,080
which is a bit more useful for passed

666
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,080
and set in so to say because in the past

667
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,700
attacks were better known there was some

668
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,759
fewer attacks and it was easier to

669
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:41,350
detect but now we do have a setting or

670
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,940
an environment what devices are new and

671
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:46,029
attacks are new as well and they'll

672
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,160
change so we need to learn how to detect

673
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,980
those attacks that we are unaware of now

674
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,430
so what's the basis here the idea is

675
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:57,520
that IOT devices are different from

676
00:41:54,430 --> 00:42:05,230
those servers because they will be

677
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:08,200
simpler and predictable right now we

678
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:11,560
don't have any solutions that are open

679
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,970
source and focused on IOT malware

680
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:18,070
detection tests like that so what are

681
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:21,669
typical systems that we are familiar

682
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,540
with ID in turn it's norsu together that

683
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:27,100
are IDS's

684
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:29,920
they use preset standards and signature

685
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:32,290
and other elements so the requirement

686
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,560
that we set in order to solve the

687
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:38,860
problem is using a predictable condition

688
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,920
settings that is what gives us would we

689
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:46,090
get out of IOT devices and we find this

690
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,180
is perfect for a machine learning so

691
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,730
we've realized that there are some

692
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,690
solutions such as IOT security or sing

693
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,170
bugs

694
00:42:52,690 --> 00:43:00,880
IOT and in these few cases we see these

695
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:02,550
are patented and so there's another one

696
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,910
rockzilla

697
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:09,100
from Brazil which has some limitations

698
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:14,350
in its implementation them and we can

699
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:16,600
discuss that later but I'm referring

700
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:19,540
here to the algorithms that are used so

701
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:23,210
what are the advantages are IOT vigilant

702
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:26,720
it is open source for of course

703
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:29,329
we'll be using a detection algorithm

704
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,660
with ml that we think will improve

705
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:35,540
intrusion detection rate and we will try

706
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:39,740
and focus it on having a simple

707
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:43,849
deployment or easily deployed what we

708
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:47,899
want to develop is an unsupervised a an

709
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:50,270
IDs which is an IDs on the network that

710
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,030
will detect anomalous and will not be

711
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:55,849
supervisor it'll be unsupervised as we

712
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,480
said before we are unaware of the

713
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:59,030
attacks

714
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,670
they'll be so we cannot have ml tagging

715
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:03,470
and we cannot be up and ready in advance

716
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:07,490
we cannot train the system so the idea

717
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:10,220
is to use this unsupervised system so

718
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:13,430
what will be used will we be using a

719
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:17,180
full open source framework elasticsearch

720
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:19,279
graph an ax flask as well we are

721
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:24,290
planning on that and mainly the

722
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:27,079
scikit-learn which is the ml Lu library

723
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:30,920
with Python that has thousands of

724
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:33,559
different algorithms on top of that the

725
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:38,119
idea is that what would you see that in

726
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:39,950
a minute but we can combine the learning

727
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:44,559
from different settings to increase the

728
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:48,618
system efficacy through machine learning

729
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:52,460
our target with this project would be 84

730
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:56,420
slot for large business networks where

731
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:59,660
we have IOT miss control hospitals

732
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:01,910
industrial environments as well another

733
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:07,279
idea would be that we do not want to

734
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:10,098
cover it all what we mean is what we

735
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,700
mean to detect unknown anomalies so the

736
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:18,170
idea is that we do not mean to cover it

737
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:20,598
all we just want to design a system that

738
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:23,200
can be easily integrated and embedded

739
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:26,030
into other devices or for example

740
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,790
signature systems and that way we can

741
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:30,890
have an Hommage genius defense system or

742
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:33,680
security system since we want it to be

743
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:35,690
straightforward and easily deployable of

744
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,799
course it can be deployed in our system

745
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:43,340
such as

746
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:45,350
Timothy or home settings where are we we

747
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:49,070
are starting from scratch haven't been

748
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:52,370
anything so far we just heart the

749
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:59,210
research stage on machine learning but

750
00:45:52,370 --> 00:46:02,029
we are still trying to specify what we

751
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:04,190
are going to use and that's the time for

752
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:08,180
a decision we will have to develop and

753
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:10,520
bet all system modules as well what

754
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:13,990
about features what what features do we

755
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:17,420
have here we will be able to detect

756
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:20,540
devices under attack devices that are

757
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:23,360
used for an attack and we will have full

758
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:25,400
visibility of the network because we

759
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,680
will see that some are behaving weirdly

760
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:36,560
because they showed up or gone away and

761
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:38,270
as we know thank you very much una una

762
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,049
cosa gets implemented when over a sea

763
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:46,190
animal see that there is a tablet around

764
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:48,230
there for time tracking I wish you could

765
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:52,160
all have as much time as you need for

766
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:54,500
your 14 teams that's a no-go that's the

767
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,629
kind of and not so much about this

768
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,580
presentation because it matters but I'm

769
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,070
so much but I guess this is a good

770
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,900
training for the final presentation

771
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:05,120
you'll be given 11 minutes but you need

772
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:06,590
to show the functionality and the

773
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,960
features that you need to be aware of

774
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:12,170
the time limit are set by the room and

775
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,300
that's all it is not that we are

776
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:17,690
dragging you around but that's we

777
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:21,760
because we're forced and also a teaching

778
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:23,820
lesson for last day's presentation

779
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,820
you

780
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:40,140
can you check that you can hear the

781
00:47:35,009 --> 00:47:45,380
sound from my computer or my device

782
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:52,319
can you hear CNN chief all jagged EMS

783
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:59,269
like the jack in the volume sound should

784
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:59,269
be hear it now anymore

785
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:16,920
yo creo que si one DNA pinda C no parent

786
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,919
ammos or sister cio

787
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,029
but all of it

788
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:40,210
especially yogi in duplicate CC massive

789
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,210
success in what I said

790
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:47,170
Oh

791
00:48:53,240 --> 00:49:03,770
one of the s get up mm-hmm ammonium

792
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:06,080
let's get started I'll need to be brief

793
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:09,110
bad six minutes

794
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:12,230
well I have to be fast one cool that's

795
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:15,860
my name I work at BBVA next technologies

796
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:20,420
I try to make sure that what's developed

797
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:22,570
at the bank is more secure and first the

798
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:25,670
question what's coming in all those apps

799
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:27,340
whatsapp or telegram scarab Gmail

800
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:32,060
Outlook

801
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:35,000
and notepad notepad well it's been a bit

802
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:38,570
crazy right but people tend to use them

803
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:42,320
for storage and sharing secrets and

804
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:45,200
what's the secret password and API key

805
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:49,130
an access token credit card a pin code I

806
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:51,169
kept a graphically the hex that XML code

807
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:54,710
that we've been given for example to

808
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:56,480
identify our teams so anything that we

809
00:49:54,710 --> 00:50:00,830
find is vulnerable and we don't want

810
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:04,280
anyone else to know about so haven't you

811
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:06,020
ever seen and password on notepad or

812
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,660
maybe you've been forwarded to

813
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:11,660
credentials or maybe the well-known

814
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:15,200
excel sheet on Google Drive with machine

815
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:17,960
IPS and passwords for SSH connection for

816
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,569
example so if that kind of information

817
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:23,300
falls and the ragam wrong the wrong

818
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:33,080
hands you can picture what it happens as

819
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:36,920
predicted by the symptoms and thank you

820
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:42,830
that was why I need the sound

821
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:44,750
creepy isn't it there are some apps out

822
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,569
in the market well apps that helps us

823
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:50,900
out here we have keep has probably you

824
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:54,020
know that which is the local file and a

825
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:58,400
master key where we enter our secrets

826
00:50:54,020 --> 00:51:00,680
and it's encrypted and then on a local

827
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,720
file cuba's is quite good isn't it

828
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,419
but if we want to have our secret

829
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,640
anywhere or from any device we need to

830
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:10,190
carry it around and we need to send the

831
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,170
file over and over so it this is a drag

832
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,000
I needed doesn't solve the problem of

833
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:16,340
sharing tickets with someone else what

834
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,950
about you wanna send as two good I don't

835
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:22,610
know my bank account if you want to

836
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:24,259
check checking something so it's it's a

837
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:26,060
drag again you need to send it and

838
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,400
resend it and then the master key some

839
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,440
ham and once again the same problem and

840
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,880
then on keep us if you forget the master

841
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:37,820
key your secrets are gone for good

842
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,550
then last pass a bit not so well known

843
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:45,380
but it's an online ad also based on a

844
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:48,290
master tiin there is a recovery system

845
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:51,020
if you lose the key but I find it is not

846
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:53,930
secure because you need to keep on your

847
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:56,770
device information to recover your

848
00:51:53,930 --> 00:52:00,290
secrets and information which I find

849
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:02,900
should not be on the device I'm not a

850
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:05,090
fan of it you can share secrets with

851
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:07,250
other users there's a feature but you

852
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:13,280
need to pay for that as well as others

853
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:15,380
and it is not cool but LastPass is not

854
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,790
open source so we don't really know what

855
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,790
they do with our secrets

856
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:25,420
despite it all there is another

857
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:27,670
hindrance here the worst one why I would

858
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:31,750
not use it and why many people don't use

859
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:37,330
it this one serious vulnerabilities in

860
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:40,720
the past so what's my proposal this is

861
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:45,430
an online app where you can upload your

862
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:48,850
secrets kept on a server and you can use

863
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:51,640
it anywhere and you might say how can we

864
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:54,520
want to protect our secrets how will we

865
00:52:51,640 --> 00:53:00,400
keep it on a server they will be

866
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:03,600
encrypted and we will be encrypting them

867
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,030
with client-side encryption where

868
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:09,670
client-side that is to devise the

869
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:12,580
browser whatever you log in with your

870
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:14,590
password then you are sent to a

871
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:16,750
cryptographic key and when we enter a

872
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:19,600
secret we use a cryptographic key and

873
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:21,460
then we all send it this is all done

874
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:25,360
flying on the client side with

875
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:30,430
JavaScript and this is then sent to the

876
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:35,020
server and then this is all kept on an

877
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:39,669
encrypted database and with the password

878
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:42,610
we recover them and decrypt them we need

879
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:44,920
to highlight that our secret information

880
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:47,380
is never revealed on the device it's

881
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:50,170
always encrypted client-side and then

882
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:52,440
the cryptographic key for encrypting and

883
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:55,600
decrypting is not stored anywhere

884
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:56,440
actually is done on the fly as we enter

885
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:00,130
the password

886
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:02,980
so for these to be possible we need to

887
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:05,440
use the single page application

888
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:08,410
technology where the whole front end of

889
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,450
this website is oh now you are all at

890
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:13,029
the same one so we you can enter that

891
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:15,480
into the login page and we can get the

892
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:19,120
cryptographic key and then we need to

893
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:21,250
send it over to you well we don't have

894
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,470
to we just store it on JavaScript and

895
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:26,980
since this side is on the same viewer

896
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:29,850
our l is there and we don't have to do

897
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,850
anything about it

898
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:38,770
how do we share secrets with other users

899
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:41,529
what you are well it will end up with

900
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:47,560
two different keys with non symmetrical

901
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:53,310
encryption RSA keys so and the server

902
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:53,310
knows the public keys of all users and

903
00:54:53,610 --> 00:55:01,060
other users can only decipher that

904
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:03,790
secret if they have the secret master

905
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:08,710
key because you don't want to store all

906
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:12,130
that information on your devices for

907
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:15,070
other people to be able to find your

908
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:18,100
secrets or retrieve your secrets and

909
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:21,930
then we won't just have two different

910
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:25,089
keys but further key is depending on

911
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:28,210
security questions the private key

912
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:31,030
depending on the password it depends on

913
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:33,880
the security questions we send that

914
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:37,600
information to the server and then if we

915
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:40,480
forget the password but we remember the

916
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:45,160
answers to the questions we can still

917
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:47,860
retrieve the key right last but not

918
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:50,290
least technologies from the front end

919
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:54,820
and we need something powerful

920
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:57,070
Riyad and then JavaScript as well

921
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:59,560
because of all the security

922
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:02,530
functionalities that come with it for

923
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:06,430
the database I think because it's a

924
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:11,760
related model and my SQL is best for us

925
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:14,770
and I will try and follow the most

926
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:18,220
secure pathways and the best practices

927
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:22,720
for security purposes it will be a fully

928
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:26,250
open source application it will be

929
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,250
uploaded into the hub

930
00:56:27,569 --> 00:56:37,210
to the EIT hub geez help and whoever

931
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:40,329
wants to use it a user's company's

932
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:42,579
private users companies just using a

933
00:56:40,329 --> 00:56:44,950
password they could and who's going to

934
00:56:42,579 --> 00:56:46,900
pay for that well supposedly me if it's

935
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,960
not too much money thank you for your

936
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:52,449
attention

937
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,449
[Applause]

938
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:34,700
[Music]

939
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:38,129
let's start with our application blue

940
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,470
fingerprint why is it called like that

941
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:43,710
well because a blue tooth that's the

942
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:46,169
blue part of it because it will be using

943
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:50,339
bluetooth and then we will be

944
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:52,200
implemented implementing an NFC to make

945
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:55,470
it faster and then blueprint a

946
00:57:52,200 --> 00:58:01,230
fingerprint because a fingerprint will

947
00:57:55,470 --> 00:58:03,649
be important as you will see so let's

948
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:08,880
start at the beginning

949
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:16,200
mobile phones will be identified as

950
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:21,900
unique through symmetrical keys the user

951
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:24,480
would have a particular key all the time

952
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:31,700
and so would the mobile phone device

953
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:35,819
method so at the end of the connection a

954
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:40,189
second symmetrical key will be used so

955
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:46,380
that it can be used the following time

956
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:50,940
through LED or maybe through a serial

957
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:54,839
port we will be verifying if the device

958
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:58,740
is authorized and then if you want to

959
00:58:54,839 --> 00:59:04,170
add new users and there is the master

960
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:08,758
mobile system to generate the key and

961
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:11,519
the master would let Arduino have that

962
00:59:08,759 --> 00:59:14,220
information so that we can make sure

963
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:16,549
that a legitimate device that should be

964
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:20,759
accepted

965
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:25,439
the master token can be changed just by

966
00:59:20,759 --> 00:59:28,499
scanning the QR code that the master

967
00:59:25,439 --> 00:59:31,769
generates and that provides a

968
00:59:28,499 --> 00:59:35,339
symmetrical key the following master

969
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:38,279
would scan it and whoever connects to

970
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:41,219
Arduino it would get that next that

971
00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:44,059
following symmetric okey and it's the

972
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:49,229
master is the only one who can register

973
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:53,959
users now what security areas are

974
00:59:49,229 --> 00:59:59,189
covered from this well confidentiality

975
00:59:53,959 --> 01:00:02,939
and saving of symmetrical keys what

976
00:59:59,189 --> 01:00:07,109
about a authen authentication well

977
01:00:02,939 --> 01:00:12,509
that's based on a register on a log of

978
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:19,019
all users in the past the following

979
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:23,699
feature would be integrity the idea is

980
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:25,859
that through symmetrical encryption we

981
01:00:23,699 --> 01:00:30,749
just want to make sure that files are

982
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:36,749
not shared a Unduli with external

983
01:00:30,749 --> 01:00:43,140
stakeholders the master will be the only

984
01:00:36,749 --> 01:00:45,660
one accessing the user list so why do we

985
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:49,379
have these features as opposed to

986
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:52,308
anything else we don't have other

987
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:56,479
authentication or identification

988
01:00:52,309 --> 01:01:08,489
mechanisms we decided these were easily

989
01:00:56,479 --> 01:01:12,928
implemented safe enough low cost what

990
01:01:08,489 --> 01:01:15,839
about our target audience who has this

991
01:01:12,929 --> 01:01:18,900
type of need well it would be anybody in

992
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:23,729
the community that complies with these

993
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:27,170
needs gate oriented needs that require

994
01:01:23,729 --> 01:01:30,558
access through registration

995
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:36,849
in the authentication process

996
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:36,849
well that would that would have secured

997
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:44,420
identification for instance a lock log

998
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:50,619
in the main access to a company that

999
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:55,579
would be a typical example and fils NF

1000
01:01:50,619 --> 01:02:00,530
NFC project can also work like this but

1001
01:01:55,579 --> 01:02:03,799
we decided a Bluetooth may be best NFC

1002
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:05,569
can make the process faster and we think

1003
01:02:03,799 --> 01:02:08,690
that it would be an interesting

1004
01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:10,579
development for the future but initially

1005
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:13,280
we thought it would be more realistic

1006
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:17,440
starting with just Bluetooth that's

1007
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:21,260
right because is fine with encryption

1008
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:23,329
otherwise Arduino would not see that the

1009
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:25,040
communication was taking place and we

1010
01:02:23,329 --> 01:02:29,089
want encryption we really want

1011
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:32,079
encryption how did they start because we

1012
01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:34,869
want secure communication between

1013
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:39,890
devices and other pieces of equipment

1014
01:02:34,869 --> 01:02:43,780
with low computation performance or

1015
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:43,779
possibilities of computing power sorry

1016
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:51,140
this system is versatile and Arduino is

1017
01:02:48,589 --> 01:02:56,720
good enough for what we need to do at

1018
01:02:51,140 --> 01:03:01,759
the moment we have come with part of

1019
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:05,089
their development already how we think

1020
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:08,660
it could be a very useful development is

1021
01:03:05,089 --> 01:03:12,859
pretty minimalistic really but it can

1022
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:16,240
contribute so much it can be adapted in

1023
01:03:12,859 --> 01:03:16,240
the future customized

1024
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:27,509
let's see how this is going to be

1025
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:30,390
working Arduino wouldn't identify the

1026
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:35,070
device users need to be registered

1027
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:37,589
through the QR code they Arduino memory

1028
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:40,710
has to save that and then it would be

1029
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,620
encryption the last step as well from us

1030
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:49,120
thank you very much for your attention

1031
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:49,120

1034
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:14,230
tada

1035
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:31,049
bm1 ouvea good morning our team has come

1036
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:36,930
up with this idea stuck our names

1037
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:41,760
guillermo Alvaro and even and we want

1038
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:46,680
stuck to help users and systems

1039
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:52,320
administrators easier and how through

1040
01:04:46,680 --> 01:05:00,430
managing authentication keys more easily

1041
01:04:52,320 --> 01:05:04,450
and also helping communications at the

1042
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:09,160
service level and also a keeping users

1043
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:14,169
credentials secure we can manage access

1044
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:16,720
to SSH or any other service so that it

1045
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:25,180
can be done securely through an

1046
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:27,669
authentication process and using ports

1047
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:30,240
knocking technology later we will tell

1048
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:36,780
you a little bit more about that

1049
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:48,009
we also help supply automatically supply

1050
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:51,850
passwords to users so what do we want to

1051
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:55,620
cover with this project as far as users

1052
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:59,170
are concerned we would offer secure

1053
01:05:55,620 --> 01:06:04,509
communication managing their passwords

1054
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:10,480
different levels of authentication and

1055
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:15,490
then for systems administrators we will

1056
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:19,890
close access to resources unless they're

1057
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:23,770
absolutely necessary obviously always

1058
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:26,830
registering and identifying clients and

1059
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:30,450
users who do we want to target

1060
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:33,640
well academia our universities

1061
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:39,189
laboratories different organizations

1062
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:42,910
that need to limit access to certain

1063
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:45,250
users what is port knocking then this

1064
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:49,420
technology started at the beginning of

1065
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:53,470
the 21st century the idea is that users

1066
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:59,110
follow sequence and an access token to

1067
01:06:53,470 --> 01:07:01,359
then access a server that's detected by

1068
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:07,990
a firewall and if everything is correct

1069
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:10,810
a permission is granted in our case a

1070
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:14,890
authentication happens within the system

1071
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:18,790
by managing the keys the passwords as we

1072
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:22,390
said and permissions permits a will be

1073
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:24,520
temporary or permanent whatever the

1074
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:27,069
situation requires what about

1075
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:30,540
authentication but we have different

1076
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:37,720
options there one is Google

1077
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:42,940
Authenticator this is the GPG he's the

1078
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:51,069
typical technology that USB sticks bring

1079
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:53,610
or come with micro this is the solution

1080
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:58,480
we probably propose combining

1081
01:07:53,610 --> 01:08:01,020
authentication at the user side although

1082
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,840
the user doesn't have to necessarily

1083
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:07,120
generate the keys or the passwords they

1084
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:12,460
can do so or they can continue to use

1085
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:15,910
their passwords their keys but the idea

1086
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:19,000
is that keys are automatically managed

1087
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:23,099
by the infrastructure you can see the

1088
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:28,770
port knocking mechanism is the one that

1089
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:32,160
implicitly authenticates and gives

1090
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:36,160
access to different resources as

1091
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:40,050
required you can see that we combine the

1092
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:40,050
access mechanism

1093
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:47,970
authentication through the double factor

1094
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:53,819
system or through a physical password

1095
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:55,830
okey here we can see an example of how

1096
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:58,469
to implement this solution you can see

1097
01:08:55,830 --> 01:09:02,700
the customer site at the bottom and the

1098
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:05,810
supervision side at the top which can be

1099
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:09,929
isolated from the general infrastructure

1100
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:12,990
so that there is supervision in place

1101
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:17,790
that's their role supervising that is

1102
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:21,809
the cop the passwords the keys very

1103
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:30,120
similar role to what some clouds are

1104
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:34,320
doing for instance Amazon or Emma there

1105
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:36,510
is authentication true but also managing

1106
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:41,099
the keys that that's more and more

1107
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:43,490
common thing in cloud systems here we

1108
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:48,900
can see the LastPass or Google

1109
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:55,219
Authenticator or whatever implementation

1110
01:09:48,899 --> 01:10:01,160
that's in charge of totp this is where

1111
01:09:55,220 --> 01:10:04,730
the application for services takes place

1112
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,730
in that case

1113
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:12,240
frame time frame work starts we're

1114
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:14,850
through SSH or whatever and that can

1115
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:21,599
happen here we can see that technologies

1116
01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:24,270
involved Ruby and firebase you can

1117
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:28,140
understand this is completely outside

1118
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:31,530
the infrastructure so that there is no

1119
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:35,070
risk of security breaches and then a

1120
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:38,190
Python and docker and the customer site

1121
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:40,950
at the Python site as all that's

1122
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:44,339
required for the infrastructure we have

1123
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:46,410
been searching and finding just

1124
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:48,720
documenting four different possibilities

1125
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:50,330
for the solution so far thank you very

1126
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:53,909
much for your attention

1127
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:53,909
[Applause]

1128
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:20,780
she's thinking with your to see how that

1129
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:20,780
bones is heavy

1130
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:37,339
she know

1131
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:48,900
- a todos so more sunshine

1132
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:52,260
good morning our names are uncle and

1133
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:54,960
Miguel our hell and here is fast fish a

1134
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:58,410
a proposal for this platform to detect

1135
01:11:54,960 --> 01:12:01,140
fishing in any environment we don't need

1136
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:04,380
to analyze documents so this is quite

1137
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:06,540
generic providing both active and

1138
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:09,330
passive protection and this is not just

1139
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:12,660
smoke you will see how it wants to be an

1140
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:15,360
efficient and scalable solution because

1141
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:18,960
we feel that what is currently available

1142
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:21,870
doesn't comply with those basic features

1143
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,560
and it has to be modular we think so

1144
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:29,519
that people have what they need no more

1145
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:32,730
or less here we can see how we start

1146
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:38,450
with analysis on demand for customers

1147
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:43,440
that is a it can be a DNS server

1148
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:46,679
responding to users queries and then the

1149
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:49,679
service could just block her thinking it

1150
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:53,460
was something malicious then it can use

1151
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:56,220
both blacklist and white lists there's

1152
01:12:53,460 --> 01:13:01,530
another layer here which is interesting

1153
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:06,020
then new where we compare the canvas

1154
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:10,040
generated by HTML for instance said

1155
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:13,110
comparing Twitter with Twitter's or

1156
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:18,200
different alphabets that different

1157
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:18,200
languages use and then there's the layer

1158
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:32,129
for email analytics not checking the

1159
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:34,219
files that are that come in your emails

1160
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:37,220
because that's already checked by the

1161
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:37,220
antivirus

1162
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:45,299
the application would be cruel enough

1163
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:47,910
different potential links that could be

1164
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:51,120
malicious and pre checking them before

1165
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:53,580
users even require them to be checked

1166
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,780
there is also transparency which is

1167
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:58,410
quite innovative

1168
01:13:54,780 --> 01:14:00,450
so that domains can be checked just a

1169
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:03,570
few minutes after even after they've

1170
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:08,670
been registered and all of that with

1171
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:10,830
really updated databases so that we can

1172
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:13,530
use databases that have already been

1173
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:19,250
analyzed by other teams and why do we

1174
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:19,250
think this project is important many

1175
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:29,400
companies are doing phishing accessing

1176
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:33,830
credentials and not just through an

1177
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:37,230
exploit that access is on a zero-day

1178
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:39,960
human resources database most phishing

1179
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:44,059
cases are not based on Trojans or

1180
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:47,100
exploits but through a captive gateway

1181
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:49,380
getting users to send you their

1182
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:52,890
credentials because users are much

1183
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:58,140
easier much more easily cheated than

1184
01:14:52,890 --> 01:15:03,630
systems this is a bit peculiar but this

1185
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:08,040
is fish tanks users upload cases that

1186
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:10,440
they think are phishing and if a certain

1187
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:13,019
number of users vote that could be

1188
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:14,790
fishing then that's studied and analyzed

1189
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:15,600
look at that between October and

1190
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:19,320
November

1191
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:22,560
most phishing cases even over 80% of

1192
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:26,009
those were finally scored as positive

1193
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,020
that means that phishing detections are

1194
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:30,630
often fishing at the end of the day and

1195
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:34,580
there are a lot of them so this platform

1196
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:37,380
will help all sorts of organizations

1197
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:39,990
where this might be compulsory for all

1198
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:42,570
users or sometimes for private

1199
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:44,610
individuals at home it could be a little

1200
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:48,719
bit of a complement to Chrome for

1201
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:50,860
instance or sometimes where you have 1

1202
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:53,409
million URLs you know it

1203
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:56,349
can also cope with that volume and tell

1204
01:15:53,409 --> 01:15:59,530
you which ones might be fishing what

1205
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:02,260
technologies do we want to use well we

1206
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:07,679
want to be fairly open with that we want

1207
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:10,690
a module communications to be diagnostic

1208
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:14,199
the backend for the moment will be go

1209
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:17,199
but depending on our resources and time

1210
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:23,349
that might change and readies for our

1211
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:26,769
cash a cash and then we don't want to

1212
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:29,469
use different ratios we want to have a

1213
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:32,710
domain and then end up with a certain

1214
01:16:29,469 --> 01:16:36,239
percentage telling us whether it's going

1215
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:40,810
to likely be fishing or not there are

1216
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:42,730
sort of similar tools the second one

1217
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:44,830
that we can see up on the screen in fact

1218
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:47,409
is based on the first one but they come

1219
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:49,800
with quite a lot of bugs or well not

1220
01:16:47,409 --> 01:16:53,909
bugs but they're a little bit incomplete

1221
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:56,920
the certificate transparency is not

1222
01:16:53,909 --> 01:17:00,339
complete they're not modular they're

1223
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:02,469
open source but developments they are

1224
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:05,949
pretty complex because they're not

1225
01:17:02,469 --> 01:17:09,190
modular no matrix and also they're not

1226
01:17:05,949 --> 01:17:12,820
stable scalable or they work with a

1227
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:15,339
binary code that you run and you just

1228
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:17,380
leave it at that so what are we going to

1229
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:20,920
be doing here we didn't bring anything

1230
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:23,409
that we made earlier we we didn't we

1231
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:25,929
haven't written any of the code and we

1232
01:17:23,409 --> 01:17:31,269
want to end up with the core at least

1233
01:17:25,929 --> 01:17:39,100
the basic part for passive analysis of

1234
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:45,250
domains also an analytic module that can

1235
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:51,429
then provide the analysis and then the

1236
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:53,409
on-demand queries what else we have when

1237
01:17:51,429 --> 01:17:56,650
integration with the database the

1238
01:17:53,409 --> 01:17:57,620
databases and that's all from us thank

1239
01:17:56,650 --> 01:18:04,779
you very much for your attention

1240
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:04,779
[Applause]

1241
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:56,519
when is this a toaster so good morning

1242
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:59,580
our team tygris it wants to tell you

1243
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:03,180
about our proposed on arrow heat for

1244
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:06,090
Wi-Fi captures with a tool we will

1245
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:07,610
describe there are four of us in the

1246
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:12,000
team four Tigers

1247
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:14,990
Raul Silvia Ricardo and my name is Elena

1248
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,720
we work together as cyber security

1249
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:20,610
analysts at the same company and now my

1250
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:24,090
colleague will tell you more about our

1251
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:31,820
tool well the main features we want to

1252
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:31,820
cover the following starting with Egret

1253
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:40,530
with I crack we will end up with a

1254
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:44,280
database which will in turn generate

1255
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:47,219
heat maps different tables and

1256
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:50,940
statistics on that first capture that

1257
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:54,840
can be analyzed a at a later date all of

1258
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:56,519
that at a with a web interface and then

1259
01:19:54,840 --> 01:20:00,810
one of the tables that we want to

1260
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:07,560
implement would will list potential

1261
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:09,920
customers and possible breaches what

1262
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:15,720
about our target audience and

1263
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:18,720
application well we want to target a

1264
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:22,160
cyber security analysts interested in

1265
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:27,810
Wi-Fi and anybody who is interested in

1266
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:33,030
passive capture of Wi-Fi networks and as

1267
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:38,100
a user case we want to see a cover

1268
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:41,849
coverage analysis range analysis on the

1269
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:44,190
basis of the heat maps what is in the

1270
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:46,230
markets in this sense well it's a critic

1271
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:49,679
it works very well but you have to pay

1272
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:52,889
for it also we wanted to have something

1273
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:55,530
which is multi-platform which is why air

1274
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:59,070
crack might be better air which works

1275
01:20:55,530 --> 01:21:02,199
with Linux but it can also work with

1276
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:04,978
Windows and all of that with a web

1277
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:08,499
interface so that there's agility and

1278
01:21:04,979 --> 01:21:12,099
scalability and usability so that is

1279
01:21:08,499 --> 01:21:16,119
user friendly we're going to start with

1280
01:21:12,099 --> 01:21:19,559
the air crack code then we're going to

1281
01:21:16,119 --> 01:21:24,070
have access to the database for queries

1282
01:21:19,559 --> 01:21:27,969
adding information then that is not that

1283
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:31,079
doesn't come by default and then after

1284
01:21:27,969 --> 01:21:37,329
that we want at the design of heat maps

1285
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:41,110
take information tables with customers

1286
01:21:37,329 --> 01:21:44,018
the probes for analytics to be possible

1287
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:48,429
all of that has to be implemented a on a

1288
01:21:44,019 --> 01:21:50,349
web interface and if we have time we

1289
01:21:48,429 --> 01:21:57,070
would like to have a little add-on

1290
01:21:50,349 --> 01:22:01,959
module Bluetooth scanning problem

1291
01:21:57,070 --> 01:22:04,478
program with a GPS so that that can be

1292
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:05,949
included with the tables that's all from

1293
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:06,840
us thank you very much for your

1294
01:22:05,949 --> 01:22:11,639
attention

1295
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:11,640
[Applause]

1296
01:22:27,949 --> 01:22:38,419
subin it's giving it seven it

Nastasia

1299
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:19,330
nope it'll be a routine but I know a

1300
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:27,950
little service where we opened Charlotte

1301
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:30,820
on Washington partly pardonable station

1302
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:30,820
oldest again

1303
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:11,210
on antique

1304
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:43,110
out

1305
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:46,239
on

1306
01:24:48,449 --> 01:24:59,580
hola we were not good morning welcome my

1307
01:24:56,310 --> 01:25:00,960
name is Alfonso and together with a Alex

1308
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:08,449
here man

1309
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:11,870
and Alfonso we make up the antique team

1310
01:25:08,449 --> 01:25:22,139
we were part of the black racer

1311
01:25:11,870 --> 01:25:24,989
conference we have won the last three

1312
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:27,929
years of this hackathon and so we hope

1313
01:25:24,989 --> 01:25:34,440
that you don't find that intimidating

1314
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:38,040
but rather that we can agree on to beat

1315
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:41,280
us this time we're going to try and give

1316
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:45,900
you good advice to do to do so this is

1317
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:50,429
our to our proposal I us in Latin it

1318
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:52,889
means law the idea is that this tool

1319
01:25:50,429 --> 01:25:55,770
will help us verify and comply with

1320
01:25:52,890 --> 01:26:00,780
different laws and regulations and

1321
01:25:55,770 --> 01:26:03,239
legislations in an autonomous manner we

1322
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:07,679
have there a short list of some laws and

1323
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:11,839
regulations we want to address and this

1324
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:15,630
too has three main roles one is

1325
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:21,449
analytics it will be analyzing websites

1326
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:25,860
that we supply then it will have

1327
01:26:21,449 --> 01:26:28,949
different technical details that it will

1328
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:31,219
cover and we will welcome any proposals

1329
01:26:28,949 --> 01:26:35,309
and ideas that you can give us for that

1330
01:26:31,219 --> 01:26:41,070
it will cover legal texts there will be

1331
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:46,329
an assessment and evaluation after that

1332
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:50,429
within finally recommendations so what

1333
01:26:46,329 --> 01:26:54,610
is our target audience really varied

1334
01:26:50,429 --> 01:27:03,309
sometimes professionals people who work

1335
01:26:54,610 --> 01:27:06,848
with testing people who own websites and

1336
01:27:03,309 --> 01:27:09,119
want to comply with regulations this

1337
01:27:06,849 --> 01:27:12,999
could be an interesting tool for them

1338
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:18,098
also private individuals normal users a

1339
01:27:12,999 --> 01:27:20,409
hue browsing I want to know what

1340
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:22,840
legislation they should be complying

1341
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:25,780
with and we know that's in the European

1342
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:30,219
Union and public institutions in general

1343
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:33,699
more and more laws and regulations are

1344
01:27:30,219 --> 01:27:36,989
coming to the forefront sometimes with

1345
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:39,820
very heavy penalties if we don't comply

1346
01:27:36,989 --> 01:27:43,749
now there are different possibilities at

1347
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:48,459
the moment our Q net takes a open VI yes

1348
01:27:43,749 --> 01:27:52,570
but they don't focus too much on legal

1349
01:27:48,459 --> 01:27:55,709
details if you want to audit a legal

1350
01:27:52,570 --> 01:28:00,880
websites you need to read very

1351
01:27:55,709 --> 01:28:02,619
long-winded complex legal texts there

1352
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:05,199
are different forms there are different

1353
01:28:02,619 --> 01:28:08,530
checklists and that are available but

1354
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:10,659
it's very manual process really we feel

1355
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:15,039
it's about time that we have an

1356
01:28:10,659 --> 01:28:18,879
automatic automated autonomous to and

1357
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:21,929
that can do so for us so that you can

1358
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:25,409
use it even if you don't have very

1359
01:28:21,929 --> 01:28:28,269
technical knowledge or legal knowledge

1360
01:28:25,409 --> 01:28:31,839
what do we need technologically well

1361
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:40,479
acquire and running the program as such

1362
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:43,329
and then an interface GU I will be using

1363
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:45,790
PHP because we're good at it

1364
01:28:43,329 --> 01:28:49,719
we haven't decided which database will

1365
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:52,530
be using yet we will welcome any

1366
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:58,449
suggestions will be using javascript

1367
01:28:52,530 --> 01:29:04,509
HTML and also selenium and that helps

1368
01:28:58,449 --> 01:29:08,650
test websites what did we come with well

1369
01:29:04,510 --> 01:29:11,460
we haven't developed any code we didn't

1370
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:17,379
we haven't written one single line of

1371
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:20,349
code and what we wanted to have as an

1372
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:24,849
objective for this year is ending up

1373
01:29:20,349 --> 01:29:30,699
with a complete fully completed err - at

1374
01:29:24,849 --> 01:29:34,889
the end of the hackathon we think this

1375
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:38,440
will be complex why because we want

1376
01:29:34,889 --> 01:29:42,520
rapid scalable code that will be hard

1377
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:46,928
and also the fact that websites they are

1378
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:48,849
really heterogeneous detecting cookies

1379
01:29:46,929 --> 01:29:53,679
or a number of things like that is

1380
01:29:48,849 --> 01:29:57,420
simple but a not types of texts and so

1381
01:29:53,679 --> 01:30:04,360
on we still haven't decided what

1382
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:09,730
information will be displayed err by the

1383
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:15,040
GUI what benefits will our to bring to

1384
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:20,650
our community well we'll be using open

1385
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:23,260
code it will be an autonomous - it will

1386
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:27,269
be covering some needs that are at the

1387
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:30,309
moment uncovered it will be very

1388
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:33,420
integrating new technologies different

1389
01:30:30,309 --> 01:30:36,159
technologies again we will welcome any

1390
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:38,880
suggestions from you and then also

1391
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:43,119
because it will be collaborative design

1392
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:45,670
we can then add different legislations

1393
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:47,019
in future and also it will be able to

1394
01:30:45,670 --> 01:30:48,679
cope with different languages and

1395
01:30:47,020 --> 01:30:50,360
translations we

1396
01:30:48,679 --> 01:31:03,309
very much look forward to your questions

1397
01:30:50,360 --> 01:31:07,280
and comments later on record that

1398
01:31:03,309 --> 01:31:11,510
gustaría do remember we would like to

1399
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:14,539
have the questions right after the

1400
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:16,130
presentation but we thought you will all

1401
01:31:14,539 --> 01:31:19,429
be given the same opportunity and

1402
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:22,639
afterwards we will have the Q&A and just

1403
01:31:19,429 --> 01:31:25,760
encourage you all it is not just you who

1404
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:29,349
is nervous I was as well and I think I

1405
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:33,170
call Kea I call Alice Guillermo so I

1406
01:31:29,349 --> 01:31:35,090
apologize some of ye you look a bit more

1407
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:37,610
nervous about the hunter you worry this

1408
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:39,709
is the opening presentation and even if

1409
01:31:37,610 --> 01:31:43,119
it is important as we said we're well

1410
01:31:39,709 --> 01:31:43,119
aware of that right

1411
01:32:23,969 --> 01:32:31,630
good morning I'm Amelia and in part of

1412
01:32:27,969 --> 01:32:35,399
the 7a team first of all let me

1413
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:38,860
introduce you to my team we are

1414
01:32:35,399 --> 01:32:41,289
colleagues at Sevilla net and we are

1415
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:47,860
operating system developers we developed

1416
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:50,018
and Reuters for apps specifically what

1417
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:50,768
is known as service rooters these

1418
01:32:50,019 --> 01:32:53,919
routers

1419
01:32:50,769 --> 01:32:54,459
these are Alvaro and Lara Louise and

1420
01:32:53,919 --> 01:32:58,989
myself

1421
01:32:54,459 --> 01:33:01,898
Amelia that is so we are facing real

1422
01:32:58,989 --> 01:33:05,709
problems as we defined with our clients

1423
01:33:01,899 --> 01:33:08,289
if we ever need to protect the security

1424
01:33:05,709 --> 01:33:09,699
of a system would realize that the

1425
01:33:08,289 --> 01:33:12,369
protection the standards cannot be

1426
01:33:09,699 --> 01:33:14,110
generic in its scope because that's

1427
01:33:12,369 --> 01:33:16,419
where the protection is so very much

1428
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:19,299
needed and that's where the data flow is

1429
01:33:16,419 --> 01:33:21,610
the highest and a pattern that can be

1430
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:24,099
identified as an attacker cannot be an

1431
01:33:21,610 --> 01:33:26,919
attacker for another app running on the

1432
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:29,709
same defines so the first problem we

1433
01:33:26,919 --> 01:33:32,260
bring here is the data flow the

1434
01:33:29,709 --> 01:33:34,599
networking devices use different data

1435
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:38,110
flows on which we need to have different

1436
01:33:34,599 --> 01:33:41,039
security measures then another problem

1437
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:43,929
is that when we talk about security

1438
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:45,999
safety and security regardless of what

1439
01:33:43,929 --> 01:33:49,749
we are using on the operating system is

1440
01:33:45,999 --> 01:33:55,749
very costly so we need resources for CPE

1441
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:57,728
and memory management so what cases do

1442
01:33:55,749 --> 01:34:01,659
we bring here what case reports can we

1443
01:33:57,729 --> 01:34:05,559
bring as for security we can use

1444
01:34:01,659 --> 01:34:08,978
security in order to protect from DDoS

1445
01:34:05,559 --> 01:34:12,699
attacks for very material or very firm

1446
01:34:08,979 --> 01:34:14,979
firewalls or even load balancers this is

1447
01:34:12,699 --> 01:34:18,039
all about security management and how to

1448
01:34:14,979 --> 01:34:19,959
protect those balancers and we can also

1449
01:34:18,039 --> 01:34:21,880
use this technology that I'm about to

1450
01:34:19,959 --> 01:34:23,199
show to you for the security and

1451
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:26,649
protection of any kind of communication

1452
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:28,629
channels Klotz provider or an Internet

1453
01:34:26,649 --> 01:34:31,119
service providers of Watson what we

1454
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:32,820
propose here so we're trying to find a

1455
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:35,700
resilient security system

1456
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:38,309
I mean is that it is feeding back into

1457
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:40,500
itself we will avoid any kind of lock

1458
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:42,330
analysis so that we do not detect the

1459
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:45,900
attacker postmortem

1460
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:49,710
and we will follow real-time security

1461
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:54,240
standards we feel that a good security

1462
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:56,400
system is just a system where there is a

1463
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:59,730
defensive patterns in tip on different

1464
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:01,830
layers here you see two basic layers for

1465
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:07,049
the arson model which is transportation

1466
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:09,330
and application layers there are other

1467
01:35:07,050 --> 01:35:12,000
protection systems that can be targeted

1468
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:15,540
for a given layer such as anti fires but

1469
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,000
we feel this can be a deficit and we

1470
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:20,100
need to use information from different

1471
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:23,070
layers which can be very useful and

1472
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:25,410
difficult alive the target ordinance

1473
01:35:23,070 --> 01:35:28,530
would be in the system that is exposed

1474
01:35:25,410 --> 01:35:32,160
to the Internet this is our proposed

1475
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:37,110
diagram or flow chart on the top of a TC

1476
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:40,290
3 users that try to lock on to the load

1477
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:44,400
balancer on top of which we have the

1478
01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:47,880
security layer this is request 1 it's a

1479
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:50,700
regular user that locks onto the network

1480
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:53,730
device detecting the flow to be

1481
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:59,730
identified and resented G a lowered

1482
01:35:53,730 --> 01:36:02,190
layer that's where the user is now here

1483
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:05,929
you see an L for signal that's where we

1484
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:11,070
tried do you see the attack protection

1485
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:13,290
analysis using syn flood or others once

1486
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:15,870
the device has identified that the

1487
01:36:13,290 --> 01:36:20,400
attacker is not malware it is allowed on

1488
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:23,519
to the next layer for l3 and Earth to an

1489
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:26,730
r3 we see malroux

1490
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:29,130
there is abnormal behavior this is an l4

1491
01:36:26,730 --> 01:36:32,730
attack such as an Aires flood or syn

1492
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:33,619
flood it is identified and taken to the

1493
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:35,869
black

1494
01:36:33,619 --> 01:36:40,659
so that it doesn't go through the next

1495
01:36:35,869 --> 01:36:44,719
job or spot then we have another attack

1496
01:36:40,659 --> 01:36:49,190
which is not a bloomer but is actually

1497
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:53,750
trying to have an SQL injection or hhp

1498
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:58,549
attack which is l7 attack next to target

1499
01:36:53,750 --> 01:37:01,849
we jump on to the next node that is

1500
01:36:58,550 --> 01:37:04,040
management layer where we have security

1501
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:06,469
systems identifying the content and who

1502
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:08,420
wants the attacker is identify report

1503
01:37:06,469 --> 01:37:10,960
spot to the first level so the fire

1504
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:13,219
won't won't allowed that device back in

1505
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,320
so this is a firewall that it would be

1506
01:37:13,219 --> 01:37:17,690
developing as a matter of fact and so

1507
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:20,840
the next time around on this second next

1508
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:23,089
block in flow r3 will never go through

1509
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:25,460
the data channel all the way to the

1510
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:29,810
destination it will be blocked away on

1511
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:34,280
the initial step so what are we going to

1512
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:37,159
develop we will develop so we are using

1513
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:40,099
open source of where it is in our on our

1514
01:37:37,159 --> 01:37:43,400
github and there's something we're

1515
01:37:40,099 --> 01:37:48,770
working on and Laura is now in charge of

1516
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:51,259
that and it is just a standard muddler

1517
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:54,770
with advanced intelligence for traffic

1518
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:57,560
management these will be the one for the

1519
01:37:54,770 --> 01:38:00,500
firewall seeing the abnormal behaviors

1520
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:06,380
that were tracking and see what the

1521
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:09,679
attacks are this is the first layer of

1522
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:12,440
security then the next layer that will

1523
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:15,079
be developed it is loose scripting that

1524
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:19,009
is in charge of the application and once

1525
01:38:15,079 --> 01:38:22,429
the app has identified it is a l7

1526
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:25,070
attacker it will report back to NF TB

1527
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:28,219
and so the attacker will not be allowed

1528
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:30,949
through once again we work with the

1529
01:38:28,219 --> 01:38:34,040
kernel space mainly and others were we

1530
01:38:30,949 --> 01:38:36,650
were we can optimize we will also have

1531
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:39,209
an inter layer interaction and we'll

1532
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:44,219
also use kernel block in

1533
01:38:39,209 --> 01:38:47,429
event what the package leaves the board

1534
01:38:44,219 --> 01:38:51,719
and goes into the kernel the earlier we

1535
01:38:47,429 --> 01:38:53,489
managed to lock the user out less CPU

1536
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:58,949
will be used and more efficient would be

1537
01:38:53,489 --> 01:39:01,530
that circuit whose expectations attack

1538
01:38:58,949 --> 01:39:04,469
detection is costly and with this

1539
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:07,159
technology will try to use less CPU and

1540
01:39:04,469 --> 01:39:09,659
as I said before we try to identify

1541
01:39:07,159 --> 01:39:11,308
attackers in different layers because we

1542
01:39:09,659 --> 01:39:14,969
see there are different kinds of those

1543
01:39:11,309 --> 01:39:32,809
and that's all that's the proposal for

1544
01:39:14,969 --> 01:39:32,809
security unicorn

1545
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:45,049
[Music]

1546
01:39:54,290 --> 01:39:57,430
[Music]

1547
01:40:13,150 --> 01:40:17,659
but when was the earth good morning

1548
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:20,119
everyone

1549
01:40:17,659 --> 01:40:21,888
we are Jose ignacio's given on the day I

1550
01:40:20,119 --> 01:40:26,030
said la monteforte father rather and

1551
01:40:21,889 --> 01:40:29,989
myself become solid we all for work the

1552
01:40:26,030 --> 01:40:32,480
innovation department of BBVA next

1553
01:40:29,989 --> 01:40:36,739
technology and we're here to bring you

1554
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:39,799
our idea as ASAP anti shoulder surfing

1555
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:42,949
surfing attack platform that's what it

1556
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:46,489
is stands for why did we decide to focus

1557
01:40:42,949 --> 01:40:50,860
here well most of the apps and research

1558
01:40:46,489 --> 01:40:53,239
focus in other things which are mainly

1559
01:40:50,860 --> 01:40:56,059
security of system security of

1560
01:40:53,239 --> 01:41:01,030
communications through secure protocols

1561
01:40:56,060 --> 01:41:04,280
such as HTTP or encryption or else

1562
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:08,719
solving and patching up vulnerabilities

1563
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:12,710
with operating systems or problems with

1564
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:15,500
the app itself but we should like to

1565
01:41:12,710 --> 01:41:17,599
focus on the end user the end user is

1566
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:20,510
the one using the devices on a daily

1567
01:41:17,599 --> 01:41:23,510
basis and often times unaware of the

1568
01:41:20,510 --> 01:41:26,510
risks they are exposed to and in the end

1569
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:28,760
this is the weakest link we want to

1570
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:31,040
provide them with the tool that

1571
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:35,570
understands what is being done and so

1572
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:38,560
that it can be easily used so what's

1573
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:41,299
this attack the shoulder surfing attack

1574
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:44,780
when you're working in the public space

1575
01:41:41,300 --> 01:41:47,869
whether on a train or up airplane or

1576
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:50,389
even at the office and they are handling

1577
01:41:47,869 --> 01:41:54,170
sensitive information there may be

1578
01:41:50,389 --> 01:41:55,699
someone behind their shoulders what you

1579
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:56,960
know that them saying what they're doing

1580
01:41:55,699 --> 01:41:59,089
so if you're working with sensitive

1581
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:01,250
information or entering your bug

1582
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:04,070
credentials or social media credentials

1583
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:06,800
or anything that can be the last least

1584
01:42:04,070 --> 01:42:09,530
bit confidential someone behind you that

1585
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:11,810
says it has old information does it

1586
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:13,250
matter that you're using HTTPS or

1587
01:42:11,810 --> 01:42:15,909
everything else one behalf the password

1588
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,909
they are in

1589
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:24,190
so anything similar to things found one

1590
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:27,099
which is HP proprietary solution where

1591
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:29,620
on the screen there is an added layer so

1592
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:33,460
the users from a different angle from

1593
01:42:29,620 --> 01:42:37,180
the main users angle the they cannot

1594
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:39,090
probably see what's being entered on the

1595
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:42,190
screen then another solution could be

1596
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:45,160
screen savers which is just a phone on

1597
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:46,960
your device and from different sides you

1598
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:49,120
cannot see if you are sitting on a train

1599
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:51,760
the one sitting next to you cannot say

1600
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:54,370
which is good problems with these two

1601
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:57,640
solutions near Hart hood first one if

1602
01:42:54,370 --> 01:43:00,790
you don't have an HP it doesn't work ii

1603
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:03,160
want you to get this saver and you need

1604
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:03,820
to stick it properly or otherwise it is

1605
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:06,820
ruined

1606
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:09,400
who wanted software so that any user can

1607
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:12,280
have it on their device and just set it

1608
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:15,870
up and you're ready to go no sticking no

1609
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:19,120
HP what we offer is more than enough

1610
01:43:15,870 --> 01:43:22,080
what about the goals long-term goals

1611
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:24,700
would be developing an app that is

1612
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:26,830
multi-platform were running on any

1613
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:31,450
device with a webcam with a Windows Mac

1614
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:34,090
or Linux we also want to perform

1615
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:37,809
different actions if we see the attack

1616
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:40,450
is going on the user can set up what

1617
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:43,840
they want to be done such as minimizing

1618
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:46,420
the screen change in the brightness or

1619
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:49,300
luck in the computer out this is to be

1620
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:51,550
decided by the user and then we want to

1621
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:54,130
use several machine learning and

1622
01:43:51,550 --> 01:43:57,190
artificial intelligence models which can

1623
01:43:54,130 --> 01:44:00,670
be online as provided by Amazon or

1624
01:43:57,190 --> 01:44:03,969
reserve and then run them on the device

1625
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:07,210
itself as for our project we decided to

1626
01:44:03,969 --> 01:44:09,760
use web technologists because if you ask

1627
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:14,560
us that's the future we won't have focus

1628
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:18,900
on HTML all so javascript j-jason and

1629
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:22,600
also an open source library for

1630
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:24,910
artificial vision and Amazon Web

1631
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:25,720
Services for cloud services and with

1632
01:44:24,910 --> 01:44:29,120
Elektra

1633
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:34,040
we will make sure that this app is a

1634
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:37,160
multi-platform app we're bold in our

1635
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:39,710
project so we had to narrow down the

1636
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:41,960
goals in order to fit into the deadline

1637
01:44:39,710 --> 01:44:45,170
from the hackathon we want to have a

1638
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:47,930
proven concept working on Windows Mac or

1639
01:44:45,170 --> 01:44:50,230
Linux and we want to use different

1640
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:53,330
machine learning models as well as

1641
01:44:50,230 --> 01:44:58,429
artificial intelligence test cloud

1642
01:44:53,330 --> 01:45:00,830
models and also on live models and of

1643
01:44:58,430 --> 01:45:01,730
the subset of actions that we can have

1644
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:04,010
with the attack

1645
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:08,150
we wanna choose one of them and add them

1646
01:45:04,010 --> 01:45:10,340
to our app current status what we've

1647
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:15,860
done so far is checking out who that it

1648
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:18,950
is possible to make our idea real and

1649
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:21,429
we've chosen technologies but yet in the

1650
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:24,590
repository there's nothing it is empty

1651
01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:26,660
SMT as the desert and we find this is a

1652
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:29,530
good opportunity to start out and that's

1653
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:29,530
been all thank you very much

1654
01:45:32,449 --> 01:45:49,690
a local low cult housed is next

1655
01:46:03,730 --> 01:46:12,589
one of the s no more good morning

1656
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:14,900
we're here to introduce you to a knit

1657
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:17,000
step here's our hair and we David he's

1658
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:21,259
coming from a hundred I'm from Malaga

1659
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:23,540
and we've met on previous projects we

1660
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:29,680
are online gamers and we've always

1661
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:32,600
exchange ideas on security and it's the

1662
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:34,610
well it came up because of the

1663
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:37,640
information sent by our devices whether

1664
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:40,910
smartphone or laptop or a DT device on

1665
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:46,490
the MAC address whether it is balut who

1666
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:49,630
there with Wi-Fi so the information will

1667
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:54,050
be using that's it that's information

1668
01:46:49,630 --> 01:47:00,220
before the project we researcher looked

1669
01:46:54,050 --> 01:47:03,920
into the devices with random acts or

1670
01:47:00,220 --> 01:47:11,180
devices that also send the MAC address

1671
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:13,790
and so we want to use SP 32 devices

1672
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:16,910
which are a small micro controllers that

1673
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:20,210
are battery compatible and it is easier

1674
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:23,300
than doing so with any classical USB

1675
01:47:20,210 --> 01:47:25,570
parsing or using escape here or anything

1676
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:25,570
else

1677
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:31,549
scappini projects sorry and this is

1678
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:33,410
experimental this is not a system where

1679
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:35,810
the main idea would be to gather

1680
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:39,830
intelligence from people surrounding us

1681
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:43,010
but rather this is to be easily set up

1682
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:47,690
and it has to be cost-effective and done

1683
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:51,470
by anyone without significant cost and

1684
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:54,019
without a fixed system so if you want to

1685
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:57,010
move it elsewhere to device it is easily

1686
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:59,830
done and it still works

1687
01:47:57,010 --> 01:48:03,100
we also need to understand that this is

1688
01:47:59,830 --> 01:48:07,120
a passive system so that means that

1689
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:10,239
there will be no attack on the devices

1690
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:12,130
found cuz the basis for the detection of

1691
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:15,790
the system would be a black and a white

1692
01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:18,220
list so devices we believe are positive

1693
01:48:15,790 --> 01:48:21,989
or good to our network and those that

1694
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:25,770
are malicious we will not call those

1695
01:48:21,989 --> 01:48:29,259
well not malicious rather let's say that

1696
01:48:25,770 --> 01:48:31,510
we will not lock them as a black list

1697
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:34,239
but if they've registered the MAC

1698
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:37,540
address that the user they can add those

1699
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:41,830
MAC addresses to the black list as for

1700
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:47,250
similar projects I can only know Meraki

1701
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:49,930
by Cisco and well it is expensive and

1702
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:52,390
it's not an easy infrastructure to set

1703
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:55,060
up mainly because of the cost and the

1704
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:57,010
main focus is free to be my project that

1705
01:48:55,060 --> 01:49:00,720
is to be cost effective and so easily

1706
01:48:57,010 --> 01:49:04,150
implemented then there's this other idea

1707
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:06,700
was using a speed 32 because of a

1708
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:10,809
previous project where we try to use

1709
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:14,260
triangulation by using different SP

1710
01:49:10,810 --> 01:49:16,830
devices which is the ship before SP 32

1711
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:22,420
and we were covering this same

1712
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:25,480
information together with m/s m6 6 of

1713
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:27,970
connections and we decided to turn to SP

1714
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:31,330
32 because it had an embedded Bluetooth

1715
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:34,210
and this is why we used it because of

1716
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:36,309
the prize and the documents abundant on

1717
01:49:34,210 --> 01:49:38,140
the internet but mainly on the API that

1718
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:41,020
has been implemented and not so much

1719
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:45,670
this per se SDK which is the chips brand

1720
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:49,030
at that end we will be using younger the

1721
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:51,310
younger and also rest framework token

1722
01:49:49,030 --> 01:49:52,980
will be used for identification an

1723
01:49:51,310 --> 01:49:56,860
information detected will be sent

1724
01:49:52,980 --> 01:50:00,669
regularly this system will have also the

1725
01:49:56,860 --> 01:50:03,099
lists running and if the market rejected

1726
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:05,590
is malicious or not or we see that it's

1727
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:07,830
an authentication attack on the network

1728
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:10,210
there will be an alert for the user

1729
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:12,850
mostly real time so we

1730
01:50:10,210 --> 01:50:17,020
than the perimeter of the net word there

1731
01:50:12,850 --> 01:50:19,719
is an intruder and who has about to

1732
01:50:17,020 --> 01:50:21,880
explain in further detail the tests

1733
01:50:19,719 --> 01:50:27,280
we've conducted and why we've chosen at

1734
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:30,310
all time so we've got here SP 32 devices

1735
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:32,710
and we will have several spots for

1736
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:35,770
gathering information also our Raspberry

1737
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:37,690
Pi with us you have the server and

1738
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:41,560
access and have information from all the

1739
01:50:37,690 --> 01:50:43,900
espys devices with SP 32 we've run tests

1740
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:47,620
in the past we've programmed with

1741
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:50,559
arduino where we seem that is compatible

1742
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:54,930
with SP 32 but then we've sambal a pearl

1743
01:50:50,560 --> 01:51:00,010
upon memory problems trying to gather

1744
01:50:54,930 --> 01:51:03,460
Wi-Fi discovery with Bluetooth together

1745
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:07,420
and also HTTP transmission that is to be

1746
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:10,000
secured so this will be delivered as sub

1747
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:12,280
word I did at on support but we had to

1748
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:15,610
start from scratch and checking it from

1749
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:18,849
the expressive software from scratch as

1750
01:51:15,610 --> 01:51:21,580
I said with the raspberry we will be

1751
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:26,160
implemented data collection and storage

1752
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:31,540
and then also the way we manage

1753
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:35,500
information and then I will mention that

1754
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:39,610
in the next slide e SP 32 you do not

1755
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:42,280
have support from a 802 W which is for

1756
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:44,170
authentication so this is a problem

1757
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:49,509
because they can kind us after the

1758
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:53,170
transmission in our devices that's where

1759
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:55,510
we'll be running something on the

1760
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:57,880
Raspberry Pi so that it is in control of

1761
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:59,770
the authentication in the area and also

1762
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:06,130
send a warning if someone is trying to

1763
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:07,989
authenticate our own e SPS and then what

1764
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:10,960
about the software we will be producing

1765
01:52:07,989 --> 01:52:13,889
it's open source we will have it on

1766
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,240
github and that's it

1767
01:52:13,890 --> 01:52:16,330
that's me not

1768
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:18,800
[Music]

1769
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:20,809
we will be sharing other ideas we've

1770
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:22,670
seen there are so many projects and IOT

1771
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:24,830
we deal with lots of information and

1772
01:52:22,670 --> 01:52:35,300
this can be good to unify ideas thank

1773
01:52:24,830 --> 01:52:37,840
you very much one of our ethnicity

1774
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:40,790
others Pilar thank you everyone for your

1775
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:43,070
presentations as a matter of fact this

1776
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:46,250
activity when we studied it last year

1777
01:52:43,070 --> 01:52:48,230
this open public initial presentation so

1778
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:50,660
that you all the teams you are aware of

1779
01:52:48,230 --> 01:52:52,820
what they are working on others that is

1780
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:55,400
and so that you can also find potential

1781
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:58,280
synergies amounts u'b so instead of

1782
01:52:55,400 --> 01:53:00,620
having a competition we want to have

1783
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:03,440
that kind of a community where you all

1784
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:05,420
cooperate together in that regard let me

1785
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:09,830
say that when it comes to cooperation

1786
01:53:05,420 --> 01:53:12,770
you will be rewarded and it at points it

1787
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:14,990
adds to your score so you you will be

1788
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:16,460
ours reference we will be paying

1789
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:19,550
attention to you but you need to see

1790
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:21,830
your team's helped yard which teams gave

1791
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:24,920
you extra support to get out of

1792
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:27,860
obstacles and giving you some ideas so

1793
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:29,570
you need to be aware of that as well and

1794
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:34,610
then with the time that we have left

1795
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:37,190
as we said we only have limited time so

1796
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:39,320
I'll explain the rest of the standards

1797
01:53:37,190 --> 01:53:41,719
and rules have moved to the room next

1798
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:44,719
door with a hackathon and that will be

1799
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:47,300
the Q&A and the euros and the teams will

1800
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:50,420
ask questions and then you can also ask

1801
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:52,580
other teams whatever you have ideas

1802
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:55,040
comes they wait to help them with their

1803
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:56,870
projects and if someone here that might

1804
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,360
not be part of the hackathon wants to

1805
01:53:56,870 --> 01:54:02,390
come in to listen to the questions and

1806
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:07,580
to discuss some ideas they will be more

1807
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:10,550
than welcome boys damos la parte de so

1808
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:14,189
this is where we stopped

1809
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:16,889
earlier on let me remind you that during

1810
01:54:14,189 --> 01:54:20,969
the competition there will be a screen

1811
01:54:16,889 --> 01:54:23,969
with slides as reminders with

1812
01:54:20,969 --> 01:54:27,510
competition rules including the

1813
01:54:23,969 --> 01:54:30,780
repository of github from different

1814
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:33,839
teams so you can monitor that and times

1815
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:37,739
are important we told you by email that

1816
01:54:33,839 --> 01:54:39,510
we need to be very very respectful with

1817
01:54:37,739 --> 01:54:41,938
the times that we've been given in this

1818
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:45,139
room and because of that we now need to

1819
01:54:41,939 --> 01:54:49,289
go to the hackathon room to continue

1820
01:54:45,139 --> 01:54:52,039
with a Q&A session and then after that

1821
01:54:49,289 --> 01:54:56,280
we will start with the first landmark

1822
01:54:52,039 --> 01:54:59,429
for that will count for the final

1823
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:02,159
assessment for the scoring members of

1824
01:54:59,429 --> 01:55:05,609
the jury also we'll be visiting you

1825
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:09,119
regularly to ask you questions to solve

1826
01:55:05,609 --> 01:55:11,609
any doubts let me remind you as well

1827
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:15,478
that we should be stopping for lunch and

1828
01:55:11,609 --> 01:55:18,689
round about half-past two lunch will be

1829
01:55:15,479 --> 01:55:22,349
served from two up until four o'clock

1830
01:55:18,689 --> 01:55:25,139
and you can go and have your lunch more

1831
01:55:22,349 --> 01:55:27,359
or less at any time in theory but we

1832
01:55:25,139 --> 01:55:30,209
would also like to do a little bit of

1833
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:33,359
networking at lunch time so why not all

1834
01:55:30,209 --> 01:55:35,760
stop more or less at half past two we

1835
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:39,239
will be telling you partial results and

1836
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:42,989
outcomes for this first or landmark and

1837
01:55:39,239 --> 01:55:45,239
you know that the identifying code for

1838
01:55:42,989 --> 01:55:47,638
your team the hexa decimal code you've

1839
01:55:45,239 --> 01:55:51,079
been given it will be what you will see

1840
01:55:47,639 --> 01:55:54,539
for scoring tomorrow you can start

1841
01:55:51,079 --> 01:55:57,030
working at 6a although at half past

1842
01:55:54,539 --> 01:55:59,969
eleven we will have the official opening

1843
01:55:57,030 --> 01:56:02,500
or the cypher camp that you were you're

1844
01:55:59,969 --> 01:56:06,040
most welcome to attend

1845
01:56:02,500 --> 01:56:08,590
then as I said members of a jury will be

1846
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:14,640
visiting two members of the jury are

1847
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:19,440
experts at code open source code

1848
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:22,180
analysis which is time-consuming and

1849
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:27,790
members of a jury will be taking it in

1850
01:56:22,180 --> 01:56:31,240
turns to with those different roles you

1851
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:33,850
will continue to work a team work up

1852
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:37,450
until lunch time more or less a half

1853
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:39,550
past two and then also you will prepare

1854
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:42,849
to come to this room for final

1855
01:56:39,550 --> 01:56:45,160
presentations unfortunately we have very

1856
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:47,830
limited time so please make sure that

1857
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:52,440
your connections are working that it can

1858
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:56,710
all be screened and presented

1859
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:59,349
conveniently without any hiccups we will

1860
01:56:56,710 --> 01:57:03,700
have eleven minutes per minute that's

1861
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:06,100
the limitation and we would like to give

1862
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:08,050
you as much time as you need but we will

1863
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:10,420
have to be very strict we have a long

1864
01:57:08,050 --> 01:57:12,430
list of teams and we have to make sure

1865
01:57:10,420 --> 01:57:16,260
that we respect the times also thinking

1866
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:20,020
about the streaming of the activity

1867
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:23,670
round about a half past six and the jury

1868
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:28,120
will be meeting for deliberations and

1869
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:31,510
let me remind you that you have to look

1870
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:35,559
after all possible details for that to

1871
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:38,350
go ahead round about half a seven

1872
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:45,370
quarter to eight we will be publishing

1873
01:57:38,350 --> 01:57:51,000
the final results meals are organized

1874
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:51,000
here there has been a good improvement

1875
01:57:51,080 --> 01:57:59,519
lunch and tea will be served you you

1876
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:01,019
were telling us on telegram that you

1877
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,300
were a little bit concerned that you

1878
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:05,250
would go hungry well don't fret you

1879
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:08,340
won't and there will be a final

1880
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:11,640
celebration for those who survived the

1881
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:14,850
hackathon we encourage you to join in

1882
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:20,040
but that's voluntary we still don't know

1883
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:22,410
where we will be celebrating we have

1884
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:25,260
checked different possibilities for

1885
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:28,650
venue and because it's Saturday evening

1886
01:58:25,260 --> 01:58:31,320
is going to be on Saturday evening we're

1887
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:33,420
a little bit limited with that then the

1888
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:37,380
awards ceremony will be at the main

1889
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:41,090
auditorium as part of the cyber camp

1890
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:44,900
closing ceremony at 2 o'clock on Sunday

1891
01:58:41,090 --> 01:58:47,790
there will be one landmark per day

1892
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:50,700
starting today with the first one and

1893
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:54,600
for each of those landmarks at least one

1894
01:58:50,700 --> 01:59:00,090
member of your team should be there to

1895
01:58:54,600 --> 01:59:03,000
explain it to the jury your landmark the

1896
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:06,930
last landmark is number three and that's

1897
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:10,320
mostly your final presentation don't

1898
01:59:06,930 --> 01:59:12,360
worry about taking down all these notes

1899
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:16,880
because later on we will be giving you a

1900
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:21,469
sheet as a reminder and also the

1901
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:26,280
hackathon room screen will have this

1902
01:59:21,470 --> 01:59:30,360
list as a reminder again please look

1903
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:33,300
after as much detail as possible just to

1904
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:36,540
prove well you have managed your

1905
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:39,660
outcomes and for scoring the members of

1906
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:43,010
a jury their deliberations will give

1907
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:48,870
some 94 percent of your final score and

1908
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:52,130
the reminder will be depending on what

1909
01:59:48,870 --> 01:59:54,869
other teams say about you

1910
01:59:52,130 --> 01:59:57,420
we would like to ask you to please be

1911
01:59:54,869 --> 02:00:00,570
very honest with how you assess other

1912
01:59:57,420 --> 02:00:06,090
teams in previous editions and there

1913
02:00:00,570 --> 02:00:07,920
have been teams that didn't score the

1914
02:00:06,090 --> 02:00:11,789
best teams because they didn't want them

1915
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:14,130
to win so please be honest and there is

1916
02:00:11,789 --> 02:00:20,730
a collaboration bonus we've mentioned

1917
02:00:14,130 --> 02:00:22,769
before some 5% of the final score will

1918
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:28,138
come from the questions and comments

1919
02:00:22,769 --> 02:00:30,900
that you make then another 5% as well

1920
02:00:28,139 --> 02:00:36,030
will be given to you if you help other

1921
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:42,539
teams and the issues that you've solved

1922
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:47,070
for others and thus how we have

1923
02:00:42,539 --> 02:00:50,820
organized the final scoring we know who

1924
02:00:47,070 --> 02:00:54,119
will be presenting when during the last

1925
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:57,329
final presentations and then you will be

1926
02:00:54,119 --> 02:00:59,489
given the criteria you will be given a

1927
02:00:57,329 --> 02:01:03,049
sheet as a reminder as well every

1928
02:00:59,489 --> 02:01:06,329
criterion will be assessed twice and for

1929
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:18,840
landmark 3 by that time you should have

1930
02:01:06,329 --> 02:01:21,420
a functional G hub of your GUI github we

1931
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:23,400
will have different rounds as we said

1932
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:25,320
for questions and comments from the

1933
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:28,799
members of a jury and there will be

1934
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:32,549
specific tests for functionality for

1935
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:36,150
security of you to analyzing your code

1936
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:39,679
how you manage the issues that are

1937
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:44,200
opened during the process and so on

1938
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:48,070
landmark number one it has 15%

1939
02:01:44,200 --> 02:01:49,929
as the weight of the final score and

1940
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:55,170
here we can see the criteria that will

1941
02:01:49,930 --> 02:01:58,150
be assessed functionality application

1942
02:01:55,170 --> 02:02:01,120
methodology anyway this is little bit of

1943
02:01:58,150 --> 02:02:04,480
a repetition of what has already been

1944
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:06,580
said in landmark number two but we'll

1945
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:09,309
check the structure and quality of the

1946
02:02:06,580 --> 02:02:11,769
source code if it's clean easily

1947
02:02:09,310 --> 02:02:15,850
readable what type of algorithms you've

1948
02:02:11,770 --> 02:02:19,900
used your libraries how flexible your

1949
02:02:15,850 --> 02:02:28,510
options and parameters for setting it

1950
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:31,450
all up is done the command lines and how

1951
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:35,950
you manage your issues once again last

1952
02:02:31,450 --> 02:02:43,030
but not least a documentation part of

1953
02:02:35,950 --> 02:02:46,599
what will happen will depend on users

1954
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:48,550
being able to implement your tool it

1955
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:53,320
just means the instructions that you

1956
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:56,680
give the landmark number two will have

1957
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:58,210
15% weight or the final score and a

1958
02:02:56,680 --> 02:03:01,090
landmark number three seventy-five

1959
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:03,580
percent as the main one there will be a

1960
02:03:01,090 --> 02:03:06,550
round of questions as well

1961
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:11,190
and we decided to give the final

1962
02:03:06,550 --> 02:03:13,090
presentation a one extra minute

1963
02:03:11,190 --> 02:03:18,160
unfortunately because there are so many

1964
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:21,160
teams a the final deadline the final

1965
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:23,800
time sorry will be 11 minutes just

1966
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:26,110
allowing for any possible hiccups or

1967
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:29,380
technical problem said there might that

1968
02:03:26,110 --> 02:03:33,190
might occur after the last landmark

1969
02:03:29,380 --> 02:03:36,400
there will be assessment from other

1970
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:38,790
teams and the collaboration bonus once

1971
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:43,019
again the idea is that we want a

1972
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:44,720
hackathon that is truly a collaborative

1973
02:03:43,020 --> 02:03:49,590
[Music]

1974
02:03:44,720 --> 02:03:53,130
we feel that collaboration when it

1975
02:03:49,590 --> 02:03:56,340
happens it makes the most of possible

1976
02:03:53,130 --> 02:04:03,240
synergies amongst different teams and as

1977
02:03:56,340 --> 02:04:07,080
an added value now the additional 60 15

1978
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:08,099
percent of the score will come from

1979
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:11,370
questions

1980
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:13,950
partly depending on how relevant they

1981
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:18,240
are also be careful with the issues that

1982
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:21,830
you open don't just go crazy and just

1983
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:25,110
make sure they're relevant and again in

1984
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:27,740
collaboration with other teams well it

1985
02:04:25,110 --> 02:04:32,309
will depend on how relevant your

1986
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:35,490
comments or queries are some of you are

1987
02:04:32,310 --> 02:04:38,250
experts at winning competitions I'm

1988
02:04:35,490 --> 02:04:40,980
looking at antique that team now you

1989
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:48,420
will be given a professional and here we

1990
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:56,009
have the three prizes that will be given

1991
02:04:48,420 --> 02:05:00,570
a different IT hardware and also we want

1992
02:04:56,010 --> 02:05:03,540
to have different winners for those

1993
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:05,969
three so the team that has the special

1994
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:09,300
mention for students if it's one of the

1995
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:11,850
three winners and they won't be given

1996
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:14,910
that it will be given it will be awarded

1997
02:05:11,850 --> 02:05:19,050
to the following team and we want to

1998
02:05:14,910 --> 02:05:21,480
have a anonymous scoring and then that's

1999
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:29,730
why we've told you you've been given a

2000
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:31,419
hexa code so you will only see that code

2001
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:35,419
and their relative

2002
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:38,030
ranking for your team we decided to have

2003
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:40,340
that system because sometimes the

2004
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:42,679
difference in the scoring is very very

2005
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:45,770
slight and also because we don't want

2006
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:49,640
teams to be discouraged sometimes you

2007
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:51,740
might ranked sixth on the screen on the

2008
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:55,340
table but there's a very very little

2009
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:59,120
difference with yes true because I

2010
02:05:55,340 --> 02:06:02,600
remember that the team that came last

2011
02:05:59,120 --> 02:06:06,110
during the way all the time was finally

2012
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:10,010
the winner that's true and on landmark

2013
02:06:06,110 --> 02:06:16,250
one the team that scored these points

2014
02:06:10,010 --> 02:06:18,320
was finally three more points there were

2015
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:21,470
the losses that they came last at the

2016
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:24,170
end of the competition we also decided

2017
02:06:21,470 --> 02:06:26,300
to have reverse water air for the final

2018
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:29,120
presentation so we don't want the same

2019
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:33,170
team to have to break the ice both times

2020
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:36,920
here we can see the updated table for

2021
02:06:33,170 --> 02:06:40,820
the final presentations so Raul is now

2022
02:06:36,920 --> 02:06:42,950
going to give you some final messages

2023
02:06:40,820 --> 02:06:45,380
but if you have any doubts or questions

2024
02:06:42,950 --> 02:06:49,970
about the competition now is the time

2025
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:54,620
for you to ask let me insist once again

2026
02:06:49,970 --> 02:06:57,770
that for us collaboration is key and we

2027
02:06:54,620 --> 02:07:00,410
also want the jury not just to be there

2028
02:06:57,770 --> 02:07:03,200
to assess the teams but also and to

2029
02:07:00,410 --> 02:07:06,620
answer questions and eat down so you may

2030
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:09,650
have please ask them for guidance don't

2031
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:11,780
think the jury is your enemy but one

2032
02:07:09,650 --> 02:07:14,059
more ally or partner for you any

2033
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:16,190
questions or comments know about the

2034
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:21,470
competition or is everything crystal

2035
02:07:16,190 --> 02:07:26,419
clear again if you have questions later

2036
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:30,430
on and just fire fire them let me

2037
02:07:26,420 --> 02:07:30,430
continue now with some practical message

2038
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:39,728
look at the screen that's the resolution

2039
02:07:35,579 --> 02:07:43,360
that we will have unfortunately you know

2040
02:07:39,729 --> 02:07:47,099
that letter type the size of the font

2041
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:51,009
will be key and Oscar reminded us

2042
02:07:47,099 --> 02:07:54,519
yesterday we have warned you on telegram

2043
02:07:51,010 --> 02:07:59,889
in our messages and Monica said that

2044
02:07:54,519 --> 02:08:01,780
time will be fundamental the this

2045
02:07:59,889 --> 02:08:04,479
presentation has been six minutes but

2046
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:08,309
the final presentation will be 11

2047
02:08:04,479 --> 02:08:10,989
minutes and you're going to have to be

2048
02:08:08,309 --> 02:08:15,789
totally independent with your own

2049
02:08:10,989 --> 02:08:18,638
computer with virtual machines so you

2050
02:08:15,789 --> 02:08:21,550
can run tit demo that's quite risky so

2051
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:27,579
please test everything check that it

2052
02:08:21,550 --> 02:08:30,420
working on this room will use right that

2053
02:08:27,579 --> 02:08:30,420
HDMI

2054
02:08:32,749 --> 02:08:42,769
the final presentations will be at 2 or

2055
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:46,339
2 o'clock on the last day yeah please be

2056
02:08:42,769 --> 02:08:49,610
real professionals and check the

2057
02:08:46,340 --> 02:08:52,190
presentations beforehand don't leave it

2058
02:08:49,610 --> 02:08:54,380
for the last minute and think that your

2059
02:08:52,190 --> 02:08:57,079
audience is going to have to sit and

2060
02:08:54,380 --> 02:08:59,780
wait for you make sure that you come

2061
02:08:57,079 --> 02:09:02,570
nice and early check that everything is

2062
02:08:59,780 --> 02:09:04,909
working and then ok something might go

2063
02:09:02,570 --> 02:09:07,308
wrong at the end of the day but it won't

2064
02:09:04,909 --> 02:09:09,400
be because you didn't check it those of

2065
02:09:07,309 --> 02:09:12,559
you who will be using their mouths

2066
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:15,920
virtual machines with hardware with

2067
02:09:12,559 --> 02:09:19,760
Arduino Arduino and so on

2068
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:22,909
please remember that space will be

2069
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:25,880
limited and make sure that there will be

2070
02:09:22,909 --> 02:09:28,098
room for everything collaboration

2071
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:30,739
amongst different teams will be

2072
02:09:28,099 --> 02:09:32,630
important for instance for Wi-Fi heat

2073
02:09:30,739 --> 02:09:36,320
map some of you will be working with

2074
02:09:32,630 --> 02:09:39,909
different areas and about the source

2075
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:44,360
code so that it can be assessed

2076
02:09:39,909 --> 02:09:49,699
regularly but please lay up load it and

2077
02:09:44,360 --> 02:09:52,969
regularly even if it's not the final

2078
02:09:49,699 --> 02:09:56,928
version please don't leave it until the

2079
02:09:52,969 --> 02:10:00,229
last minute until landmark number 2

2080
02:09:56,929 --> 02:10:04,179
starts please make sure that you upload

2081
02:10:00,229 --> 02:10:04,179
it so we can start checking

2082
02:10:07,610 --> 02:10:15,150
for those of you who will be uploading

2083
02:10:10,950 --> 02:10:17,910
to the cloud I think for the demo on the

2084
02:10:15,150 --> 02:10:21,540
last day if it were me I would come with

2085
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:25,410
my own equipment with my own system

2086
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:28,500
today we've all been using the same pc

2087
02:10:25,410 --> 02:10:30,360
but i think that that won't be best for

2088
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:39,780
the last day make sure that you have

2089
02:10:30,360 --> 02:10:41,429
aged DMI vga for visuals just make sure

2090
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:43,969
that you have everything ready and you

2091
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:47,190
can test it or even you should test it

2092
02:10:43,970 --> 02:10:49,980
you will have a 11 minutes for the final

2093
02:10:47,190 --> 02:10:53,460
presentation and one image is worth a

2094
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:58,139
1000 words so don't leave too much time

2095
02:10:53,460 --> 02:11:00,450
for slides for general explanations oops

2096
02:10:58,140 --> 02:11:03,540
we're being reminded that we need to

2097
02:11:00,450 --> 02:11:06,480
leave the room we need to set a good

2098
02:11:03,540 --> 02:11:08,190
example be good role models so let's

2099
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:09,929
respect that and go to the hackathon

2100
02:11:08,190 --> 02:11:11,960
room enjoy

2101
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:12,440
[Applause]

2102
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:20,799
