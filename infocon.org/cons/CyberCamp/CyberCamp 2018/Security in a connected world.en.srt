2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:18,310
okay then we wanna see asset dollars

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:21,729
good morning welcome back and after

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:23,619
preparing all the technical part of the

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,230
coming presentation we're ready to

6
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:30,730
welcome you to our new edition of cyber

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:40,470
camp 2018 you know that we are on

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:44,470
twitter at at in CB cyber camp 2018 and

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:49,690
also with our hashtag sorry 18 only not

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:54,000
2018 and let me introduce you now to our

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:58,059
census a co-founder of elephant hacking

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,059
he's here to tell us about a security in

13
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:04,360
a connected world I'm sure we will all

14
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:07,509
thoroughly enjoy this and I will welcome

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:16,660
him with a warm round of applause thank

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:19,930
you very much welcome good morning

17
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:23,350
everyone and apologies for the slight

18
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,480
technical hiccup let's start with a

19
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,210
little bit of imagination can you

20
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,830
imagine if we could get into our car

21
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:35,380
without even having a key can you

22
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,450
imagine if we could drive on the

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:42,850
motorway and we don't need to stop and

24
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:45,610
pay can you imagine if we could go home

25
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,869
and open the door without the need for a

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:52,990
key can you imagine if we could travel

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:56,110
and use public transport without having

28
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:58,690
to pay physically pay so let's stop

29
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,870
imagining now and let's see let's see

30
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:05,110
the demo of how this can all actually

31
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:07,030
work that's what we're going to be doing

32
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:10,820
this morning

33
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:13,760
although a word of warning we need to be

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:19,840
ever so careful because we're going to

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:23,859
be seeing different situations which are

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,450
demonstrations and is this reality well

37
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,360
later on you will tell me if it is just

38
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:35,000
a figment of my imagination of or if

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:38,180
it's reality as it is this is me growl

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,170
Sanchez you can see up on the screen and

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:48,050
how a co-founder of a start-up elephant

42
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:52,880
hacking we haven't been up and running

43
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:58,490
for a long time I love notes and ones

44
00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:03,470
and hardware analysis reversing but

45
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:07,940
mostly I work with hardware we work at

46
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:13,430
very low level with assembler and a C

47
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:16,340
code well code writing on C then I also

48
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,430
we also help people with a higher level

49
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,580
activities but I mostly work with

50
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,140
hardware hacking this is the table of

51
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,130
contents that I would like to cover

52
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:32,779
during my workshop this morning let's

53
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:34,150
hope we have time to cover it all it's

54
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:40,220
not going to be very practical

55
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:45,590
activities will start with copying a car

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:47,900
key so we can use the car without the

57
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,650
need for a key we won't actually be

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,200
starting it physically but if you access

59
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,590
the internet you will see explanations

60
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,899
on how that would work we'll just be

61
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:03,230
using the key to open the door as it is

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:08,660
not to start the engine the second

63
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:14,170
activity will be going through the toll

64
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:17,300
booth without paying

65
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:20,690
for the barrier to lift and letters

66
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:23,320
through the toll booth area without

67
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,320
paying

68
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,690
then how to break into a house without

69
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,110
having to break in just opening the door

70
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,940
without the alarms going off because I

71
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,450
don't think alarms are that safe these

72
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:47,110
days which is why I've prepared this

73
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:49,780
presentation sometimes we're told alarm

74
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:53,740
systems are ever so safe while they're

75
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:56,830
not and you'll see how they're not the

76
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:01,900
next activity will have to do with

77
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:07,539
hotels how we could gain control to all

78
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:12,400
the technical devices and possibilities

79
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:20,130
at a hotel then we will see ISO seven

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:26,580
eight one six the cards how they work

81
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:31,510
and last but not least we'll see how an

82
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:32,919
NFC card for a public transport voucher

83
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:39,010
or card

84
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:41,650
it can be used a bus pass and don't

85
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,140
misunderstand me I'm telling you how

86
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:48,789
these cards these bus passes can be

87
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:51,610
copied a not for you to cheat but for

88
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:54,940
public transport operators to realize

89
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,090
that the system is not that safe well if

90
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:02,530
they want to listen to us who tell them

91
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:05,530
about this and finally we will have a

92
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,919
nice cup of coffee without having to pay

93
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:13,030
for it a getting coffee at a vending

94
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:18,430
machine because their their systems

95
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:22,989
again are not terribly safe so how did

96
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:25,510
this all start why do I want to do this

97
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,770
I want us to think this is like a

98
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:33,180
journey I left home a few days ago to

99
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,180
come to cyber camp

100
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,490
staying in Malaga for a number of days I

101
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:44,750
staying at a hotel and this is not

102
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:47,210
imaginary right it is all real for

103
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,880
instance when I tell you about the hotel

104
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:56,260
card it will be a real situation so I

105
00:06:49,880 --> 00:07:02,210
left home I came by car here to Malaga I

106
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:06,440
didn't steal the car but I I needed a

107
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:09,280
key to open the car door so again is

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:14,990
that a safe system we'll see it's not

109
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:20,059
again to get here and I drove on the

110
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:23,270
motorway I had to pay for it but I will

111
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,750
show you how barriers can just let me

112
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,039
through

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:34,460
without having to pay and because I'm

114
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:36,290
very short of cash then I thought well

115
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,650
why not

116
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:47,800
get into a house instead of staying at a

117
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:52,940
hotel get in because nobody's in and

118
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:55,360
gaining access and without a very

119
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:59,930
well-known alarm brand

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,960
stopping me from doing it then at the

121
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:07,400
hotel there is something that's called a

122
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,370
must card or a master key that again

123
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:15,370
gives access to all their systems I will

124
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:23,390
see how security at a hotel is not as

125
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:25,310
foolproof as we might imagine and you

126
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:29,360
never know right if one of your guests

127
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:32,839
is going to be a clever hacker or some

128
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,110
other guest might come into my room do

129
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:40,789
whatever he or she feels like doing it

130
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:42,539
or things is fun to do again the bus

131
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:46,540
pass

132
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:52,290
it's a nice idea right having a little

133
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:57,269
tour around Malaga on the bus caching

134
00:08:52,290 --> 00:09:02,649
different buses and using a bus pass

135
00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:06,669
that is not real the machine lets you

136
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:09,069
through it clicks quite normally it's

137
00:09:06,669 --> 00:09:10,720
quite amazing and then I just want to

138
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:15,009
tell you that at the company we

139
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:19,119
sometimes in audit companies and what I

140
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:21,160
tend to do is launching Nexus first and

141
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:24,100
because it takes a little while for it

142
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:27,339
all to work I go for a little walk

143
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:31,749
around the building around the premises

144
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:34,989
I go with my gadgets and I love anything

145
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:39,009
that has to do with industrial equipment

146
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:44,249
for instance lighting demotic lighting

147
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:47,470
control or heat heating and air

148
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:50,769
conditioning if that works through

149
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:53,739
domotics as well and also vending

150
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:56,949
machines I've always liked checking and

151
00:09:53,739 --> 00:10:00,879
seeing how safe vending machines are or

152
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:04,179
how not safe sorry how secure their

153
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:09,579
system is I'm trying to get a cup of

154
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:13,619
coffee for free well I'll be telling you

155
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:15,669
how it can be done with the idea that

156
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:18,100
hopefully for instance the vending

157
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:21,069
machine manufacturers will listen to us

158
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,889
and improve their systems that's the

159
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:26,199
idea that's why I talk to companies and

160
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:30,759
give them advice although I must tell

161
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:32,799
you they rarely listen to the advice I

162
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:35,079
give them why not

163
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,649
I guess because there are not many

164
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:41,649
people who are sensitive to these issues

165
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:45,579
and all they think is not going to be

166
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:47,829
that harmful so this is the tour the

167
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,868
little journey I propose to you here

168
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:54,829
today for our workshop I hope you enjoy

169
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:57,540
the tour let's start with a car team

170
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,140
where's my car key I don't know what

171
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,140
I've done with it

172
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:06,599
well I've got the key believe me but I

173
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,610
can't see it now I've got a control a

174
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,910
remote control here as well so just as

175
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:16,830
well this is a very simple attack you

176
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:22,709
just get a quirky just see how simple it

177
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:25,590
is practically anybody can do it as long

178
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:29,460
as you have the correct equipment and

179
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:31,200
systems so how can you copy a car key we

180
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,910
first need to understand how the key

181
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:41,100
works all it does is with an internal

182
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:43,980
algorithm it sends a unique code to the

183
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,910
vehicle you press your opening button

184
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:52,820
and it sends this unique code to the car

185
00:11:47,910 --> 00:12:00,630
and if it coincides with the individual

186
00:11:52,820 --> 00:12:02,760
encoded algorithm if they coincide if

187
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:08,340
it's the same then the door will open

188
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:10,890
and if it doesn't it won't but controls

189
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,990
car controls are peculiar because every

190
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,260
time you press the button it generates a

191
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,300
code that's valid for that car that code

192
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,870
gets to the car and the door opens

193
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:29,459
that's the system force can we do in

194
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:35,040
this case we would be very very close to

195
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:41,670
the remote control quite close so we

196
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:44,370
then start to listen and sniff and when

197
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,089
somebody presses the button the door

198
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,130
will open

199
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:52,530
that's it sounds easy right well it is

200
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,330
but it's a little bit harder because the

201
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:58,020
code is valid the first time around

202
00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:01,140
and then it's invalidated it changes

203
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:04,829
even if you send the same code again it

204
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:08,330
won't be valid the car won't accept it

205
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,330
it won't record

206
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:17,810
how can we copy the code you need to

207
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:23,089
have a device in the middle so that the

208
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:25,880
code when the opening button is pressed

209
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:30,560
it won't get to the car it will get to

210
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,480
us instead the car doesn't know that the

211
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,910
button has been pressed but now we've

212
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:40,760
got the code so the car owner presses

213
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,270
the button and they think oh that's

214
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,510
funny

215
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:47,319
it didn't open but it's a

216
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:50,660
man-in-the-middle attack the usual

217
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,030
simple man-in-the-middle attack all you

218
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:57,860
need to do is be close to the remote

219
00:13:53,030 --> 00:14:01,370
control and get the code whoops the

220
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,410
screens not working the mic is working

221
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:15,950
right and another smaller screens

222
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:19,550
working is somebody hacking my

223
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:22,570
presentation or was I thought it was

224
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:26,599
going to be an interesting workshop I

225
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:29,750
don't know if the technical staff can

226
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,460
give me a hand with this the smaller

227
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,460
screens are not working either Wow

228
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,740
Elda me Selena

229
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:54,390
no no no bono come in Taba look I got

230
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,180
fed up on a sham with Erica we don't

231
00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:01,500
cook so as I said a simple system you

232
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:05,209
stand close to the remote control you

233
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:08,100
get the valid code and the car doesn't

234
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:12,869
so the court doesn't know the code has

235
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:20,300
been sent the first time round it gets

236
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:27,110
it second time around so we then have to

237
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:30,420
wait for the car owner not to be nearby

238
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:35,370
must best isn't it and we would then

239
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:38,069
send the code to the car and the door

240
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:42,029
will open because the car will think

241
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:45,089
it's the proper key sending the code so

242
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:47,630
shall we see this for real I couldn't

243
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:51,089
get a car into the room unfortunately

244
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:55,560
first I've brought something that will

245
00:15:51,089 --> 00:16:02,930
work in a similar way let me try and

246
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:02,930
find the battery I brought a doorbell

247
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:24,540
here's my doorbell for our clever

248
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:29,640
practical example a wireless doorbell

249
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,300
that you can buy at any old Poundland

250
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,760
shop

251
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:37,819
can you hear I press my remote control

252
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,819
and the doorbell sounds

253
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:43,459
so let me change to the through the

254
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,459
other screen now

255
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:06,740
if anybody here knows very much how

256
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,629
radio frequency spectrum works the RF

257
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,189
range

258
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:20,260
this is SDR it's a little bit more

259
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:20,260
powerful than the usual smaller versions

260
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:32,809
this is a TD T USB that has been

261
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:39,200
modified so that because T DT is UHF

262
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:46,070
mode it allows you to sniff a little bit

263
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:49,520
beyond the band the UHF UHF band in this

264
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:57,020
case I've brought one from two to six

265
00:17:49,520 --> 00:18:02,658
megahertz from 2 to 6 2 from 2 megahertz

266
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:06,530
to 6 gigahertz originally I thought it

267
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:07,909
was 443 merc megahertz look at this I

268
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,030
pressed the control

269
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:14,120
I want the right band but nothing much

270
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:18,379
is happening why because I bought it at

271
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:21,860
a cheap shot like a Poundland and I

272
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:25,399
thought why is this not working I was a

273
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:33,639
little bit confused and funnily enough

274
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:38,059
these cheap bazaars tend to send cell

275
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:41,360
chinese-manufactured equipment which the

276
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:44,658
transmission in that case they use the

277
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,689
chinese frequency not the european one

278
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:49,789
which is three hundred and thirty let me

279
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:56,350
change that then see if that works

280
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:56,350
it needs to be at 330 330

281
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:04,049
there it is can you see it look at the

282
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:06,870
graph oh dear it's taking a little bit

283
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:10,860
longer than it should I hope the battery

284
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:19,379
it doesn't give up on me

285
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:23,219
right a 336 you see it's working when I

286
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:27,660
press the remote control he's not very

287
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:30,210
very stable I'm not going to say it

288
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,970
again well in fact this cheap shop where

289
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,700
I bought this remote control it was run

290
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:41,030
by a Chinese family and I have nothing

291
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:44,669
against China or the Chinese people but

292
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:47,160
they're not always very reliable why is

293
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:53,690
this working God knows I mean he might

294
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:57,690
just be sheer luck so we're lucky it's

295
00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:04,559
working that's something so it's a 332

296
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:09,590
now what is quite fragile it's not very

297
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:13,770
stable mine is round about 332 then

298
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:17,970
we've got that now oh I forgot to

299
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:22,970
explain this little program to you how

300
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:27,240
it works what it does is sniffing a on

301
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:31,650
different a number of different pants

302
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:34,169
because the electromagnetic range has

303
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:36,360
different pants we can then change the

304
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:39,540
frequency thanks to this program the

305
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,928
modulation a number of different things

306
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:45,299
but in this particular example we don't

307
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:50,750
care about out about that we just need

308
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:54,230
to copy and reproduce this the signal

309
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,230
let's do that then

310
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,130
now the lead of the interpreter liberal

311
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:12,530
smoke I've got this utility from the

312
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:17,060
mohkum books project said transfer one

313
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:21,770
and it gives us all different options -

314
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:26,929
are allows to receive a data with - T we

315
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:30,110
it transmits or broadcast data then we

316
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:32,150
can add modulation and pain because

317
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:36,560
while pain will be important because the

318
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:40,370
battery is a bit low with - F for

319
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:47,389
frequency so - are for receiving that's

320
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:50,080
what we'll do to start off with I'm just

321
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,080
going to check

322
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,840
step is adding the frequency I forgot

323
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:09,090
what it was

324
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:09,090
446 was it 300 well thank you it was 336

325
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:18,510
sorry I've got a rubbish memory

326
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:27,919
all I want to show you is how it can

327
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:32,770
reproduce you can copy but this is not

328
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:37,820
the most interesting step not yet

329
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:46,639
333 was this point something

330
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:50,840
is that the one 333 point 3 5 because it

331
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:55,580
goes up and down it varies it's not very

332
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:57,790
stable let's hope it works first time

333
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,790
round

334
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:09,100
this is the command - or for receiving

335
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:17,590
data you see what it does the program

336
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:21,748
saves saves it on a route file if this

337
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:27,029
were music it would be like waa peace

338
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:31,090
saving notes and ones anything it gets

339
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:34,600
without a zipping is and then with we'll

340
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:38,649
have to do - tea but we're on - are now

341
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:43,959
we now add the frequency it's saving is

342
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:45,119
I now press the button I stop and if it

343
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:52,029
works

344
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:53,918
the Bell is here you see Bell 1 how much

345
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:57,360
that does that take it

346
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:01,629
it's got 90 makers yep

347
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:05,258
that's the size 90 makers in just three

348
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:07,629
seconds that's pretty good going so

349
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:11,049
without touching the control I'm now

350
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:16,719
going to try and broadcast the very same

351
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:22,029
signal we go to hack RF we look at the

352
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:28,179
parameters - D is for broadcasting so

353
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:32,379
that's the one we press - t we transfer

354
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:37,889
the file Bell and then we add the gain

355
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:41,649
on DB's what is that going to be 20 DBS

356
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:48,100
20 decibels and if the frequency was

357
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:51,518
correct when I press it will reproduce

358
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:54,840
they will play you will ring does it no

359
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:58,720
it doesn't why because their frequency

360
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,749
varies is not very stable but if I get

361
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,350
the exact right frequency let me just

362
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:08,530
try that again

363
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:13,270
here in right in the middle of the curve

364
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:15,410
so that I get the best average accurate

365
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:21,350
frequency three hundred and thirty six

366
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:25,600
point four five now you see is changed

367
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:28,909
because it was point three earlier on

368
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,918
again it's a very unstable frequency for

369
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,780
this particular doorbell so three

370
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,830
hundred and thirty six point four five

371
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:43,970
we said let me try that again

372
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:53,360
three three three right so I save the

373
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:56,330
bell and then I press play with 333.50

374
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,809
with a gain of 20 DBS there you go I

375
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,490
didn't even have to press the button I

376
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:12,049
didn't cheat and the control is here and

377
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:13,580
is ringing right that was a very simple

378
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:18,350
task yeah we're going to do that

379
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:21,980
something more complex next basically is

380
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:26,539
the same idea but in this case the

381
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:28,789
frequency is going to be for a car let's

382
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:31,460
hope it works this is a remote control

383
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:33,260
car a little toy car I'm gonna leave it

384
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:39,260
on the floor because otherwise it might

385
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:42,710
just my drop is I'm going to find the

386
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:45,770
frequency for the accelerator see the

387
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:49,039
composition of the frequency so that we

388
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:53,629
can then generate it from scratch

389
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:56,480
without reproducing it as we did earlier

390
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:58,900
but rather through modulation of the

391
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,260
signal coming out of the control

392
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:05,450
modulated a with the frequency

393
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:07,020
transmitter that's what we'll try and do

394
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:11,010
next

395
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:16,080
I don't know if you're familiar with the

396
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:23,300
Osmo comb project it's called pen source

397
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,300
jinwu jinwu radio G and you radio sorry

398
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:43,350
yeah tenemos right we're going I'm going

399
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:47,280
to do this so you can see it up on the

400
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:50,340
screen visually generating the signal

401
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:53,850
checking the modulation so that we can

402
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:58,889
then generate it again with all

403
00:27:53,850 --> 00:28:02,159
necessary functions everything we need

404
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:05,130
air for the signal to be generated from

405
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,010
scratch as I said I'm going to turn the

406
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:12,390
car off first because otherwise it's

407
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:13,260
just going to go mad so what should we

408
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:17,960
do first

409
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:20,879
are you familiar with radio frequency

410
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,760
with all the details it's not that

411
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,860
complex it is a little bit at the

412
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,200
beginning until you understand

413
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:32,129
everything that has to do with

414
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:40,230
modulation you understand how signals

415
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:42,170
are made up through different very basic

416
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:45,420
functions some of them some of them

417
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:48,120
terribly complex all of that is done on

418
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:51,000
Python by the way so you could even

419
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,449
prepare your own modules there are

420
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,350
plugins so if you want to work with your

421
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:01,740
own module you can prepare it yourself

422
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:06,980
but it's not really required most

423
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:09,150
modulations you can guess as a plugin

424
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:12,210
unless you come across a particular

425
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:15,660
situation which doesn't comply with the

426
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:19,630
normal standards or where you want to

427
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:22,480
have it imagine your own unique

428
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:24,700
mission of broadcast that nobody would

429
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,370
be able to sniff in that situation then

430
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:30,250
you might want to make your own which is

431
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:32,760
not simple but it can be done for

432
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:37,600
instance in the military

433
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:41,320
there are modulations that are no more

434
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,889
for them but complete unknowns for

435
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:49,629
anybody else you could even crack those

436
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:55,030
with something like this and all is done

437
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:58,750
here on this so we get the remote

438
00:29:55,030 --> 00:30:05,440
control we check the frequency for that

439
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:08,410
transmission the aerial is getting the

440
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:13,800
signal from the remote control we press

441
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:18,430
forward is not 336 or 400 megahertz

442
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:22,120
because 333 I forgot to mention that it

443
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:26,080
it's the American Standard which is the

444
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:28,929
one that they use in China as well not

445
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,899
in Europe so this would be a legal bail

446
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:34,930
for the US and China but not for Europe

447
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:40,480
but in this case there's another free

448
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:46,300
frequency 27 megahertz there's quite a

449
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:48,550
bit of noise there so 27 there it is so

450
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,520
we're already receiving something what

451
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:53,919
is it is noise so it's not going to be

452
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,560
very clean I don't know if it's going to

453
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:00,250
work very well I don't know if there

454
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:02,230
will be some something transmitting on

455
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:05,830
this frequency because you don't need a

456
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:09,340
license to broadcast or transmit on

457
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:15,760
these licenses is open and free look at

458
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:17,840
that huge peak there at 27 4.3 on that

459
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:30,090
band

460
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:32,820
27-point what not 3-5 look at it see

461
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:38,480
those frequencies there see how we have

462
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:42,480
that horizontal line not would equate to

463
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,320
zero that would be our zero and what

464
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,549
else we've got those tiny waves

465
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:55,639
oscillating stopping going up and down

466
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:58,799
those wavelets that's an AM type

467
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:03,840
modulation there's I know I do

468
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,500
wave stretches and then goes narrower

469
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,490
again

470
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:12,000
why because we first have zero without

471
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:18,179
any oscillation then one would mean a

472
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,500
tiny pulse of two tiny synovial wavelets

473
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:27,809
and then depending on the width of the

474
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:30,210
pulse and that would mean is 0 or 1 it

475
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:33,178
depends on the width I insist of the

476
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:36,179
pulse if it's a very small pulse and

477
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:39,179
that would equate to 1 oops sorry the

478
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:41,640
speaker corrects himself if it's tiny is

479
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:46,280
would be a zero if it's wider it would

480
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,280
equate to 1

481
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:59,540
so how can we generate those larger and

482
00:32:54,170 --> 00:33:02,570
smaller forces so we said 27 not 35

483
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:05,510
don't let me forget that I'm just gonna

484
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:15,530
write it down or type it here because

485
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:20,810
otherwise I'll forget so we will now be

486
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:25,370
generating larger or smaller pulses for

487
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:29,560
notes or ones depending on the remote

488
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:31,939
control for instance it might be 1 1 0

489
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:35,330
you'll see what I mean in a minute on

490
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:38,870
the left not not one for instance on the

491
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:39,439
right whatever it says and what does

492
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,679
that do

493
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:47,420
well sending four different commands

494
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,220
through an analog means which is radio

495
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:52,580
frequency

496
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:56,150
so let's first check what poses this

497
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,909
remote control actually broadcasts or

498
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:03,740
transmits we need first need to find the

499
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:08,150
block osmocon source what does that

500
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:10,030
block to connect up to my radio

501
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:13,610
frequency reader

502
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:17,680
the driver is ready so that through the

503
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:21,550
USB port communication is possible then

504
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,389
with the radio frequency transmitter

505
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:26,480
tx/rx

506
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:28,819
what does that mean that smaller ones

507
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,130
that would cost you 10 euros I can't

508
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:34,100
transmit they would only receive in this

509
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:38,900
case a a can both transmit or broadcast

510
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:44,810
and receive but if we have an SDR USB

511
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:47,330
the typical one for TDT devices we could

512
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:50,440
do the first part of this exercise but

513
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:53,000
we wouldn't be able to transmit the code

514
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,510
sending the command to the car so that

515
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,490
the car would start as if by magic we

516
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:04,180
wouldn't be able to do that second part

517
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:08,450
so what do we do first we first need to

518
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:11,540
enter the number of poses divided what

519
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:16,879
poses per million that I get from that

520
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:21,200
signal an analog signal which is endless

521
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:24,980
as actually as many spots or points as

522
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:28,129
the accuracy of our device in order to

523
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:31,849
measure those pulses so an analog signal

524
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:34,670
would oxalate sorry a sine wave moves

525
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:37,550
from a zero and it gives up salayheen

526
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:41,630
all the way back to zero so zero one two

527
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:44,330
three four - well whenever we are tired

528
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:46,099
of measuring arrests how is our device

529
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:50,720
can measure and then back to zero and

530
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:53,119
that number of pulses that we have from

531
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,589
the first zero to the second zero that

532
00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:00,880
number of pulses is what we can set here

533
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:03,950
we will say 20 million pulses per second

534
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:10,520
20 million times within a second I'll

535
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:14,000
measure that sine wave so from the first

536
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,609
zero to the second zero I'll measure the

537
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,890
wave 20 million times per second so I

538
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:21,380
will be suppling sampling at a rate of

539
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,900
20 million times per second that's what

540
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:27,230
I meant to say it's a sampling it seems

541
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:30,380
quite high but some are as high as a

542
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:33,080
hundred million or a very steep

543
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,280
resolution ours works great at twenty

544
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,609
million and is more than enough

545
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:40,730
especially for what we have here is more

546
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:49,220
than enough we don't need an higher

547
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:54,040
resolution all right so it's 2 times 2

548
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,040
to the 6th power I said 20 million

549
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:08,780
so we have a variable here we have this

550
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,590
central frequency that's our frequency

551
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,590
that's a variable

552
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,559
which we would name central frequency

553
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:25,520
that's the reference for our remote that

554
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:31,050
we will be recording or saving this is

555
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:33,180
270 356 98 I copy that so it's better

556
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:41,190
than learning it by heart so we better

557
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:49,980
copy-paste it so it's 27 megahertz so 27

558
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:52,920
million 1 2 3 1 2 3 so 27 million Oh 9 8

559
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:57,109
that's the central frequency that wood

560
00:37:52,920 --> 00:38:00,990
will be reading not writing but reading

561
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:04,950
wood will be sent by these remote so

562
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:15,390
what we do next is try and find the

563
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:17,970
module here this is FFT tester and it

564
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:21,779
shows right away what is being read by

565
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:24,058
our reader RF reader it shows on the

566
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,730
screen a fizzes whereas Silla scope and

567
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:28,200
it shows as a graph that's been sampled

568
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:30,119
and that's what's important here and we

569
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,390
all need to understand that is 2 million

570
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:39,510
as I said before resolution is 2 million

571
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:42,328
pulses samples per second so in a minute

572
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:45,299
and we will see it moving fast but at

573
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:47,339
least we can see it we can even freeze

574
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:49,609
it to see how it is transmitted in and

575
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:55,140
we'll say that as well what we do here

576
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:57,509
with this module is a spectral analysis

577
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,400
so we look into the range or the

578
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:03,710
spectrum in the frequency we've stated

579
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:08,790
which is 27 megahertz to see our remote

580
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:11,540
alright as I said before we need a

581
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,540
reference frequency

582
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:20,710
which we've said is Center all right

583
00:39:35,619 --> 00:39:43,749
so this is our base frequency our sample

584
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:50,769
frequency you already done it so that's

585
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:54,700
it so we take our input that is our F

586
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:57,419
and this is our spectral analyzer and

587
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,419
just like that

588
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:16,869
so if we press play always F did same as

589
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:22,140
before but now with our frequency which

590
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:22,140
is 27 megahertz so if I press it here oh

591
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:37,420
all right so you cannot see did it get

592
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:42,118
the right one yeah yeah so 2703 five six

593
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:49,119
nine eight all right guys like that

594
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:53,430
that's the frequency as it moves but

595
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,940
let's handle it now and let's change it

596
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:59,499
and we'll see a few more parameters

597
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,210
these was the Freak that central

598
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:04,649
frequency let's try and see how we can

599
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,769
add the pulse modulation

600
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:07,769
[Music]

601
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:26,430
using our own module here it is alright

602
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:35,510
this is our sampling frequency so what

603
00:41:31,339 --> 00:41:37,250
we do is plug this into this or link

604
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,010
this T and we have some extra

605
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:44,750
information so we have both in parallel

606
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:53,359
so this is an output here and right here

607
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:54,799
we have the output underneath I know

608
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,940
whether it's the battery is our watch

609
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:57,940
but there's something right here

610
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:12,810
oops I guess it'll work now what that's

611
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,890
like that for the first half of it we

612
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:21,480
would get our reference frequency and

613
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:26,210
what we do next is save it on our word

614
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:30,080
drive with the new module that I'll add

615
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,080
which is this one here

616
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:55,460
so let's name it I don't know we mode

617
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,450
speed up

618
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:30,530
well this is not compatible because we

619
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:32,830
need to translate it into float all

620
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,830
right

621
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:52,310
okay so what we do here is when we turn

622
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:55,130
this signal that is a complex signal

623
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:58,040
into float as you probably know a

624
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:01,640
complex signal has a mixture of

625
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,740
frequencies that we rule out or discard

626
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,470
what's the imaginary side of it so we

627
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:12,549
only live the out but we forget about

628
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:12,549
everything else okay

629
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:54,830
manuela Corsa okay no bless him

630
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:15,279
our ice to see

631
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:22,589
when digital filter and they think

632
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:31,619
she'll ever posted oh yeah that's what

633
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:33,359
we had written right 27 35 27 old 35

634
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:38,030
well it does work

635
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,029
Oh again we forgot about that

636
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:53,850
maybe we were not getting the right gain

637
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,850
here

638
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:14,340
now it's not working as an emergency kit

639
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:15,330
I always get soaked when I recorded it

640
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,190
when I saved it

641
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:20,040
that was yesterday that I was checking

642
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:24,570
it out the frequency was twenty seven

643
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:26,580
three one four I don't know what the

644
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,680
difference might be let's try the one

645
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,759
that I saved yesterday and see if it

646
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:33,299
works

647
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:37,770
oh it does work twenty seven three one

648
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:40,320
four so let's use the one that I

649
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:48,710
recorded si because for whatever the

650
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:55,190
reason alright so here what we have is

651
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:55,190
well you can see it now Kenji

652
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:11,650
so here we have the wave coming in but

653
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:11,650
we'll see what kind of a wave it is

654
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:35,430
that's what we've seen before this is a

655
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:38,470
wave so what's here is interesting so

656
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:43,690
this is a wide pulse and other white

657
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:48,100
pals are smaller pals another one this

658
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:52,900
is small so if we think that the wide

659
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:55,390
pulse is a first one which is a sync by

660
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,400
the am modulation that we're seeing so

661
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:03,670
this is the white pass it is one two

662
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:06,250
three and this is the fourth one so we

663
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:08,470
have four as a synchronism and then a

664
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:12,610
smaller ones that are narrower ones one

665
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:15,669
two three four five six well not not all

666
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:21,330
of them but at least ten because I've

667
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:21,330
counted those before let's check it out

668
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:38,170
so we have one two three four white

669
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:40,390
pulses and we have ten the done narrow

670
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:45,400
so one two three four five six nine ten

671
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:48,240
and that meant for white pulses and ten

672
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:52,300
narrow commands that's the acceleration

673
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,620
one and let's use the break in command

674
00:48:52,300 --> 00:49:00,400
so that you see it's different so I

675
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:02,170
press and stop so these are all narrowed

676
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,490
there's no white pulse

677
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:09,040
so we have ten narrow pulses are as many

678
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:12,220
as we want to send we can have one and a

679
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:16,529
loop or we want this one to be nerve

680
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:19,470
because breaking has no synchronism

681
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:24,280
frequency so let's check the left side

682
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:27,850
here some of there are some of them left

683
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,620
side we have 1 2 3 4 30 that are white

684
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:33,460
and I don't know how many that are

685
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:35,859
narrow so here you see how we send the

686
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:38,620
signal through an analog system and this

687
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:41,470
is digital so this can be have white

688
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:44,589
pulse and we as a reference taking one

689
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:46,600
and for a narrow pulse a zero just came

690
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:50,140
up with a code and here it would be 1 1

691
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:52,990
1 1 1 0 0 0 and that's the number of

692
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:55,750
narrow pulses that we have so what about

693
00:49:52,990 --> 00:50:00,279
the right side and that way we see the

694
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:04,050
hole all of the commands there so right

695
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,050
side would be 1 2 3 4

696
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:13,550
and number of narrow pulses that's the

697
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:15,529
left one we try to focus on accelerate

698
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:18,890
because maybe on the right side it will

699
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:21,260
crack so accelerating so let's go

700
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,720
through it again and let's repeat the

701
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:29,990
test again

702
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:34,339
stop 1 2 3 4 that's for accelerating and

703
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:45,410
then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 narrow pulses

704
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:49,540
so 4 & 3 so we closed it so what do we

705
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:53,390
do next now that we've seen how it is

706
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:55,730
sending so save it on the drive save it

707
00:50:53,390 --> 00:51:02,720
on a WAP system and I'll explain how we

708
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:06,190
can edit it so let's name it let's save

709
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,189
it here for example

710
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:26,080
a little accelerate were speed up so

711
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:32,839
come here and let's press play and so I

712
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:36,279
saved it here stop close and we should

713
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:40,430
have a fine that is accelerate that wop

714
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:45,550
so we open it it with an editor so see

715
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:49,098
we are using here a music editor

716
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:51,440
audacity have you heard of it which is a

717
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:58,130
music editor where we can mix and cut

718
00:51:51,440 --> 00:52:00,410
and process the music files why do we

719
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:06,950
use this that is actually a music

720
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:09,970
process in up well it works as a song so

721
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:14,689
what we have recording is just samples

722
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:18,529
songs as you know is was a WAP is 24 to

723
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:20,599
100 so we've saved a 2 million so it's

724
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:25,700
just the same same processing as with

725
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:29,869
the music file if we keep an increase in

726
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:34,520
it what do we find it looks like what

727
00:52:29,869 --> 00:52:37,849
we've just seen right 1 2 3 4 of white

728
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:39,770
pulses and 1 2 3 up to 10 the narrow

729
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:44,270
pulses and this is repeated through time

730
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:49,040
so I got the what grown man well doesn't

731
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:52,190
matter so we have wave here waves that

732
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,940
are signed wives waves that are small

733
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:57,290
very small and here we are zooming and

734
00:52:54,940 --> 00:53:01,010
and since they are so close together

735
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:04,040
this is the descriptors of one when it

736
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:06,440
is sent well nothing is sent is a zero

737
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:09,920
if lots and lots and lots of waste

738
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:13,280
another one so it is modulation which is

739
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:16,060
a and modulation and lock modulation in

740
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,060
with

741
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:25,230
and now what that we've saved it we can

742
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:38,250
record the signal we can save the signal

743
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:41,609
and remove this I will not do it from

744
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:43,560
scratch because it would take us a

745
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:46,859
little while and we would be short of

746
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:50,460
time but same as before this is the

747
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:54,480
output from our remote and same as

748
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:57,510
before from the input of our remote all

749
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:02,070
the way to the output which here is same

750
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:09,570
device so we are bridging from the input

751
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:14,220
to the output from our SDR there and so

752
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:16,619
next what we do not do is pluck the

753
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:18,990
output credibly but we process the

754
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:21,630
signal from the minute it goes into the

755
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:25,890
receiver until well so would we've

756
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:29,970
processed here is a oscilloscope so and

757
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:36,200
it goes there reaches there why do we

758
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:36,200
need it well we need to see

759
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:44,320
it's a stable frequency not no nice here

760
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:53,950
let's see alright

761
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:02,720
iced tea

762
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:12,200
but tenemos traffic when Thea esto le

763
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:18,220
fella y cuando el mundo so that is

764
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:18,220
stable I press something's going on

765
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:30,890
alright so what do we have here so we

766
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:36,319
have pulses ones and simmers what we get

767
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:38,810
here is our previous sequence sequence

768
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:43,280
with wit ones and zeros here would we've

769
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:48,650
done is as a reference we've taken time

770
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:50,480
from the transmission of a 1 sorry this

771
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:54,050
was a saber so from the beginning of the

772
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,970
sending and then the time once the

773
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:59,360
sending of the one starts and then it

774
00:55:55,970 --> 00:56:03,589
ends so we are saving the time and we

775
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:05,870
have it here so we have time that it

776
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:11,300
takes to use and a 1 so that we have a

777
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:15,350
frequency or a square bunt this is a

778
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:17,600
square band same time as you take us to

779
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:21,410
have our reference frequency from the

780
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:23,089
radio remote let me expedite it because

781
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:29,029
otherwise we've run out of time so

782
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:32,720
what's next next we knit team do this

783
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:35,440
and we have the time price so we get it

784
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,439
with frequency

785
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:47,950
our code 1 1 1 1 so 4 ones and 10 zeros

786
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:55,310
so that's a goat weekend

787
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:57,830
so we add a victor lids magnifier so

788
00:56:55,310 --> 00:57:01,160
that I can see it this is our effector

789
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:12,500
and so what we do next is so there's a

790
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:19,640
previous frequency so you can see right

791
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:23,870
so what we do here is 3 ones this is the

792
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:26,509
white pulse 10 is 0 we stopped

793
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:29,060
transmitting then 3 more ones another

794
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:31,790
white one and then 0 and then 4 times

795
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:37,160
over so we have 4 pulses that are

796
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:39,980
synchronism sent by the remote in

797
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:48,859
accelerating and then 10 small pulses 0

798
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:54,040
1 0 1 0 1 that's a vector we combine it

799
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:56,900
with a sine signal as a reference that

800
00:57:54,040 --> 00:58:00,080
we've produced which is just a regular

801
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:03,080
sine wave as a reference and then we

802
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:09,350
combine it with a vector and we got it

803
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:13,040
here on screen so this is what's been

804
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:17,720
recorded or saved on the drive and we

805
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:24,759
see that we had our frequency and there

806
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:24,759
we had this Plus this this is the peak

807
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:29,740
where we are working on transmitting

808
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:36,319
this is the count that we produced next

809
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:48,649
and so we press them we click it on

810
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:52,330
transmit and here all right so what's

811
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:55,340
here so this is the signal produced by

812
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:59,029
ourselves without touching the remote

813
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:01,910
this has been produced by ourselves with

814
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:03,770
the vector that we added its ones and

815
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:05,120
zeros and so what do you have there

816
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:07,310
there is no noise right

817
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:11,000
why is there no nice because it's been

818
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:14,930
produced by our SDR and it's not going

819
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:18,470
on air it is just inside our word

820
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:21,529
generator it's not out in the air so we

821
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:28,270
are producing for wide and ten narrow

822
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:31,030
pulses so that goes on air first let's

823
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:35,020
save it on the disc on their Drive and

824
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:35,020
we'll test the signal

825
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:54,269
accelerate one that's what we've

826
00:59:44,910 --> 01:00:03,450
prettiest press cat and Jane on the

827
00:59:54,269 --> 01:00:07,410
drive this is what we heart and then we

828
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:11,399
have the bottom signal so we've got one

829
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:13,170
two three four wide pulses and 10 that

830
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:21,839
are narrow similar to what we had before

831
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:32,339
so if we start cutting I don't know how

832
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:35,089
many seconds so if we cut this somewhere

833
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:35,089
around here

834
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:49,890
and then we cut a chunk out of here then

835
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:52,859
you see that the source signal original

836
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:55,650
signal looks very much alike like what

837
01:00:52,859 --> 01:01:01,259
we've just done we see that times are

838
01:00:55,650 --> 01:01:05,190
much and with it there is no noise as I

839
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:07,890
said everything you can see here with

840
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:10,619
every pulses noise in the air which

841
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:13,259
cannot be avoided what do we have we

842
01:01:10,619 --> 01:01:20,160
produced ourselves so it is clear so

843
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:29,160
what do we do next we have this with our

844
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:32,910
SDR up on the air all right same here

845
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:38,038
but we just get the signal and what we

846
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:48,000
doing is we're sending on air and I

847
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:51,680
think now yes yes it should start this

848
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,680
is the signal in transmission

849
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:02,240
so we see that and if we come closer

850
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:10,530
here

851
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:14,000
sure move and as it's happening why do

852
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:14,000
we need to come that close

853
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:20,700
people might think well slit will reach

854
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:23,220
right but that's right that's because

855
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:28,189
the game is a slow if we add a larger

856
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:39,868
game and we play and we click on play I

857
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:43,349
come closer come closer and the rich

858
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:47,880
should be increased and with game it

859
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:58,730
comes up these depends on the antenna

860
01:02:47,880 --> 01:03:01,160
and everything 120 so I figured now

861
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:04,920
it'll go further

862
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:08,040
it's 27 megahertz there's noise I'm

863
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:11,609
being eyes and the batteries and

864
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:19,170
everything but that was it from 0 we can

865
01:03:11,609 --> 01:03:24,690
peruse I think it's enough it's we're

866
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:27,900
past airplane age but from zero using

867
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:30,960
Gina's radio we've produced a signal

868
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:39,230
here you have it that was zeros and ones

869
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:39,230
that we caught from this remote and so

870
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:48,310
that's what I wanted you to understand

871
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:50,990
it understands the signal and since

872
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:59,089
zeros and ones as a specific command for

873
01:03:50,990 --> 01:04:01,520
these important thing here is okay this

874
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:05,810
is where we were coming from so we got a

875
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:10,240
signal from an any given car and we've

876
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:12,529
transmitted it did and we've opened it

877
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,990
we copy pasted it

878
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:20,660
so we've copied it and reproduced it it

879
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:22,459
is a simple attack play attack and so

880
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:25,790
we've produced our own signal with our

881
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:30,310
own command what for in case we have

882
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:33,200
that sequencing sequence of the vehicle

883
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:36,170
we know how the codes are prettiest and

884
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:39,680
we can have a code generator and so

885
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:43,849
there's no need to come that close to

886
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:49,190
capture the signal from someone no need

887
01:04:43,849 --> 01:04:52,609
to be there we have a signal generator

888
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:55,010
and we stay next to it and it's as

889
01:04:52,609 --> 01:04:57,369
simple as that than what I wanted you to

890
01:04:55,010 --> 01:05:04,730
understand how can this be avoided

891
01:04:57,369 --> 01:05:08,900
that's what this is all about how no way

892
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:11,480
to circumvent it avoid it prevent it no

893
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:14,330
way whatsoever only thing is one we

894
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,609
press the remote and it's not opening we

895
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:18,770
need to move away because someone just

896
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:22,029
copied our signal if it's a shopping

897
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:22,030
center and we'll leave the car there

898
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:27,440
when we come back maybe we don't have

899
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:30,680
our stuff in there it cannot be avoided

900
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:33,980
it cannot be avoided it needs to come

901
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:38,618
from the manufacturer the manufacturer

902
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:38,619
needs to add an extra coding or

903
01:05:40,220 --> 01:05:51,230
a different code but that will not allow

904
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:54,770
for a code to stay valid after some time

905
01:05:51,230 --> 01:06:04,040
this is obviously the manufacturer so

906
01:05:54,770 --> 01:06:09,259
let's skip on so the whole electronic

907
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:11,180
toll system how does it work I guess

908
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:21,200
we've all used the electronic throttle

909
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:23,450
system an electronic call they're all

910
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:27,250
the same I've never seen anyone that is

911
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:30,919
different standardized it's usually our

912
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:34,670
RF I'd eat hot this one is semi active

913
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:38,540
what does it mean I don't know if you

914
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:41,650
know about passive tax but it would be a

915
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:45,950
chip with an antenna no battery

916
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:47,960
whatsoever but the radio frequency

917
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:52,480
itself there is an antenna sending on

918
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:55,220
that radio frequency and there we the

919
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:58,310
electromagnetic waves it sends manages

920
01:06:55,220 --> 01:07:00,680
to activate the chip and the chip in

921
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:03,740
turn with the radio frequency it

922
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:05,720
received can have a single identifier

923
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:10,069
sent to the antenna to the transmitter

924
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:14,779
that's a passive tag what does a same

925
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:17,060
active or semi passive tag do depends on

926
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:22,220
what we want to call it and how we want

927
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:26,420
to use it it doesn't wait so this a

928
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:32,118
battery and it's no need to since the

929
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:34,070
signal coming in is very weak it doesn't

930
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:36,380
need to use the right frequency from the

931
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:39,440
what was being received but itself it's

932
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:43,070
using the received radio frequency from

933
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:46,040
the antenna to say to the battery okay

934
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:51,140
turn on and feed me so that I can send

935
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:51,910
my signal and my I Dean what does this

936
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:54,490
semi and

937
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:58,509
if tagged do it doesn't use their energy

938
01:07:54,490 --> 01:08:01,240
that receives to transmit but rather to

939
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:05,500
activate the battery and then transmit

940
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:10,660
the ID at a longer distance for instance

941
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:14,740
with 2.4 gigahertz we would be able to

942
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:15,609
transmit on a range of 300 meters that's

943
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:19,899
what we need

944
01:08:15,609 --> 01:08:26,469
whereas in the longer tags the shorter

945
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:29,559
tags it would be 11 meters there are

946
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:31,270
different distances depending on the

947
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:34,170
frequency that we're using for

948
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:37,779
transmitting in this case for electronic

949
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:42,069
roto systems they're semi active and

950
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:45,009
they transmit at 2.4 so when we go

951
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:47,489
through the Tollbooth what do we see

952
01:08:45,009 --> 01:08:52,719
there is an antenna an aerial

953
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:55,479
transmitting a signal to our tag in our

954
01:08:52,719 --> 01:09:01,359
car and then our tag system

955
01:08:55,479 --> 01:09:04,799
I am transmit the client ID but that

956
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:12,310
we've been allocated on what the server

957
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:15,130
gets in the roto system is an ID of who

958
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:19,900
is going through the booth so that we

959
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:22,960
can then be charged every month so what

960
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:27,309
needs to happen for the barrier to lift

961
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:31,049
without having to pay for it it's never

962
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:35,830
so peculiar and it's fun I find it fun I

963
01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:39,698
just have fun with it what did I prepare

964
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:43,899
here well it's an antenna an area in a

965
01:09:39,698 --> 01:09:46,540
choir here is the picture and this is a

966
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:51,908
real-life situation where the system is

967
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:56,050
ready and working in the car the

968
01:09:51,908 --> 01:09:59,980
Arielle is simulating like it's the one

969
01:09:56,050 --> 01:10:05,670
in the rotor system as if it were the

970
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:09,940
server so we're driving normally and

971
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:14,739
we're capturing all the IDS of all

972
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:18,330
vehicles that have the rotor system

973
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:21,638
electronic wrote tow system working

974
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:24,699
let's imagine that we capture 30 of them

975
01:10:21,639 --> 01:10:28,510
the idea is that we can take it in turn

976
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:31,888
to use different IDs on different days

977
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:35,590
so that's different people will find

978
01:10:31,889 --> 01:10:38,980
there's an extra charge at the end of

979
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:43,210
the month will they notice well we don't

980
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:45,339
know doing am I encourage you to do this

981
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:48,940
in real life or not

982
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:52,330
and how can this be avoided well how can

983
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:57,089
we stop this capture from happening

984
01:10:52,330 --> 01:11:03,809
happening well by having a paradigm box

985
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:07,900
protecting us in this case yes as I said

986
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:10,630
it's only a Faraday box protecting the

987
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:14,888
system in our car to make sure that

988
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:16,900
nobody is nasty we're no nasty right but

989
01:11:14,889 --> 01:11:23,469
there might be nasty people they're

990
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:26,799
cheeky people who it'll use the motorway

991
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:28,989
for free and we'll be paying for it we

992
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:34,060
don't do that because we're nice so

993
01:11:28,989 --> 01:11:37,919
let's check what a tag system needs to

994
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:40,900
work and as I said this is not a

995
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,040
hypothetical situation this I did this

996
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:46,179
in real life

997
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:49,900
you will see in a minute this is what it

998
01:11:46,179 --> 01:11:56,460
looks like all these numbers different

999
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:56,460
digits and it comes by default

1000
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:10,860
this long list of digits for the tongue

1001
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:13,320
so because the our company works with

1002
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:15,599
software development one of the things

1003
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:19,230
that we've prepared is a programmable

1004
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:23,160
chip so that the code can go in any

1005
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:25,889
position we like so as I said we would

1006
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:28,530
go for a little ride in our car it

1007
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:32,880
captured a number of IDs a few of them

1008
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:38,309
and then change the ID in the right

1009
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:42,120
position so that with a switch we would

1010
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:45,960
just activate our transmitter for the

1011
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:54,630
electronic road to system the antenna

1012
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:57,750
would receive it and we would go through

1013
01:12:54,630 --> 01:13:02,760
as if we were somebody else some other

1014
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:05,610
car when we go through the Tollbooth the

1015
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:08,760
system would be activated and the area

1016
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:12,420
with thing would think that as I said we

1017
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:15,600
are driving some other car that's the

1018
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:18,750
way to use the motorway for free

1019
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:22,830
pretending where somebody else how can

1020
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:26,239
you avoid us well by isolating is with

1021
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:26,239
the Faraday box

1022
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:38,550
cage sorry Faraday cage right I'm

1023
01:13:35,970 --> 01:13:42,300
running out of time so let's keep moving

1024
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:48,750
let's now check how alarm systems work

1025
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:55,470
at home I post an alarm from one of

1026
01:13:48,750 --> 01:14:01,950
these pound lands I wrote Chinese run

1027
01:13:55,470 --> 01:14:08,070
shop they tend to be not great but still

1028
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:12,809
I bought a well-known brand I got the

1029
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:17,820
code from the alarm system when you arm

1030
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:24,120
and disarm the alarm this is a very

1031
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:26,700
basic capture technique on FM because

1032
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:29,400
it's a very simple system it has to be

1033
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:31,950
something cheap what we saw for instance

1034
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,929
in the remote-controlled toy toy car

1035
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:36,330
that worth work that was more of a

1036
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:38,970
simple system in the case of their

1037
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:41,519
residential alarm is a little bit more

1038
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:44,790
complex so let's see how we can crack

1039
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:48,090
that code and we can cheat again well

1040
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:53,840
it's very similar technique here we have

1041
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:57,110
the client in this case the homeowner

1042
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:03,060
who would activate the alarm when

1043
01:14:57,110 --> 01:15:05,610
leaving home the alarm is activated you

1044
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:08,760
are meet you leave your home and you

1045
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:11,250
think it's safe what would we do then

1046
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:14,780
well we would be close by

1047
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:19,980
we would then capture the code the

1048
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:23,009
homeowner had to transmit to arm the

1049
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:27,699
alarm and then it would also be nearby

1050
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:32,050
when the homeowner comes back home to

1051
01:15:27,699 --> 01:15:34,389
capture the code to disarm or deactivate

1052
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:38,710
the alarm again this was a well-known

1053
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:43,989
brand for this alarm system and in fact

1054
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:47,640
we found that the code is identical both

1055
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:54,190
for arming and disarming can imagine how

1056
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:59,350
terribly unsafe that's that is normally

1057
01:15:54,190 --> 01:16:02,650
a la car alarms are safer I found than

1058
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:06,790
alarms for homes is a little bit

1059
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:09,280
pathetic right pressing the using the

1060
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:13,060
same code both for activating and

1061
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:16,500
deactivating Villa that's a message for

1062
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:20,320
my presentation never use a wireless

1063
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:26,440
alarms is much better if they they're

1064
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:28,599
wired because with the wireless system

1065
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:33,099
is you have quite a high probability

1066
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:35,710
than the code will be less secure so as

1067
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:40,630
I said you would use the code and you

1068
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:44,350
would be able to access gain access as

1069
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:44,980
if you were the home owner let's see how

1070
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:48,640
it works

1071
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:54,780
we're not going to be working with GNU

1072
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:54,780
radio in this case the radio GNU

1073
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:02,129
here it is

1074
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:10,960
I'll be using the same program we saw

1075
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:13,500
earlier to capture the frequency let's

1076
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,500
see what it is

1077
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:32,710
all right

1078
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:38,900
see I tell you what or not here it is

1079
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:49,310
button a and button B what are we doing

1080
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:56,299
now wanna see how it works I press

1081
01:17:49,310 --> 01:18:00,520
button a for arming this is button a for

1082
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:08,780
arming now I'm going to press button B

1083
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:11,630
whoops here we have it a button a button

1084
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:14,630
B for arming and disarming I just wanted

1085
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:18,080
you to see that so let's take a what

1086
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:24,440
frequency is the right one for

1087
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:28,540
transmission for this control if it were

1088
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:33,589
a European frequency it would be 443

1089
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:36,680
megahertz well as an approximation

1090
01:18:33,590 --> 01:18:39,830
let's press button a there we have it

1091
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:46,580
let's double check what the exact

1092
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:50,559
frequency is in this case is 434 997 I'm

1093
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:50,559
going to copy paste it

1094
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:56,830
4 3 2 9 9 7

1095
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:15,430
there it is and now we're going to copy

1096
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:18,070
you

1097
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:26,650
first thing we need

1098
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:29,950
to do is recording on the hunt harddrive

1099
01:19:26,650 --> 01:19:34,290
our button a how do we need to do that

1100
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:39,460
in this case we need to be more accurate

1101
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:42,010
more precise we're transmitting on a

1102
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:46,270
different modulation so we're going to

1103
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:49,450
be using the open source osmocon project

1104
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:55,060
and which tends to work much better than

1105
01:19:49,450 --> 01:20:00,730
the one I showed you earlier here it is

1106
01:19:55,060 --> 01:20:07,580
minus F for a the frequency minus G for

1107
01:20:00,730 --> 01:20:09,450
the gain and minus R for recording good

1108
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:11,640
[Music]

1109
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:15,570
here it is

1110
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:21,270
we need to do the sampler for a million

1111
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:21,269
what do we need to enter now minus F

1112
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:35,040
four three two point nine nine seven

1113
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:35,040
right the frequency I got just now

1114
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:43,820
right

1115
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:22,180
good this is similar to what we had

1116
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:30,650
earlier on I need to press the button

1117
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:42,050
and here a 4-3-3 right so Wow I now need

1118
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:49,610
to name the file but eh I press record

1119
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:52,970
and I stop it it's exactly the same as

1120
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:57,500
we saw earlier on in this case this

1121
01:21:52,970 --> 01:22:01,250
command has worked how we stood near the

1122
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:06,890
home we pressed the record button we

1123
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:09,470
waited for the homeowner to live and we

1124
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:15,340
have captured that a as a button

1125
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:15,340
I let's see what the file contains

1126
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:38,970
why did I save that I think it was here

1127
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:44,989
I hope you can see that can you see this

1128
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:44,989
here the print is a little bit small

1129
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:59,220
well I can see here some little marks

1130
01:22:53,730 --> 01:23:01,230
like stains some of them are wider some

1131
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:04,020
of them are narrower what does that mean

1132
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:09,750
well as we said earlier the narrower

1133
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:14,700
ones equate to zero and the larger or

1134
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:19,790
wider ones are a sine waves that would

1135
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:24,870
equate to one so that would equate to

1136
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:30,650
nodes and ones making up a code so that

1137
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:30,650
the control can transmit that code right

1138
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:40,500
if we can do this manually but this is

1139
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:44,910
very helpful it's very visual

1140
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:49,890
you see North node one one not one not

1141
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:54,570
one and so on that is generating

1142
01:23:49,890 --> 01:23:56,100
sequence is what I need two copies by

1143
01:23:54,570 --> 01:24:01,019
the way is it not

1144
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:04,870
not one well and so on I've copied it a

1145
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:08,420
I don't want to waste time

1146
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:12,970
so we generate that code with notes and

1147
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:16,880
ones or what do we need to do next just

1148
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:20,060
as I showed you earlier we need to then

1149
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:22,370
analyze the width of a post

1150
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:25,460
although in this case I'm using this

1151
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:29,930
more visual system I find it a lot more

1152
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:34,730
convenient to be honest you see there it

1153
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:37,610
is I'm going to explain you how it works

1154
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:40,250
but in fact the idea is a little bit

1155
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:45,559
this is one I prepared earlier we've got

1156
01:24:40,250 --> 01:24:48,170
there 25 pulses you know and look how

1157
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:50,900
it's synchronized perfectly well it this

1158
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:52,280
is not like the remote control that I

1159
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:57,530
showed you that I bought from the

1160
01:24:52,280 --> 01:25:01,160
Chinese shop and where it was it varied

1161
01:24:57,530 --> 01:25:03,590
quite a bit in this case is much better

1162
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:06,320
secretly synchronized you see this the

1163
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:10,280
post starts then it comes down another

1164
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:13,549
one starts it comes down and from this

1165
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:18,860
line through the next that would equate

1166
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:21,650
to a full sine wave so from this line to

1167
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:25,700
that one that means the sine wave goes

1168
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:29,030
through zero because a sine wave always

1169
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:31,910
starts at zero it goes up to 1 2 3

1170
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:35,420
whatever then it comes down back to 0

1171
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:40,070
before it goes back up again in this

1172
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:43,100
case we see the posts very tiny pause

1173
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:45,559
within the sine wave so it's not even a

1174
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:50,150
whole sine wave this is more or less

1175
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:52,250
half of 1 this is a narrow post coming

1176
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:55,339
down to 0 then going back up again

1177
01:25:52,250 --> 01:26:00,500
another narrow post and look at that

1178
01:25:55,340 --> 01:26:04,970
third one it almost fills up completely

1179
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:08,600
the sine wave so we have separated those

1180
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:10,880
narrower pulses from the wider poses the

1181
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:15,300
narrower poses tend to be round about

1182
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:19,560
half of a longer post

1183
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:23,670
which is very helpful because the server

1184
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:26,690
for the alarm can tell whether it's a

1185
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:30,030
North order one month and so can we

1186
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:31,530
so you can read the information because

1187
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:36,570
that's what we're doing right we are

1188
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:40,469
just transmitting notes and ones in this

1189
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:45,330
case not digitally but through an analog

1190
01:26:40,470 --> 01:26:52,770
Channel it's a frequency algorithm that

1191
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:55,140
range so I don't want to copy it because

1192
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:59,640
in fact we can do this manually you see

1193
01:26:55,140 --> 01:27:02,790
note note one note one right so I could

1194
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:06,120
do that manually type it in first

1195
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:08,810
I'm not going to do this this is a very

1196
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,809
clever too

1197
01:27:28,959 --> 01:27:34,719
here it is so I said this is very clever

1198
01:27:38,380 --> 01:27:46,999
well I'm saying it's clever I have to

1199
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:51,138
wait and see if it works I'm just going

1200
01:27:46,999 --> 01:27:56,360
to enlarge I want okay can you see that

1201
01:27:51,139 --> 01:27:56,689
letter size from the back well there we

1202
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:00,709
have it

1203
01:27:56,689 --> 01:28:07,880
we have that number what does that say -

1204
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:11,599
- - - all of those numbers minus nine

1205
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:16,010
minus nine minus six minus six

1206
01:28:11,599 --> 01:28:19,760
what does that mean that's width - six -

1207
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:22,179
well sorry a white one a white post and

1208
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:26,869
narrow post that's what it's saying

1209
01:28:22,179 --> 01:28:37,190
meaning this is a nose or this is a one

1210
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:40,150
that's the message well

1211
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:40,150
the one I prepared earlier

1212
01:28:55,610 --> 01:29:02,900
so I said this is one I prepared earlier

1213
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:06,470
so this is where I have the value for a

1214
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:10,580
so I don't need to copy paste it so

1215
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:13,130
again as we did earlier we've got it

1216
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:25,640
ready now what what what can we do with

1217
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:33,640
it we make sure the sequence has no gaps

1218
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:39,830
in between the digits we copy that

1219
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:42,530
sequence then of digits and then I get

1220
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:46,100
my Arduino how much to this cost

1221
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:48,769
well about 10 euros that's all I have a

1222
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:50,840
radio frequency transmitter I bought

1223
01:29:48,770 --> 01:29:54,170
this one at a Chinese shop by the way

1224
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:57,800
how much does this cost what about five

1225
01:29:54,170 --> 01:30:02,830
heroes that's all so it's a very simple

1226
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:05,480
system right a very simple device

1227
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:09,019
another one which is a little bit more

1228
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:13,490
complex but still it's analog right so

1229
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:17,840
just that very small investment plus a

1230
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:21,019
little wire simulating an alarm system

1231
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,790
that costs hundreds of euros to gain

1232
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:25,760
access to a home that might cost

1233
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:30,980
hundreds of thousands of euros as he who

1234
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:35,530
works we connect the Arduino let's cross

1235
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:35,530
our fingers so it works first time round

1236
01:31:00,269 --> 01:31:07,139
the reason I wanted to show you this is

1237
01:31:03,449 --> 01:31:11,030
that we have those two different ways to

1238
01:31:07,139 --> 01:31:14,909
record a signal the first exercise

1239
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:19,739
recorded the doorbell signal saving it

1240
01:31:14,909 --> 01:31:22,049
recording it and then reproducing it

1241
01:31:19,739 --> 01:31:28,049
playing it again without having the

1242
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:31,019
command then the radio control remote

1243
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:33,960
control to a car we started there from

1244
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:36,690
scratch generated the signal from

1245
01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:37,739
scratch with pulses with pulses with

1246
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:41,730
modulation

1247
01:31:37,739 --> 01:31:48,659
whereas this time we used a more visual

1248
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:51,869
tool like so getting then the code for

1249
01:31:48,659 --> 01:31:56,518
the alarm because we were standing

1250
01:31:51,869 --> 01:32:03,360
nearby with an modulated so we could see

1251
01:31:56,519 --> 01:32:05,429
the code or codes to arm and disarm the

1252
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:09,719
alarm and then we broadcasted we

1253
01:32:05,429 --> 01:32:15,929
transmitted a thanks to the Arduino so

1254
01:32:09,719 --> 01:32:23,639
this is the code I copied we now paste

1255
01:32:15,929 --> 01:32:28,110
it for our magic Arduino to work let's

1256
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:30,659
hope when I press it works so we program

1257
01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:34,860
the art you know with the disarm code I

1258
01:32:30,659 --> 01:32:37,079
don't know if you can hear it I can hang

1259
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:41,820
on there is an error mode because there

1260
01:32:37,079 --> 01:32:44,299
is another one here I didn't get the

1261
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,299
right one

1262
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:59,730
the port was wrong

1263
01:32:51,440 --> 01:33:01,710
this is the right one so for those of

1264
01:32:59,730 --> 01:33:05,849
you at the back of the room you won't

1265
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:11,840
hear it but it's transmitting I can hear

1266
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:11,840
it let me show you the demo now

1267
01:33:40,599 --> 01:33:47,940
I now can

1268
01:33:41,969 --> 01:33:52,590
the Arduino now there is not working I

1269
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:56,210
wonder what happened there it's getting

1270
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:58,889
to where it needs to go I can hear it

1271
01:33:56,210 --> 01:34:05,420
alright because he's fifteen thousand

1272
01:33:58,889 --> 01:34:05,420
two hundred this is life what I wrecked

1273
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:24,329
he was B was it zero here nine six

1274
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:28,360
double oh well I'm just setting it

1275
01:34:24,329 --> 01:34:29,590
because earlier on it was used using the

1276
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:36,190
wrong ports

1277
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:40,690
I still use I might be old-fashioned but

1278
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:43,719
I still use a serial port for my

1279
01:34:40,690 --> 01:34:47,169
communications so you will see it's USB

1280
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:49,659
here but in fact the serial port is

1281
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:54,090
still quite common because it can cope

1282
01:34:49,659 --> 01:34:57,848
with much larger speeds call me

1283
01:34:54,090 --> 01:35:02,019
nostalgia's but I communicate with our

1284
01:34:57,849 --> 01:35:06,460
my art unit Arduino at nine six Duvall

1285
01:35:02,019 --> 01:35:11,010
oh that's what I'm like let's hope it

1286
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:11,010
works now oh there it doesn't

1287
01:35:19,739 --> 01:35:25,808
again apologies because only people who

1288
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:29,440
are right at the front of the room will

1289
01:35:25,809 --> 01:35:33,639
be able to hear how this is working the

1290
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:37,888
relays are being activated here is not

1291
01:35:33,639 --> 01:35:43,829
connecting up properly no idea why

1292
01:35:37,889 --> 01:35:50,770
apologies but the helic HELOCs

1293
01:35:43,829 --> 01:35:53,409
wave I actually made this system by

1294
01:35:50,770 --> 01:35:56,409
myself with a screwdriver you just

1295
01:35:53,409 --> 01:35:59,980
measure the links you need to measure

1296
01:35:56,409 --> 01:36:02,530
the wavelength at 400 megahertz I can't

1297
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:05,919
remember how many centimeters that

1298
01:36:02,530 --> 01:36:09,730
equates to and for the width is the same

1299
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:15,460
idea so just for 10 euros plus my

1300
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:20,530
Arduino I could gain access to a home

1301
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:23,050
with an alarm you just have to take my

1302
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:26,500
word for it how can you how could you

1303
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:30,219
avoid somebody doing something like this

1304
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:34,150
well having an alarm which is not

1305
01:36:30,219 --> 01:36:37,659
wireless which is also not a very

1306
01:36:34,150 --> 01:36:40,839
well-known brand so that people can't

1307
01:36:37,659 --> 01:36:44,230
copy the code and what kind of alarm

1308
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:49,179
would that be well definitely wired not

1309
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:52,598
wireless system your sensors should be

1310
01:36:49,179 --> 01:36:56,110
wired not a wireless because I forgot to

1311
01:36:52,599 --> 01:36:58,510
tell you a story earlier on I had to buy

1312
01:36:56,110 --> 01:37:03,670
an alarm for me to learn how to do this

1313
01:36:58,510 --> 01:37:06,849
and the most popular brand in our

1314
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:09,070
country that's the one I bought and I

1315
01:37:06,849 --> 01:37:12,159
found that the communication between the

1316
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:14,980
sensors and the server their main

1317
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:19,329
station in that communication is not

1318
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:21,848
safe they say it is but is not so apart

1319
01:37:19,329 --> 01:37:23,858
from copying the remote control from the

1320
01:37:21,849 --> 01:37:29,619
alarm you can also actually

1321
01:37:23,859 --> 01:37:32,530
cheat the system for instance if I if it

1322
01:37:29,619 --> 01:37:36,188
didn't work with a remote control if it

1323
01:37:32,530 --> 01:37:41,259
worked with a keypad well even then we

1324
01:37:36,189 --> 01:37:43,929
could gain access by telling the alarm

1325
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:47,800
system one particular sensor is not

1326
01:37:43,929 --> 01:37:50,229
detecting anything we would be standing

1327
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:54,550
next to it and we will be able to cheat

1328
01:37:50,229 --> 01:37:57,789
the whole system at the company's

1329
01:37:54,550 --> 01:38:00,869
headquarters for detection not to work

1330
01:37:57,789 --> 01:38:05,409
so it's quite scary right how terribly

1331
01:38:00,869 --> 01:38:07,409
insecure this all is no security

1332
01:38:05,409 --> 01:38:11,308
whatsoever

1333
01:38:07,409 --> 01:38:18,119
so let me move on to the next exercise

1334
01:38:11,309 --> 01:38:18,119
remember this is a key to a hotel room a

1335
01:38:18,989 --> 01:38:21,989
keycard

1336
01:38:22,019 --> 01:38:29,379
right this is going to be a simulation

1337
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:31,899
and I'm not encouraged encouraging you

1338
01:38:29,379 --> 01:38:33,879
to do anything like this but I'm just

1339
01:38:31,899 --> 01:38:39,300
going to show you how it could be done

1340
01:38:33,879 --> 01:38:39,300
how does a keycard work at a hotel in

1341
01:38:46,449 --> 01:38:54,879
the card has a chip have you seen many

1342
01:38:52,510 --> 01:39:10,780
hotels with her with a key like this I

1343
01:38:54,880 --> 01:39:16,030
haven't not many hotels have a key card

1344
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:19,300
like this it's quite an unusual one but

1345
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:24,099
in fact it's quite a safe system if they

1346
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:28,090
use it right the standard in this case

1347
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:31,810
the iso standard is seven eight one six

1348
01:39:28,090 --> 01:39:40,900
with a protocol that uses an apron

1349
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:48,190
memory how does this work well it has a

1350
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:52,120
memory bank protected by a password so

1351
01:39:48,190 --> 01:39:55,719
we can read the memory bank but we still

1352
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:57,580
need a password and why is this key card

1353
01:39:55,719 --> 01:40:00,340
different or peculiar

1354
01:39:57,580 --> 01:40:04,360
well because we can read it we can see

1355
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:08,050
the code we can see the ID for that key

1356
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:11,290
card plus any other information that the

1357
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:16,060
manufacturer or the hotel resection has

1358
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:18,040
added with that six digit password what

1359
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:21,940
happens is that when you enter your

1360
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:27,130
password wrong three times the key card

1361
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:29,919
self destroys imagine that what does

1362
01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:34,360
that mean that there are fuses physical

1363
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:37,300
fuses so that when you enter the

1364
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:40,449
password wrong three times there is a

1365
01:40:37,300 --> 01:40:43,330
hard voting a high voltage like a search

1366
01:40:40,449 --> 01:40:47,259
right five six votes something like that

1367
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:50,070
and the cord is physically invalid

1368
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:54,490
because it burns basically

1369
01:40:50,070 --> 01:40:57,009
so it's a very safe card right can you

1370
01:40:54,490 --> 01:41:02,320
imagine how hard it is for you to guess

1371
01:40:57,010 --> 01:41:08,830
a six digit and PIN number I mean you

1372
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:11,679
you might get lucky one day I've broken

1373
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:14,380
lots of cards like that I ended up

1374
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:16,570
ruining them many many times because it

1375
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:30,130
is very hard to guessing a code like

1376
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:32,049
that what did we come up with so this is

1377
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:37,390
the card the inside this is an apron

1378
01:41:32,050 --> 01:41:40,720
card as I said it has a memory bank that

1379
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:43,510
is 20 1024 bytes is a small one some

1380
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:46,240
others are 2048 and others are 4096

1381
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:51,730
depending on the one we want to buy but

1382
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:53,980
in order to store a hotel room number we

1383
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:57,400
don't need much information so you see

1384
01:41:53,980 --> 01:42:00,820
the first 6 bytes in our bank memory

1385
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:03,460
bank much a single ID usually that the

1386
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:05,799
manufacturer those six bytes cannot be

1387
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:10,450
modified we can not save anything on top

1388
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:14,170
of them on paper every manufacturer

1389
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:16,120
would have six digits are located same

1390
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:19,600
as with computers there are some numbers

1391
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:21,849
from X number T Z number and there's a

1392
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:24,970
serial production of cards and can only

1393
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:28,150
use those numbers allocated to them by

1394
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:31,360
the authority in charge of regulating it

1395
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:35,349
all and we are allowed to you right from

1396
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:37,089
the sixth byte onwards so o 600 was the

1397
01:42:35,350 --> 01:42:40,870
beginning and from all seven own words

1398
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:42,630
we can write as much as we want but in

1399
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:46,559
all that you write we need a PIN number

1400
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:49,390
we can read even the ID no problem there

1401
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:51,490
that we've allocated to the card and we

1402
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:53,440
can just write if we know what the pin

1403
01:42:51,490 --> 01:42:55,660
number is there's no other writing

1404
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:58,320
method only by knowing the pin will be

1405
01:42:55,660 --> 01:42:58,320
able to write

1406
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:05,330
this is a real card from the hotel no

1407
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:07,340
names given here bad well any given

1408
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:10,370
Hotel what was recorded in years

1409
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:13,220
there was an ID naturally as with any

1410
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:17,230
other card and three bytes only three

1411
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:19,610
bytes here if you know how to translate

1412
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:21,980
hexadecimal to decimal system is quite

1413
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:24,110
simple and straightforward here it was

1414
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:29,299
zero zero zero six eight five which

1415
01:43:24,110 --> 01:43:31,670
would be room 101 in the XML system it's

1416
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:33,860
not too hard right not even them ever

1417
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:37,130
control or anything of the kind no

1418
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:40,580
encryption nothing so directly it was

1419
01:43:37,130 --> 01:43:43,520
101 why is that well they know why the

1420
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:45,500
ones who did is they know that they

1421
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:47,840
trusted the security and the protection

1422
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:50,210
given by the pin number that is a

1423
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:52,850
succeeded and also the self-destruction

1424
01:43:50,210 --> 01:43:53,420
of the god technology is good yes it's

1425
01:43:52,850 --> 01:43:56,420
old

1426
01:43:53,420 --> 01:43:58,940
yeah very old this is from the 90s and

1427
01:43:56,420 --> 01:44:02,720
I'll explain the story on how it all

1428
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:04,820
started and how I actually started

1429
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:07,520
looking into this protocol and this card

1430
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:09,139
I'll explain the anecdote but please let

1431
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:12,680
me finish

1432
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:15,560
what's inside room 102 you just the same

1433
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:17,600
hexadecimal to decimal there's a simple

1434
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:25,300
conversion but not too difficult right

1435
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:25,300
and in this hotel the master game

1436
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:31,510
someone if someone would guess what the

1437
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:31,509
code was

1438
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:39,660
zero zero zero zero the empty cart is

1439
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:44,460
filled with ones so here for the master

1440
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:48,300
key zero zero zero zero and as I say

1441
01:44:44,460 --> 01:44:51,810
this is real live I got the cart don't

1442
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:55,140
ask me how but I managed to read it and

1443
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:57,630
I guessed the code for it not very

1444
01:44:55,140 --> 01:44:59,490
difficult it is just common sense right

1445
01:44:57,630 --> 01:45:02,610
do you see one two three cards you just

1446
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:08,670
try it out and easily you find a

1447
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:10,730
combination to open any given door all

1448
01:45:08,670 --> 01:45:10,730
right

1449
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:17,040
so how does the sturb begin because I

1450
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:21,030
before I move on I'd like to share the

1451
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:25,410
story with you as I said I grow old and

1452
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:27,150
in the 90s I was already thinking it

1453
01:45:25,410 --> 01:45:29,700
through and there's this friend who

1454
01:45:27,150 --> 01:45:31,860
comes and says you know there is a video

1455
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:34,050
clef or a video store do you remember

1456
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:36,420
what they were like you know what a

1457
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:37,950
video store is but I see young people in

1458
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:40,980
the audience but in the past we had a

1459
01:45:37,950 --> 01:45:43,679
video shop or a video store they would

1460
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:46,230
have a sticker with the barcodes and

1461
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:48,090
they would read your barcode that was

1462
01:45:46,230 --> 01:45:50,429
your ID as a client and they would

1463
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:53,820
charge you whatever and you can you

1464
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:56,070
could rent anything and then some 20

1465
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:58,969
years ago 20 years ago it hung flies

1466
01:45:56,070 --> 01:46:01,530
right but they got him up to date and

1467
01:45:58,970 --> 01:46:03,930
started using a cart like this with a

1468
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:04,710
chip in it same as I said before with

1469
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:07,410
the hotel

1470
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:09,630
and a friend comes and says there is

1471
01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:13,980
this chip card at a video store

1472
01:46:09,630 --> 01:46:16,440
well now it's different I went how can

1473
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:20,940
you not okay you was neat to look into

1474
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:23,339
it and sure I just screw the the regard

1475
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:27,120
and just three atoms and it was ruined

1476
01:46:23,340 --> 01:46:29,940
it is worse than real no more read in

1477
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:33,780
three attempts I looked into the

1478
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:36,839
protocol and the standard and it is true

1479
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:39,450
Phillips Phillips the one that came up

1480
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:41,370
with this kind of card included

1481
01:46:39,450 --> 01:46:43,760
self-destruction options so asked for

1482
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:45,769
another card got another one

1483
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:48,700
said okay this one I need to give it

1484
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:51,440
it's been to and I don't through time so

1485
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:53,599
not a third time so what did they come

1486
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:59,620
up with him back in the day to guess the

1487
01:46:53,600 --> 01:47:03,560
code it took him some time lots of time

1488
01:46:59,620 --> 01:47:06,410
loads of hours working hours but what

1489
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:10,660
did I invent well what did I come up

1490
01:47:06,410 --> 01:47:15,670
with I decided to have a card this one

1491
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:18,230
okay you cannot well what did I do a

1492
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:20,000
physical card we don't have any it was

1493
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:23,450
it's not a plastic card but a physical

1494
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:27,770
card instead just one like that

1495
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:28,580
I studied electronics for five years in

1496
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:30,500
case you didn't know

1497
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:33,920
apart from computer science I am

1498
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:36,050
familiar with electronics and it built a

1499
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:40,460
physical card for myself just like this

1500
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:44,710
one the same size and the length was a

1501
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:50,990
bit larger and I would get wires or

1502
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:51,350
threads something like this what would I

1503
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:55,309
do

1504
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:57,500
I would pluck the connector the pin the

1505
01:47:55,310 --> 01:48:00,470
pins inside the machine I would get them

1506
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:04,100
out to my cars that I had built myself

1507
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:07,310
in order to weld some wires and see what

1508
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:09,140
the machine was ridden physical card

1509
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:12,670
that you had to enter or swipe through

1510
01:48:09,140 --> 01:48:17,210
the reader and back then when laptops

1511
01:48:12,670 --> 01:48:19,640
were nothing like today's I wired to the

1512
01:48:17,210 --> 01:48:24,110
car and won lots of inventions in

1513
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:27,170
between but like that I got to you get

1514
01:48:24,110 --> 01:48:30,019
the physical pins of the machine inside

1515
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:34,340
of a board that I produced myself and I

1516
01:48:30,020 --> 01:48:35,420
entered my original card into my machine

1517
01:48:34,340 --> 01:48:37,940
so what did I do

1518
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:41,060
I put it right in between so this has

1519
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:43,280
been done at a hotel because this was my

1520
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:45,230
cyber country true but it all started

1521
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:49,880
further ago when there were what they're

1522
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:50,990
still we're video shops or stores so I

1523
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:53,420
have that card

1524
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:56,059
I wore it my card all the way to the

1525
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:56,630
real card this one here I place my safe

1526
01:48:56,060 --> 01:49:00,440
in

1527
01:48:56,630 --> 01:49:02,719
between to see what was being sent what

1528
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:06,949
did I manage to see well the pin on the

1529
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:09,320
card and I had several cards but the

1530
01:49:06,949 --> 01:49:12,739
same thing over and over so funny isn't

1531
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:14,750
it and I saw what was transmitted all

1532
01:49:12,739 --> 01:49:19,610
through the card see the machines all

1533
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:22,460
the same pins always the same well so

1534
01:49:19,610 --> 01:49:24,710
does using breeders like this one this

1535
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:26,659
is a bit more modern this is a parallel

1536
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:28,300
port but this is very modern this we

1537
01:49:26,659 --> 01:49:32,089
didn't have before

1538
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:36,110
then the serial port if you remember

1539
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:38,300
back when we had the via digital and

1540
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:40,730
other readers that are used for this

1541
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:46,040
kind of readers but this is from before

1542
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:48,019
that canal channel class I will I was

1543
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:50,840
familiar with the cards but it comes

1544
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:55,550
from earlier than that so what I did was

1545
01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:57,980
get the pin code out which was unique

1546
01:49:55,550 --> 01:50:00,159
and all cards have a pin code so I could

1547
01:49:57,980 --> 01:50:03,110
modify my card

1548
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:06,290
we just had see what the card hot not

1549
01:50:03,110 --> 01:50:12,110
not this one this is the hotels car but

1550
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:14,449
it had an ID the video store was using

1551
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:19,790
as a client ID and had the balance in

1552
01:50:14,449 --> 01:50:21,440
the card in it so five euro I don't know

1553
01:50:19,790 --> 01:50:23,389
how many pesetas it would have been back

1554
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:25,190
there about five year now and you would

1555
01:50:23,389 --> 01:50:29,030
be have it a year and you would describe

1556
01:50:25,190 --> 01:50:32,269
it and you would get a five euros worth

1557
01:50:29,030 --> 01:50:34,420
and I cut the pin and I managed to

1558
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:34,420
modify

1559
01:50:35,610 --> 01:50:42,630
I didn't bring the owner to Irene as a

1560
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,550
statement I'd lost at last I got to see

1561
01:50:42,630 --> 01:50:47,580
some films for free

1562
01:50:44,550 --> 01:50:49,440
this is good right how we can how can we

1563
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:53,190
prevent it and we need to know how to

1564
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:59,780
use the card we cannot live information

1565
01:50:53,190 --> 01:51:02,910
and encrypt it never ever ever card

1566
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:06,480
quite safe because it's self-destructive

1567
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:10,220
and old technology but very safe and

1568
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:10,219
Pooley used as the usual

1569
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:16,470
that's what a hacker does this is not

1570
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:18,360
inventing is not just we've found that

1571
01:51:16,470 --> 01:51:21,480
technology is not properly used that is

1572
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:23,519
not being done right they encrypt

1573
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:27,450
information and instead of five years

1574
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:29,850
you say oh five you kind of have five

1575
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:32,940
year encrypted with a parrot or a public

1576
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:35,370
key so that I didn't know I cannot know

1577
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:38,429
that this sequence is says five year

1578
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:42,570
that's a conclusion here you need to use

1579
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:46,890
the technology right I think we have

1580
01:51:42,570 --> 01:51:50,130
time for one breeding I haven't said it

1581
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:52,710
before this card came in later

1582
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:56,700
I removed everywhere in everything as I

1583
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:58,890
said same as with the car and it no it

1584
01:51:56,700 --> 01:52:01,280
had to be done at night so that was not

1585
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:01,280
fun

1586
01:52:05,559 --> 01:52:13,629
and the the prison wasn't you buy so had

1587
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:13,629
to be careful

1588
01:52:14,260 --> 01:52:25,760
so these God maybe the older people in

1589
01:52:23,389 --> 01:52:29,229
the room know about it but know what a

1590
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:33,469
big is an EPROM is big is a programmable

1591
01:52:29,229 --> 01:52:37,999
microchip but is inside the card so you

1592
01:52:33,469 --> 01:52:40,339
can have this is not so trivial it isn't

1593
01:52:37,999 --> 01:52:44,329
an assembler it is a basic assembler

1594
01:52:40,339 --> 01:52:47,269
it's the NYX assembler 8-bit very basic

1595
01:52:44,329 --> 01:52:53,058
but you can program yourself code inside

1596
01:52:47,269 --> 01:52:56,959
the card see we have time oh no really

1597
01:52:53,059 --> 01:53:00,649
not so you can program your card and on

1598
01:52:56,959 --> 01:53:03,050
the assembler you can build things so

1599
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:05,719
what did I do this is my card

1600
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:09,320
the card I have and you put it into the

1601
01:53:05,719 --> 01:53:14,389
reader and it slave the byte sequence

1602
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:16,429
sent by the the sender so you have the

1603
01:53:14,389 --> 01:53:19,280
original card the other card and it

1604
01:53:16,429 --> 01:53:24,079
saves the pin and we cannot try it

1605
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:26,869
because we don't have time and you keep

1606
01:53:24,079 --> 01:53:30,398
it with a card like this you didn't know

1607
01:53:26,869 --> 01:53:30,398
warriors or anything of the kind

1608
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:38,270
so a hotel what else can we do apart

1609
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:41,320
from sleeping and come breaking into

1610
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:46,430
other people's rooms with this kind of

1611
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:49,820
cards one can have fun with industrial

1612
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:53,540
control of our hotel our hotel is quite

1613
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:58,280
complication there's boilers fancy

1614
01:53:53,540 --> 01:54:04,070
boilers actually also temperature

1615
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:09,759
control or window opening and blind

1616
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:09,759
control so what can we do with it we

1617
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:20,510
have the bus protocol which is high

1618
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:23,150
level but underneath there is an rs-485

1619
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:25,370
communication control we were talking

1620
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:27,679
about a different kind of our s and

1621
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:30,670
before now thesis have been what's

1622
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:33,350
interesting about 485 well it sense

1623
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:37,640
London in the range is long-distance

1624
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:39,860
here it sends through channel a that's

1625
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:43,540
positive information and channel B same

1626
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:47,360
information but negative so it sends I

1627
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:50,660
have one positive on channel 8 and

1628
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:55,309
negative 1 and channel B what is it good

1629
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:59,630
for probably just so that you understand

1630
01:54:55,310 --> 01:55:02,900
the idea is to send information for long

1631
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:05,660
distance is widely used in areas with

1632
01:55:02,900 --> 01:55:07,429
high noise wherever we have lots of

1633
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:10,010
interference and we want to make sure

1634
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:14,950
that information does not reach this

1635
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:20,980
nation altered and here we have a short

1636
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:25,790
demo of a module it to black to a fan

1637
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:29,030
this one with two buttons and it's not

1638
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:31,570
pass that who these people they language

1639
01:55:29,030 --> 01:55:35,809
they used to communicate and in between

1640
01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:37,759
everything we've done before is for

1641
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:41,390
sniffing is not right frequency sniffing

1642
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:43,920
here but MA bus protocol that we are

1643
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:46,830
sniffing is a serial transmission

1644
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:49,470
how does Mark buzz work from one module

1645
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:52,050
to the next communication follows one

1646
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:58,220
flow is not about two ways but it's only

1647
01:55:52,050 --> 01:56:03,150
two ways so it has no Rx and TX only TX

1648
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:04,860
it only sends one way reading our our X

1649
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:07,620
is transmitted when it comes from a

1650
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:10,049
previous module so information travels

1651
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:13,410
just one way not two ways but one way we

1652
01:56:10,050 --> 01:56:15,990
stay in between or in the middle and the

1653
01:56:13,410 --> 01:56:19,830
bad guy here gets all the information

1654
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:26,550
sent by the button here the circum and

1655
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:30,059
so this is it so recording reading this

1656
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:33,900
is the map fast normal protocol this is

1657
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:39,060
a button so activate the fan so I stay

1658
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:41,429
in between us if you remember about the

1659
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:44,280
power practice from a year some years

1660
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:47,430
back here it is not buzz but back there

1661
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:49,170
it was canvas Oh Baskin just the same

1662
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:52,530
you are in the middle you listen

1663
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:54,180
everything coming from button a you grab

1664
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:56,099
the command you're interested in you

1665
01:56:54,180 --> 01:57:00,450
change it and send it through bus again

1666
01:56:56,100 --> 01:57:03,030
and you easily cheat where any module so

1667
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:05,250
at the hotel you know that he what can

1668
01:57:03,030 --> 01:57:06,960
we use it for it see how much from my

1669
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:10,230
hotel is if you change where

1670
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:12,570
temperatures in the rooms was a lighting

1671
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:16,139
turning oven on the lights people go

1672
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:18,780
crazy and you have lots of fun lots of

1673
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:20,940
fun for an evening for example and you

1674
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:24,840
can change anything you want you can

1675
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:27,200
trigger wrong lumps and hidden systems

1676
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:30,000
and sensors that are not working

1677
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:32,670
actually I was thinking of turning and a

1678
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,680
ventilator and a fan on you can't eat

1679
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:37,130
any device saying that they are

1680
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:40,980
overheating even though it's not true

1681
01:57:37,130 --> 01:57:45,510
those are all things then the travel

1682
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:50,490
path and I have finished and how does it

1683
01:57:45,510 --> 01:57:54,890
work a Travel Pass work same as before

1684
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:54,889
this kind of cards that I have here

1685
01:57:55,190 --> 01:58:02,540
these are cards without a chip or

1686
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:05,780
anything they are just RFID and if they

1687
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:09,620
have an identifier same as here is a

1688
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:12,160
single one but the difference is what's

1689
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:12,160
the difference

1690
01:58:13,330 --> 01:58:18,710
these ones are protected or secured with

1691
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:23,809
a self instruction but not these so it's

1692
01:58:18,710 --> 01:58:27,040
unlimited attempts as many comments as

1693
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:31,220
you want probably you cannot say that

1694
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:34,250
the memory database aims here this is 20

1695
01:58:31,220 --> 01:58:36,140
sorry 1024 this one as well which can

1696
01:58:34,250 --> 01:58:41,630
choose whatever you want but the memory

1697
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:43,430
protection is not limited to any attempt

1698
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:47,810
you can send as many attempts as you

1699
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:52,310
want so what did we need to do with this

1700
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:55,400
card in order to modify it well we need

1701
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:57,830
to be patient mainly why do we need to

1702
01:58:55,400 --> 01:59:00,650
be patient because algorithm in it is

1703
01:58:57,830 --> 01:59:03,140
huge it would take us ten thousand years

1704
01:59:00,650 --> 01:59:06,049
to struct the mind the code out of the

1705
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:09,490
card there are people who are very smart

1706
01:59:06,050 --> 01:59:12,080
in this world or with plenty of time or

1707
01:59:09,490 --> 01:59:15,860
well with lots of interest and they've

1708
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:19,460
managed to x-ray the card some seen the

1709
01:59:15,860 --> 01:59:21,200
chip inside it's unprotected cuda

1710
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:23,890
manufacturers would protect the chip

1711
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:31,720
with kind of a booty so that you cannot

1712
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:34,190
x-ray it and it's interesting and it is

1713
01:59:31,720 --> 01:59:34,820
unprotected and you could see it from

1714
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:41,990
the inside

1715
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:43,670
and they found a way to not to send so

1716
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:47,090
many attempts and that way they would

1717
01:59:43,670 --> 01:59:49,430
get the number so that is the key the

1718
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:54,080
record and key the right and key out of

1719
01:59:49,430 --> 01:59:57,890
8 so down from 10,000 years that it's 2

1720
01:59:54,080 --> 02:00:00,559
to the power of 14 10 to 1 hour and

1721
01:59:57,890 --> 02:00:03,250
within an hour we can change any given

1722
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:03,250
card and

1723
02:00:03,260 --> 02:00:10,400
move around for free riding a buzzer the

1724
02:00:07,099 --> 02:00:12,500
metro or anything it's a pity because

1725
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:15,619
again we would need an extra hour here

1726
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:19,429
and we cannot show it vending machine

1727
02:00:15,619 --> 02:00:23,210
same as before same cord but instead of

1728
02:00:19,429 --> 02:00:29,179
NFC is RF ID while the vending machines

1729
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:34,280
are not nicely damn manufactured it's

1730
02:00:29,179 --> 02:00:37,460
easy to see okay I'm not a fan of

1731
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:41,449
vending machines how does it work same

1732
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:44,239
as before but what do we do we use

1733
02:00:41,449 --> 02:00:48,289
everything I don't know what it is but

1734
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:51,138
same readiness before and through brute

1735
02:00:48,289 --> 02:00:53,329
force what we brute force it and it

1736
02:00:51,139 --> 02:00:56,889
doesn't take that long and sorry we're

1737
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:59,690
out of time but that's what I had to

1738
02:00:56,889 --> 02:01:00,250
share thank you very much I hope you

1739
02:00:59,690 --> 02:01:06,909
enjoyed it

1740
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:10,599
[Applause]

1741
02:01:06,909 --> 02:01:10,598
other questions

1742
02:01:14,269 --> 02:01:21,110
no question so everything is clear then

1743
02:01:18,119 --> 02:01:21,110
thank you very much for your attendance

1744
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:27,780
how can you get after the card if you

1745
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:31,440
wanna come and touch it's all really can

1746
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:34,650
come and touch that's way bring it if

1747
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:38,780
something doesn't work is just a matter

1748
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:38,780
of speaking live

1749
02:01:40,590 --> 02:01:48,319
