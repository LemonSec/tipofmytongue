00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:50,110
presentation

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,400
very quickly will tell you about what a

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,310
private detective is

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,750
how a private detective get trained how

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,280
our profession is regulated then the

33
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,580
relationship between private detectives

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,640
and cybersecurity also what we currently

35
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:11,240
need highly proof highly qualified

36
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,540
people in cybersecurity and our private

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,990
detective companies and then cases

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,790
associated with cybersecurity

39
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,460
characteristics are a cyber security

40
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:25,190
professional should have to work in a

41
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:27,650
private detective firm often these

42
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,459
characteristics are shared by many of

43
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:34,190
the needs that our requirements when it

44
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:36,490
comes to becoming a consultant for

45
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:40,400
instance one of them being availability

46
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:44,060
however I would well I also would like

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,880
to talk about the advantages and

48
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,730
disadvantages of it then also what can a

49
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,630
cyber security professional expect if he

50
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:57,709
were to work in a private detective firm

51
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:03,470
and then how can I contact private

52
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:07,130
detective firms to offer my candidacy to

53
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:11,739
work there and well I have to say that

54
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:17,060
there is no there are lots of well and

55
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:19,610
regulated jobs in professions so

56
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,739
therefore I just wanted to offer this

57
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,560
information for you to know whether if

58
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:29,050
you are sending your CV whether you're

59
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:32,989
sending that CV to a legal company and

60
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:35,540
license company so let us start off with

61
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,730
well what is probably detector and

62
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,530
regulation of our profession first of

63
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,410
all the private detectives are the only

64
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,530
professionals that are legally enable

65
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:48,560
enabled or qualified to obtain and

66
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:52,010
provide information and evidence about

67
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:57,079
behaviors of private matters

68
00:03:52,010 --> 00:04:01,129
so we to investigate on those people and

69
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:04,879
any one working in our team has to have

70
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:08,470
legal license so how many active

71
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,679
detectives are there in Spain 1,400

72
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,750
1,400

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:19,608
there are like some 4,500 licenses but

74
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:22,789
only 1400 active detectives 70% of them

75
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:27,710
are men and we have an increasing number

76
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:31,789
of women now starting staying at 30%

77
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:35,979
so prime investigation services they are

78
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:39,909
about having out necessary

79
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:45,190
investigations to obtain and provide

80
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:48,889
information and evidence associated with

81
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:54,699
behaviors of private matters associated

82
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:58,460
to the following aspects often we have

83
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:00,860
cases where a person calls us wants to

84
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,349
find her about the vasa passages that

85
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,530
his partner hapana is sending out to

86
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:10,310
someone else or for instance finding out

87
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:14,599
about type of lifestyle of a neighbor or

88
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:20,360
wants us to take photographs of a person

89
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:23,150
he is maybe related or not so therefore

90
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,270
we cannot carry out those type of

91
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,039
activities actually we cannot carry

92
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,979
those type of investigations actually we

93
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,380
were to do it that would be unlawful so

94
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,539
what are these aspects that I mentioned

95
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:40,940
before those associated with well

96
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:43,969
financed labor and economics so

97
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,080
therefore we have we can investigate

98
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:50,780
people in those fields fields as

99
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,770
economic financial labour American child

100
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,888
or trade field with the exception of the

101
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,789
activities that are carried out in

102
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:01,970
homicides or

103
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:06,620
reserved places okay and then we also

104
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:10,570
obtain information and guarantee the

105
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:17,090
normal development of trade fairs hotels

106
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:21,050
exhibitions events conventions so places

107
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:25,789
were a significant number of people and

108
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:28,700
where the there may be people like has

109
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,740
not wearing a uniform and ensuring the

110
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,349
normal development of performance of the

111
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,320
activities also we also carry out

112
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:39,620
investigations to obtain information and

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:44,240
evidence relatives to crimes that can

114
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:47,810
only be prosecutors after being on the

115
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:52,910
request of subjects that are legitimate

116
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:56,540
in criminal process that is to say we

117
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:59,030
need to have a person accusing it we

118
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,040
just that cannot be an ex-official

119
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,320
prosecution on the part of the

120
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,590
government and then whatever important

121
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,510
qualifications of detective well it

122
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,780
seems that anyone could become a

123
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:15,140
detective or claim to be a detective now

124
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:19,760
private detectives in Spain one of the

125
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:23,060
best trained detectives in Europe and

126
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:26,960
actually our degree is an undergraduate

127
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:30,800
degree and there are also training

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,430
courses given out at university for 180

129
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,590
credits that enable or qualified the

130
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,110
person to work as a private detective

131
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,349
what are the universities offering these

132
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,760
degree volunteer competences Salamanca

133
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,340
Alicante oedema

134
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:52,930
Pablo la Viva as well as other online

135
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:52,929
universities where you can study

136
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:05,419
and Patrice today

137
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:10,449
well we study Constitution under

138
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:12,349
criminal law Criminal Procedure and Oh

139
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:15,639
Civil Procedure

140
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:19,580
no civil law like if we Birkin too

141
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:22,189
similar to in law school we also study

142
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:25,580
social psychological and criminal

143
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:34,120
science the ontology and then in the

144
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:40,399
last year we do practices we practices

145
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:43,389
in firms in detective firms so that is

146
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:47,440
students when they graduate have some

147
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:51,139
practical training experience

148
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,449
requirements to be qualified and

149
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:55,820
licensed as a private detective very

150
00:08:53,449 --> 00:09:01,180
quickly so first of all you need to be

151
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:03,819
Spanish national or European then

152
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,380
psychological aptitude and physical

153
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:13,849
capacity what does that mean it means

154
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:17,779
that we need to have the same well

155
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:21,949
obtain the same aptitude certificates

156
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:28,010
that police people or security guards

157
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:33,769
need to have to carry arms also not

158
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:36,010
having any police records so these

159
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:39,339
requirements are not necessary to go to

160
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:42,889
university to follow the undergraduate

161
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:45,639
studies or the Diploma that I mentioned

162
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:51,220
before but these requirements are needed

163
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:54,260
to be qualified to be licensed as

164
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,630
private detective

165
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,300
therefore after fulfilling with these

166
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:03,620
requirements I will be I will be getting

167
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:08,209
my lessons anti card now our profession

168
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:15,170
is regulated but no 5 - 2014 from the

169
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:18,140
4th of April so this is a regulation for

170
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:20,870
private security we are waiting for a

171
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,130
new regulation - for better regulation

172
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,480
of our profession it will be pastors and

173
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:34,360
prohibition what are the things that we

174
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:37,970
cannot do with hunters investigates and

175
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,010
people of from service security world

176
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,770
who will work with us will not be

177
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,130
allowed to carry out the following

178
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:48,710
investigations either that is to say the

179
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,720
crimes that are being investigated by

180
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,880
the government if during our

181
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,910
investigations we become aware of a

182
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,150
crime it's mandatory for us to report it

183
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,800
to the police then we deliver all the

184
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:05,120
information and all the evidence that we

185
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,740
have gathered we give it to the police

186
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:13,780
and that's where our work stop finishes

187
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:17,660
and we cannot investigate intimacy of

188
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:22,640
people as they are staying in the

189
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:24,850
private homes or in reserved places and

190
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,870
we cannot use this type of information

191
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:32,800
or technical elements or materials that

192
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:36,830
encodes against the right of owner

193
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,998
intimacy of the actual person and of his

194
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:43,089
family

195
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:45,999
or also that have an impact or violate

196
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:50,319
the secrecy of communication and data

197
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:55,389
protection we will we are not allowed to

198
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:58,199
use means vehicles or badges that may be

199
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:01,269
similar to those that are worn by the

200
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:04,420
law enforcement agencies we are not

201
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:07,629
wearing any badges or any sirens in our

202
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:11,889
vehicles we try to pass the notice as

203
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:13,749
much as possible have produced a graph

204
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:21,670
to show you the evolution about the

205
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:24,970
different types of investigations so

206
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,199
this is a timeline from 1990 up until

207
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,619
2018

208
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:31,809
so this is a very generic graph so

209
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:34,619
investigations of our labor issues

210
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:34,618
insurance

211
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,910
unfaithfulness or or IT techniques so

212
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:48,549
well if you think that the only thing

213
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,589
that we do are investigations of our

214
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:56,649
people who are cheating on each others

215
00:12:50,589 --> 00:13:02,350
we don't do that we most of our activity

216
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:07,230
is devoted primarily to issues labor

217
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:11,290
issues and well nowadays let us say

218
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:16,629
recently only 10% of the investigations

219
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:19,420
carried housing some firms for personal

220
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:22,529
matters with regard to people cheating

221
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,149
on it and then but with regard to

222
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:28,240
investigations technical investigations

223
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:32,450
IT investigations or any investigation

224
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,150
which is somehow technical

225
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:38,390
here we're seeing a significant change

226
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:42,860
Park in 1990 there were less than 5%

227
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:50,060
whereas now that has been skyrocketed up

228
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:56,680
until nearly 50% I can tell you that our

229
00:13:50,060 --> 00:14:02,150
profession so here we'll have people of

230
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:06,199
all ages a wider range of Ages so now we

231
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:08,180
are having new entrants in our companies

232
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,720
they're very much updated on new

233
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:15,920
technologies but I'd like to say that

234
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:20,120
other firms would require experts in

235
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:23,120
cybersecurity pentesters system

236
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:27,230
administrators do you name it we will be

237
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,440
very soon needing cyber security experts

238
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,800
number firms nearly 50% of the

239
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,870
investigations that we are asked to do

240
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,790
associated one way or another with IC

241
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,650
issues and surely you will not be

242
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,010
surprised when you hear the hundred

243
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,750
percent of the investigations in hundred

244
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,600
percent of our investigations we carry

245
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:50,960
out sometimes of IT investigations and

246
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,940
even if you say mean by IT investigation

247
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,820
finding out the name of the person

248
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,250
working in the company when as long as

249
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:01,940
we get that information from Google

250
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,820
through any browser social media so this

251
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:09,410
is basic and basic thing nowadays and

252
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:15,550
what to be investigating the on the

253
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:19,100
Internet well we investigated browsers

254
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:25,880
being Google social media Facebook

255
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:31,460
Twitter Linkedin we use a script Python

256
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:33,710
we abuse a PS we overuse IPAs this is

257
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,940
for us to get as close as possible to

258
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,870
the personal company that we will be

259
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,690
investigating

260
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:45,960
what fool well because we want to find

261
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:48,050
out about that person who is his family

262
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,820
who are his friends

263
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:56,939
what are his corporate responsibilities

264
00:15:50,820 --> 00:16:01,200
why he meets with these people sometimes

265
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:02,670
and not other times so you will see

266
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,800
later on

267
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:07,560
well the usefulness of all - what else

268
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:13,319
do we check - we investigate later time

269
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:15,479
what do we do what we like what do we

270
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:21,750
like to travel this kind of thing and

271
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:28,140
also where do we work why do we work

272
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:30,360
there and not somewhere else my brother

273
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:33,480
for my job that we had the pharma

274
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,550
company we worked for so all that

275
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,520
information is available on the Internet

276
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:39,959
and we collected there what do we

277
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,870
analyze well we analyze information

278
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:47,730
provided in the browser information on

279
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:52,260
social media personal details address ID

280
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:59,210
card number photographs with the person

281
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:59,210
in them what place education training

282
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:07,800
even if you've given a ticket a speeding

283
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,879
ticket that information is available on

284
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:15,560
the Internet as well as family

285
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,560
relationships personal relationships

286
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:25,579
things that person like hobbies also

287
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,389
events we are planning to attend in some

288
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,580
of our reports we have provided

289
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,920
photographs that we collected found on

290
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:36,679
social media where the person was

291
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:40,070
carrying out an activity that was

292
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:43,100
counterproductive I don't know whether

293
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:49,610
it is dancing or was writing or you name

294
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:52,790
it and then also clients also request us

295
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:57,219
to investigate other matters and that is

296
00:17:52,790 --> 00:18:00,379
the reason why I'm here today

297
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,960
so plans asked us to investigate all

298
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,350
fair competition issues that are very

299
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,610
much associated with the IT forensics

300
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:13,510
assistance management's also leaking of

301
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:16,490
confidential information detection of

302
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,550
intrusions later on which has a very

303
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:22,940
curious case of our intrusion detection

304
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:25,220
also industrial espionage companies have

305
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,880
very concerned about that this is not

306
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:33,770
only about corporate data going public

307
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:37,250
on the internet and then issues related

308
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:39,820
to data protection or data protection

309
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,570
regulation but it is about having

310
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:48,790
competitors spying on you stealing

311
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:52,429
industrial information and kind of well

312
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:55,760
overtaking you and then in terms of

313
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:58,940
insurance fraud many of the fruits that

314
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,770
are investigated in Spain are easily

315
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:06,640
solved through number of posts on

316
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:08,420
Facebook for Instagram this is a person

317
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,000
bragging about

318
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:14,990
I don't know having driven a racing car

319
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,450
door car or saying that he was I don't

320
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,890
know

321
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:22,750
Hill there and also information prior to

322
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:25,440
contracts imagine that a company wants

323
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:29,710
to engage in business with a Chinese

324
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:35,940
company while company may have some

325
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:40,660
information still to know what is behind

326
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:43,240
that actual company the company may look

327
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,990
very good especially beginning after the

328
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:51,100
first order but then perhaps the Spanish

329
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:54,940
company will never will get paid were

330
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:57,159
and then as I say before engaging into

331
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:01,450
business contracts we also covered

332
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:04,360
investigation about the company and as I

333
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:07,650
say many of the other cases that we

334
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,990
worked in associated with cyber security

335
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:18,250
whether it is IT service security

336
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:20,350
forensic analysis system testing etc why

337
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:23,590
do we need cyber security experts

338
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:31,959
working with us because of the not high

339
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:35,620
near an IT expert forensic as I may need

340
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,700
and as I say an expert I may have that

341
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:42,129
know-how

342
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:46,630
however sometimes I also want the party

343
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:52,240
to produce that report for me and then

344
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:55,750
one of the latest uses that had the

345
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:59,380
we needed to have the expert witness I

346
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:04,570
hire as an expert witness that I trust

347
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:10,050
and he produces and expert witness

348
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:16,060
reports and then I also produce reports

349
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:19,120
so that these IT experts also gives his

350
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,730
deposition and what do I need an ethical

351
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,750
hacker because sometimes I really need

352
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:27,190
to know the status in the system since I

353
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,850
have been compromised

354
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,880
I also need an intelligence analysts why

355
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:37,090
is that because we gather so much data

356
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,630
as a result of our investigations and

357
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:43,840
data not only connected and online but

358
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:46,200
also data that is gathered in the street

359
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,970
because we are following people

360
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:54,810
surveillance people then we bring

361
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:59,500
together all the data data that is later

362
00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:04,450
clean that is used to produce a final

363
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:09,850
report well so we also need experts in

364
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:13,870
programming JavaScript PHP Perl these

365
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:19,669
are the paradigmatic programming

366
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:21,379
languages for mixing a ps4

367
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:25,980
[Music]

368
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:31,470
any type of misuses or abuses then

369
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:35,910
system administrators often in cases of

370
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:43,860
in nutrition the company may not be

371
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:46,590
interested in that is known that an

372
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:49,740
investigation is being carried out so

373
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:53,730
therefore we sent someone to go to the

374
00:22:49,740 --> 00:23:00,000
company and to see what is happening in

375
00:22:53,730 --> 00:23:03,060
the company also editor of IT systems we

376
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,990
need an expert to cover out analysis not

377
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:09,629
eating for us and then well many other

378
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:15,930
needs and requirements that we find on

379
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:22,050
as we play as we go on now I'm going to

380
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:27,390
share with use cases that are related to

381
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:31,909
cyber security as a result of solving

382
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:37,490
some of them I was awarded a prize and

383
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:43,560
some of these cases also helped prevent

384
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:51,060
significant harm to citizens that's the

385
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:53,550
reason I've been awarded that prize all

386
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,740
those prizes so this one is very

387
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:58,740
interesting case surely you will be

388
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:03,170
severe variation an insurance company

389
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:05,940
contacted us because one of the insured

390
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:08,760
people said

391
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,430
reported that some jewels had been

392
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:17,220
stolen at his home

393
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:20,310
so no first no well the jewels were

394
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,620
stood in specific place or kept in a

395
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:28,020
specific place and we were asked to

396
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:30,770
investigate the case because insurers

397
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:34,620
were claiming high significant

398
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:37,139
compensation so we just did a pure

399
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:41,550
investigation went over there gathered

400
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:44,040
evidence so with all that evidence we

401
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:47,370
moved on to analysis well analyze the

402
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:51,149
case then well some things were not

403
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:54,120
worthy suspicious we and as we were

404
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:57,330
seeing all - an idea came to mind and I

405
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:01,590
say because these jewels were Jews in

406
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:09,120
general watches and the like had been

407
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:11,760
stolen so we were investigating the case

408
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,919
but at the same time we had to estimate

409
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:19,110
the value of the jewels that had been

410
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:21,840
stolen so therefore we asked the share

411
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:26,459
person to send us photographs where we

412
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:29,370
could see the stolen jewel for instance

413
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:32,100
a watch for us to see the brand to feed

414
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:35,520
and to estimate the value of fish and

415
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:38,250
what we expected the person was to send

416
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,840
us photographs of either no big events a

417
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:48,780
wedding or first communion often that's

418
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:51,000
what you were you jewels but contrary to

419
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:56,100
what we expected but we got for the

420
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:02,610
insured person were just photographs of

421
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:06,059
the jewels and then all place on top of

422
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:09,870
table there were a series of well three

423
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:14,399
or four photographs but actually we just

424
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:17,520
did not expect to have him to have these

425
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,140
type of photographs both on the masseur

426
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,850
okay let us take a look at those

427
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,010
photographs let us analyze the

428
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,110
photographs that he shared

429
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:28,110
person-centered then I said well

430
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:32,428
analysis expect with this analysis

431
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:35,580
well metadata see what's behind which

432
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:38,070
are the data of those photographs we

433
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,350
could all do that anyone could do that

434
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,250
you don't really need to be an expert so

435
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,820
what did we find

436
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:49,700
okay the theft took place in May

437
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:52,139
photographs were made in July and we're

438
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:58,140
at his home

439
00:26:52,140 --> 00:27:00,750
I took the jeweler's I put them on the

440
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:04,020
table I took a photograph s sent that

441
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:06,570
out to the insurance company well I

442
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:11,850
don't have information about the shirt

443
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:15,770
person so you don't really need to be an

444
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:20,370
expert to know that mobile phones well

445
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:23,760
consenting a lot of information attached

446
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:29,129
to a photograph what the case will be

447
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:31,910
second court and as I say I her as an

448
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,799
expert witness for him to carry out a

449
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:37,020
detailed comprehensive analysis of the

450
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,040
photograph I don't know how the case

451
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:47,010
will be eventually solved because it is

452
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:53,610
pending distribution what report so

453
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:56,370
second case stealing of information the

454
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,559
company is asking us to investigate some

455
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,260
anonymous documents that had been

456
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:04,379
received in the company about internal

457
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:10,379
processes in the company so these

458
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:13,080
documents were not expected to leave the

459
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:18,419
company so therefore we expected someone

460
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:21,270
in the company exfiltrating the company

461
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:23,700
and they will say well surely an

462
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:27,740
employee got a USB

463
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:30,929
recorded or saved as documented data and

464
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:35,309
exfiltrated them what happens when we go

465
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:40,880
to the place well we worked with an IT

466
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:46,020
system who worked there and then the IT

467
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:49,110
system expert found that some

468
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,030
photographs have been sent out from PC

469
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:54,510
and actually this photograph from

470
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:57,918
marketing catalog I never thought of

471
00:28:54,510 --> 00:29:00,480
that but that's the particle operator

472
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:04,020
could see that those photographs had a

473
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,570
hashtag of the original photographs that

474
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,429
were sent out to come to client and I

475
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,840
said well there is a mismatch here

476
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:12,690
between these hashes

477
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,949
okay so analysis was made afterwards and

478
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:20,400
then we asked forensic analysts to do

479
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,030
that analysis for us so that is to say

480
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,700
again

481
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,250
cyber security experts and what did we

482
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,450
find

483
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:32,309
well this person was easily found

484
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,960
located we knew the IP address we do

485
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:37,559
everything we just didn't know how he

486
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,570
did it so we use a stenography and then

487
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,389
this person within those marketing

488
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:45,809
leaflets he introduced this information

489
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:47,580
which was crucial for the company and I

490
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,440
thought that that information was going

491
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,389
to be both specific but in one of the

492
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,970
documents the only thing Buffy was

493
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:56,780
sending out web has were new top

494
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:59,429
managers of the company to have an IP

495
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,260
access outside the company you may go

496
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:03,960
and say well not a big difference in

497
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:07,020
change of terms of the file but there

498
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:12,240
was a change in the hash okay so as I

499
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:14,330
said we located or found the mail the IP

500
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,460
address and then

501
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:24,010
the employer confessed that he had

502
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:24,010
expedited information and that was it a

503
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:34,850
more recent case we were contacted by a

504
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:37,309
client and they told me that the

505
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:40,610
daughter has disappeared from home they

506
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:42,559
didn't know where she is my first piece

507
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:46,039
of advice the one any detective

508
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:50,299
litigated was file a claim go to the

509
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:53,840
police see please do a very good job the

510
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:55,460
uniformity the wonderful team the

511
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,519
Spanish Civil Guard has a wonderful team

512
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,769
to tell any crime related to technology

513
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:04,399
they dealt with it immediately but in

514
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:06,950
this type of disappearance minors you

515
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:11,570
have to act very quickly there's a high

516
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:15,980
risk involved anything you do the more

517
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:19,309
people are that I involved the better so

518
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:22,659
it took the case and in collaboration

519
00:31:19,309 --> 00:31:26,840
with police but it's something else they

520
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:29,929
gathered information from devices mobile

521
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,970
devices phone etc but they gave it back

522
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:35,330
give them back to the clients and what

523
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:38,360
did we do on our side we took those

524
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:41,570
devices it was a tablet the girl had at

525
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,649
home the mobile phone that she had left

526
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:47,299
which is amazing surprising for a minor

527
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:53,928
it is surprising him it's a little on a

528
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:56,379
minor and I computer they had at home in

529
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:59,160
the living room for everyone the family

530
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,600
service occurred as good technology

531
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:04,720
detectives what did we do we analyzed

532
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:09,459
those systems and we found two

533
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:18,330
interesting things first of all mobile

534
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:23,650
phones include routes locations where

535
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:25,780
this girl where that this girl was

536
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:29,880
usually visiting and over the past two

537
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:34,420
weeks the places were completely new and

538
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:40,450
we also found a discussion on her

539
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:46,210
Instagram at home some talk with other

540
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:53,970
minor a boy our hypothesis was that this

541
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:53,970
girl had eloped with this boy so

542
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,810
together with the police we worked and

543
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,760
this hypothesis of course the police

544
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:04,120
does not have enough resources to

545
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:08,080
investigate to put two place people in

546
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:12,340
every place that this girl was had been

547
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:16,510
or to follow this miner they have the

548
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:18,850
minimum resources there for any help we

549
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,780
can provide as a matter of fact private

550
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:21,780
detectives

551
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:25,330
we are collaborators of law enforcement

552
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,580
we have those resources and we use them

553
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:32,470
so we consider the possibility of an

554
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:35,590
elopement and we found the girl where

555
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:39,650
are her boyfriends parents place they

556
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:42,740
had told those people that she had

557
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:45,710
her life was a hell as cher was living

558
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,600
in the street and they had taken her in

559
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:53,380
after as if she was living on the

560
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:56,320
streets so this case was solved in

561
00:33:53,380 --> 00:34:00,200
private investigation and in an online

562
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:05,750
investigation I said I can assure you

563
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:10,099
that if it wasn't for the capabilities

564
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:14,030
of external professionals many detective

565
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:19,159
offices would not be able to do this we

566
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:21,950
need to provide cyber security services

567
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,770
to Detective private executive offices a

568
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:26,388
fourth case intrusion I was taking the

569
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:30,649
picture to remember what I was talking

570
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:33,050
about a company the pharma company tells

571
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:37,489
us that there's been an intrusion in the

572
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:39,200
system they don't know what's for that

573
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:41,658
they may have been information leaked

574
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:45,469
they weren't very clear on that

575
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:47,659
they told us but they didn't want to

576
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:50,649
file a claim because they thought it

577
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:54,950
could be someone from within the company

578
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:58,520
what did we do an external collaborator

579
00:34:54,949 --> 00:35:00,379
of ours a system an administrator so

580
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,580
with the link to us but he was an

581
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:08,750
external person he infiltrated the

582
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:13,369
company as an employee infiltrated sound

583
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:16,320
that well he was actually hired and he

584
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:20,730
starts to work there

585
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:23,619
we wanted him to have office hours

586
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:26,320
during the night to be by himself so

587
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:29,050
that he can gather information analyze

588
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,390
information and move around the first

589
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:33,310
thing is said and I remember this wasn't

590
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:38,049
a weekday and to some day the first

591
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:41,110
thing it said is it that it wasn't just

592
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:43,750
an intrusion the person our people

593
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,240
behind that intrusion so far we didn't

594
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:49,570
know who they were they've managed to

595
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:54,640
have persistence of the system this was

596
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:57,580
a very good pen tester has given lecture

597
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,950
here at this year's Cyber Command we

598
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:02,890
were surprised to see that there was

599
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:04,330
persistence and we decided to leave that

600
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:09,690
persistence there and investigate

601
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:09,690
investigate when the accesses plays

602
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:17,680
through she to know what was going on

603
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:19,150
and with person the terminal and how he

604
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:25,930
did it

605
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:28,420
we know who he was we didn't need high

606
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:30,940
involvement no investigation of the

607
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:35,980
streets but the company told us that

608
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:38,820
based on the profile of this person they

609
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:44,920
thought he was not alone there was

610
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:49,660
something weird so we so we subject the

611
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:53,710
employee to civilians and we saw that

612
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:59,649
four months had the ADF creating a

613
00:36:53,710 --> 00:37:04,030
company for with products to be sir was

614
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:06,250
extra to be able to continue extracting

615
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:09,760
who is going to have a very important

616
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:13,060
advantage competitive advantage against

617
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:18,160
other companies in the sector we drafted

618
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:20,440
a report we had expertise is carried out

619
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,990
by others the chain of custody was

620
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,570
perfect to establish what this person

621
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:29,140
had done and this combined with the

622
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:33,250
investigation report the involvement of

623
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:37,620
his partners this report was taken to

624
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:40,090
the police because there's been a crime

625
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,870
disclosure of complication formation etc

626
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:47,860
this is how we did it other cases we

627
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:50,890
obtain evidence in cases of crimes that

628
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,930
can be persecuted at the request of the

629
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:57,549
claimant who do not investigate

630
00:37:52,930 --> 00:38:01,450
ex-officio crimes that can be prosecuted

631
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:04,810
ex officio for example late harassment

632
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:06,939
at work sexual harassment discovery and

633
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,920
disclosure of secrets you need evidence

634
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:12,280
for all of this you need to keep the

635
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,250
chain of custody you see these and

636
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:18,550
lectures giving by professionals for all

637
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:23,080
of these we need professionals and very

638
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:26,080
often the things they come to us to our

639
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:29,819
offices and we need the technological

640
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:34,098
component crimes against honor

641
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:38,430
as usually slandered for example

642
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:42,259
imprudence company crime intellectual

643
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:42,259
and industrial rights

644
00:38:46,759 --> 00:39:00,420
why because we do print investigation if

645
00:38:53,160 --> 00:39:05,249
you find shoes on the floor to be sold

646
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:10,410
and they're similar to other shoes from

647
00:39:05,249 --> 00:39:14,839
a specific brand this has to do all of

648
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,839
this has to do with cybersecurity

649
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:21,660
characteristics that the cyber security

650
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:25,319
professional needs to have in order to

651
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:28,680
work for a private detective office this

652
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:32,279
may sound very basic but I need to go

653
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:35,009
through them analytic and logical

654
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:41,690
thinking attention concentration and

655
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:43,650
memory of course an exercise if I've

656
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,569
entered this room I need to remember

657
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:49,559
that was never sit in there because

658
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:52,229
we're detail communicating skills body

659
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,759
language influence persuasion empathy

660
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:55,709
the work carried out by this

661
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:58,380
professional that was infiltrated in the

662
00:39:55,709 --> 00:40:01,948
company it was very positive

663
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:05,369
due to his empathy he immediately

664
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:07,140
connected with other people and that

665
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:10,920
considering the family Hugh had had to

666
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:13,920
work in off in working hours where there

667
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:17,489
was almost no one around managing stress

668
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,829
and time very often we work under

669
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:22,410
pressure not just ourselves but those

670
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:25,420
people working with us

671
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:28,859
observation skills curiosity it's like

672
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:33,610
any IT person you need to be up-to-date

673
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:38,560
you need to check for a telegram

674
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:40,240
channels been meticulous and synthesis

675
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,490
skills we have a lot of information and

676
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:47,399
we summarize discretion that's basic

677
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:50,589
ethics very important to patients

678
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,840
persevere the ability to persevere if

679
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:56,550
you're patient you'll be rewarded that's

680
00:40:52,840 --> 00:41:01,690
something I repeat all the time

681
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:05,470
sometimes we spent 20 hours looking at a

682
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:09,610
door and perhaps the person comes out at

683
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:12,250
our 19 well it's easier if you say well

684
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,880
you know one has gone out I leave if

685
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:17,680
you're patient you'll be rewarded

686
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,980
constant training and being interested

687
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:26,169
for new information this things changed

688
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,260
the past I could look for a phone in

689
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,750
Facebook now I cannot have today's

690
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:35,020
something else

691
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:37,660
using tricks we need to evolve and for

692
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,610
that you need training and being

693
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,170
interested

694
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:46,090
what can a cyber state a profession

695
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:50,110
expect from his or her job at private

696
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:52,240
detective office bad things timetable

697
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:59,080
Monday to Sunday this is like a

698
00:41:52,240 --> 00:42:01,540
consulting company the problem here for

699
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,460
example the miner she disappeared on

700
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,980
Sunday they need something Sunday

701
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,210
afternoon you have to be there and

702
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,400
professional is working for us they

703
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:13,120
would need to analyze a devices and

704
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:17,260
Sunday afternoon 20.7 availability the

705
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:20,410
same idea I think it summarized here

706
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:24,730
because is it it's easy to see we don't

707
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:27,129
know when we will need the expertise

708
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,980
from this external professional it's

709
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:35,890
complicated making plans is complicated

710
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:40,720
I'm a plan my holidays on December next

711
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:43,180
week but you don't know if there will be

712
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,209
something coming up on Monday well

713
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:50,049
that's the life of detectives and people

714
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:53,500
working for detectives maximum demand a

715
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:57,760
mistake costs time and there are times

716
00:42:53,500 --> 00:43:00,100
it's sometimes paramount for us time is

717
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,420
against us and we usually have one

718
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:08,230
opportunity very often

719
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:10,000
detectives only have one opportunity a

720
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:12,339
single opportunity to take a picture or

721
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,200
to record a video perhaps that person is

722
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:17,160
not going to come back through that door

723
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:21,450
so you have no other opportunities that

724
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:25,450
involves tension but it's interesting to

725
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:31,240
naturally international travels we move

726
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:34,210
a lot I've put in an under cons in pros

727
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,038
and cons - cons it could be a pro so

728
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:38,410
depends on the person some people like

729
00:43:36,039 --> 00:43:42,010
moving around all this don't like today

730
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:43,779
I came from throg whathe here I'm

731
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:46,299
delighted to be here to give this talk

732
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:49,450
but I'm coming from photography pros

733
00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:51,720
I'll be working what you like I think

734
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:55,210
it's a really cool profession and

735
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:57,160
working in cybersecurity analyzing

736
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:00,789
systems and pen testing something I

737
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,490
really like working for a private agency

738
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:04,299
well at school I know I'm not going to

739
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,450
be a detective

740
00:44:04,299 --> 00:44:11,259
I can't I'm not licensed but I'm inside

741
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:13,598
I have a diploma have a degree without

742
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:16,779
three years three years I can study it

743
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,819
online I'll do my intership in the last

744
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:22,990
year but I could do it with an agency in

745
00:44:18,819 --> 00:44:26,069
my city it's cool the next professional

746
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,069
private detective

747
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:35,140
for the required to have the two aspects

748
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:39,190
detective and professional there's no

749
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:41,350
routine one day it's always different

750
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:43,360
from other even though it's the same

751
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:47,049
investigation people do different things

752
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:50,470
over time they use some bicycle one day

753
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:53,490
and the motorcycle the next day one day

754
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:56,529
this happened last week it was raining

755
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:58,390
the person had a car and a motorcycle I

756
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:00,250
thought he wasn't going to take the

757
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:03,720
motorcycle but he did people do weird

758
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:06,910
things or it's funny seeing what they do

759
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,009
situations that entail constant

760
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:12,250
challenges that's great everything's new

761
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:15,070
everything's different you have to be

762
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:18,160
ahead of the bad guys our guys are not

763
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:22,880
really bad we're not the police but it's

764
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:25,290
cool it's passionated

765
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,920
national international travellers that

766
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:32,300
was under cons but for some people that

767
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:35,670
may be a pro is it it's a good thing

768
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:39,830
going out saying we have to take the

769
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:45,000

770
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:46,680

771

Siddhartha because there's a

772
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:56,600
technological component because that's

773
00:45:50,010 --> 00:46:00,840
what I do of the past three months I've

774
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:06,660
attended a training course at a company

775

776
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:13,620
because we need to train personal

777
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:16,460
satisfaction the success in an

778
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:21,650
investigation you cannot imagine

779
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,650
people's faces or how thankful they are

780
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:27,150
you cannot compare it with anything it's

781
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:31,050
not like your bosses

782
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:33,520

783
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:38,740

they're going to create the association

831
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:32,809
in Madrid but it's going to take a while

832
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:36,288
so my recommendation would be first of

833
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:39,979
all contacted cotton ducting association

834
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:43,039

835
00:49:39,979 --> 00:49:43,928
professional associations since there's

836
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:49,819
a need

837
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:52,269
you'll receive immediate and and this is

838
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:56,329
the case because we have a lot of people

839
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:58,249
that don't have their own agencies

840
00:49:56,329 --> 00:50:03,949
they're just detective working for

841
00:49:58,249 --> 00:50:06,979
agencies they send their series so if an

842
00:50:03,949 --> 00:50:10,159
agency requires means the detective the

843
00:50:06,979 --> 00:50:13,069
area and the other province they access

844
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,949
the database they contact this person

845
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:19,038
they reach an agreement and that's it in

846
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:21,949
my opinion if you work if you can work

847
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:24,589
exclusively for one that so ok there's

848
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:27,319
some private detective agency that I've

849
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:28,759
created external company has devoted to

850
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:33,339
cybersecurity

851
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:39,009
exclusively cybersecurity but I think

852
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:42,130
that the rights approach which I'm sure

853
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:44,829
it will be drawn the future is that

854
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:51,049
private detective agencies will have

855
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:52,519
in-house stuff not for not to be private

856
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:55,038
detectives because they're not licensed

857
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:57,948
for that but it's collaborated it's

858
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:59,779
legal they're considering it and there

859
00:50:57,949 --> 00:51:03,679
shouldn't be any problem instead of

860
00:50:59,779 --> 00:51:05,149
using external collaborators sometimes

861
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,699
like rubber 8 it cannot work in a

862
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:10,118
different province or it's not that

863
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:14,359
person is not available for specific

864
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:15,850
topic having your own employee allows

865
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:19,340
you to

866
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:22,009
monitor his or her trainee you can train

867
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:24,710
that person as an agency you can send

868
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:31,100
that person to receive a specific

869
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:36,800
training course things that will give

870
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:39,680
the agency very good protection and for

871
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:43,850
the employee but this means an

872
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,279
opportunity work in a cool place cooler

873
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:56,950
at least than what you usually see in

874
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:56,950
the IT in cyber security work well now

875

it before but maybe you didn't see it

881
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:46,690
right now there are two ways to assess a

882
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,689
profession one

883
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:58,160

credits and another university course

885
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:05,910
alls I'm not going to go through

886
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:07,440
everything in order to access the to

887
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,910
become a professional a professional

888
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:14,910
detective you need to go to university

889
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:24,799
for this curses you need to finish high

890
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:30,598
school I I'm not sure about the current

891
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:38,700
requirement but at least you need to

892
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:42,089
access University to be an IT expert

893
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:46,649
witness I understand the Ministry of

894
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:49,700
just didn't it license you as an expert

895
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,700
witness in the case of

896
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:55,030
detectives you have to the same thing

897
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:58,420
just something else in order to be an IT

898
00:53:55,030 --> 00:54:03,089
expert witness you don't need license

899
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:12,000
you just need to preview knowledge on

900
00:54:03,089 --> 00:54:12,000
the on that area in our industry

901
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:17,160
professor situation in which many people

902
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:24,130
say their IT expert and they've just

903
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:27,220
follow the three months cars in a little

904
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:30,010
school they're usually computing

905
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:34,149
engineers arty engineers they have

906
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:36,400
university degree and this knowledge

907
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:39,540
will be required by the judge in order

908
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,369
to submit a report to the court and

909
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:46,329
about the detectives there's a

910
00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:49,270
difference between obtaining finishing

911
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:51,250
your degree but the license is giving

912
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:54,759
them by police force the Ministry of

913
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:58,300
Home Affairs with that degree you go to

914
00:54:54,760 --> 00:55:00,220
the Ministry of Home Affairs you need to

915
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:04,380
fulfill a series of requirements that

916
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:08,770
have already been mentioned being in you

917
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:13,540
citizen no criminal record and with that

918
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:17,859
the degree you get your license then you

919
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:21,730
can be a private detective or a private

920
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:24,250
detective agency because there's a

921
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:27,040
difference between an agency that can

922
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:30,460
hire third parties or a private

923
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:34,029
detective the profit detective works for

924
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:36,430
private detective agencies it's a bit

925
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:39,760
complicated to explain aim at a private

926
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:43,899
detective as such cannot provide

927
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:47,290
services to citizens it can only offer

928
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:50,980
he or she cannot only offer his services

929
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:53,790
through an agency the agency has to

930
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,790
fulfill a series of

931
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:58,210
requirements and responsibilities

932
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:22,310
the chain is custody what does it start

933
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:25,640
for a notary you've said that you

934
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:30,200
protected a system entity of the work so

935
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:32,210
with the weekend or how does it begin

936
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:36,500
the chain of custody in this specific

937
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:42,410
case we obtained chain of custody since

938
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:45,530
we arrived that it was extracted and it

939
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:47,899
was analyzed we left staff there that

940
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:52,130
worked on the extracted material the

941
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:55,100
intrusion had already taken place I know

942
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:59,420
what do you mean we didn't manipulate it

943
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:00,980
because it's broken it's a very good

944
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,470
question

945
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:05,180
we collect when we arrived would put

946
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:07,730
that person there because we need that

947
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:09,859
person to be there and work that's one

948
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:14,410
this person sees that there was

949
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:20,930
persistent but intrusion was recorded

950
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:23,319
that's what we deliver any other

951
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,319
question

952
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:38,850
when I'm asked why care costs are

953
