[Music]

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:19,109
thank you all for being here like to

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,439
thank in thievery for creating us a red

4
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,019
comfortable once again so that we can

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,380
share some days speaking about

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:31,640
cybersecurity let's begin with my talk

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:37,700
you've seen the title it's low cost

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:45,059
stink rates which are also known as IMSI

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:48,719
catchers with I've already been

10
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,289
introduced my name is Pedro Condon I'm

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,800
known as Sauron the eye that ever sees

12
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:59,460
everything with this nickname was

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,339
created by some students of mine because

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,140
I compliment eating I like cybersecurity

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,140
and I've been modeling this for a while

16
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,240
this is our agenda we'll have the short

17
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:17,510
introduction which is the basis paraffin

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:23,149
we'll want things to work but we haven't

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:25,810
understood concepts for example a few

20
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:29,630
days ago received a telegram from a

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:34,729
student that has seen part of a project

22
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:37,880
and he wanted to use his mobile phone

23
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,320
and he thought in five minutes ten

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,720
minutes he was going to be able to do it

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:47,600
he realized when I explained the basis

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:51,259
he realized that we should start from

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:56,300
scratch we have to invest a lot of

28
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:58,729
effort there then we are going to see

29
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:03,410
steam gray some commercial products

30
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:05,450
there are many they're marketed we're

31
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:10,359
going to see a low-cost device a very

32
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:13,630
simple one the problems are faced

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,350
we're going to speak about Gemma's to

34
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:21,970
inhibit signals and how we can do so

35
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:24,790
that this jammers which are low-cost

36
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,410
devices and then an IMSI catcher which

37
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,260
is fully interactive that would do

38
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:33,900
everything automatically without further

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:37,000
ado let's review basic concepts 101 I

40
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:42,010
don't want to get it data here but we

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,020
need to know the upper part what an

42
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,899
international mobile subscriber that

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:51,310
indicator or IMS I capture this is

44
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,709
device what we are going to store

45
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,730
whatever you will want and it's going to

46
00:02:53,709 --> 00:03:02,070
act between the telephone towers and the

47
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:05,070
phones we carry around on our pockets

48
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,070
everywhere

49
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:18,268
this is a description which comes from

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:20,340
Wikipedia it says that it's a fake fake

51
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:26,610
mobile tower for new technologies we

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,769
need to fake the signals but be careful

53
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,140
this is illegal

54
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:34,950
we have no license or authorization

55
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:39,779
whatsoever to do this we can have lots

56
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:44,540
of problems but I'll explain what we're

57
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,540
going to do and then their attacks

58
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:54,439
perhaps 3G 4G 5g once it comes into

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,370
existence but we could downgrade the

60
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:01,069
frequency bands live things as they

61
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,540
worked in the past do you some

62
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:05,659
technology for example I don't think

63
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,599
anyone's still uses it then if the

64
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:13,459
demons will see whether it's used or not

65
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:21,409
and will see the myths and realities we

66
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:25,400
have as I've said we have two times I am

67
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:29,389
as I capture which is passive this just

68
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:35,359
for receiving radio electric spectrum we

69
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:38,000
must old it and it emits series of

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,750
things everywhere such as tifus signal

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,280
you install your device and you listen

72
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:50,449
the messages unfortunately if we analyze

73
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:55,719
the messages whether realize that there

74
00:04:50,449 --> 00:05:00,800
are data which could compromise

75
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,889
ourselves brigade's it's like exposing

76
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,310
the national identity document of her

77
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:11,210
phone and then there are active devices

78
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:14,030
that emit this is fully illegal even if

79
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:18,159
the passive devices we have a situation

80
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,159
of lack of legality

81
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:26,250
absence of legality so to speak for

82
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:29,039
those of us who are radio amateurs we

83
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,410
can listen to series of bands but we

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:36,090
should not disclose the content of the

85
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:40,380
messages but we're not injecting signals

86
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,929
Adama is injecting signal signals which

87
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,270
is also illegal but perhaps we'll go to

88
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:50,010
the cinema and perhaps there are signal

89
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:52,969
inhibitors which of course are working

90
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:56,039
so that mobile phones do not ring

91
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:59,390
they're scanning the frequencies so that

92
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,390
you can watch your film

93
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:10,590
this is the myth we have the classical

94
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:13,620
van in the middle with an antenna and

95
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:17,849
all the people involved in this this

96
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,460
seem like a film no one would be

97
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:24,810
surprised at saying something similarity

98
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:30,780
this we see this we applaud and say

99
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:35,460
great it's nice that there heretofore a

100
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:40,619
better coverage the fare to court or

101
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:43,320
receive messages etc I'm saying this

102
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,050
because we've been told that there are

103
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:51,930
cars did you say as ones pictures have

104
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:56,539
been taken but today you don't need big

105
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,539
devices to do this type of things

106
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:08,399
so you can hide it we're going to speak

107
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:12,929
about sim you'll know about this it's

108
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:17,039
the card provided by the carrier it has

109
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:21,529
a master file there's system files and

110
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:32,549
within this file system we are offered

111
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:37,319
the IMS I this is the ID that identifies

112
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:43,169
this with this card and terminal with

113
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:46,919
regards to the carrier we have hired the

114
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:53,219
IMS I have explains it's a 15 digit

115
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:57,198
number and the telephone carrier in

116
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:57,199
order to avoid duplicates for example

117
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:01,819
but it's exclusive for each

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:15,460
devices store them and send it securely

119
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:18,760
in other words if it could compromise

120
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:23,080
you it is linked to your mobile phone it

121
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:27,670
should be sent securely and of course

122
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:37,770
it's linked to any type of natural GP r

123
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:41,580
s UMTS 3g LTE among many others and when

124
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:44,949
5g comes along will you sitting also

125
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:49,000
conversation there's the mobile country

126
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,960
code three digits and of course whatever

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,700
we trouble

128
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:57,520
we know we have roaming roaming services

129
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,140
in the operator the telephone carriers

130
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,170
from other countries will identify where

131
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,270
we come from within the countries we

132
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:09,130
have the mobile network called since

133
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:12,640
there are different carriers we have

134
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:15,720
three digits in Emir region for example

135
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,400
then we have the mobile subscriber

136
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,870
identification number with nine or ten

137
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,980
digits and the purpose of all this is

138
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:29,740
that all together we have 15 digits

139
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:33,250
there are series of 80 commands when we

140
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:37,240
used models we use them there are a

141
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:42,220
thousand ways if knowing the I M is I we

142
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:45,130
have we can write 80 plus CI mi and then

143
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,840
we know it I've made a reference here to

144
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:51,250
80 commands we had which has lots of

145
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,579
interesting commands another project

146
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,410
which is a

147
00:09:52,579 --> 00:10:00,439
teets CMD which will allow us to send

148
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:03,350
lots of commands to research or to

149
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:05,599
search baseband and once you get into

150
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,389
these you get amazed at the number of

151
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,019
things that you can do as I've said

152
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:16,149
these are the 15 digits and in the case

153
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:23,239
of Spain all of them begin with 2 1 4

154
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:25,600
and then it's providers carrier you may

155
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:27,769
have a t/o

156
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,860
which have a letter that identifies the

157
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:34,579
carrier and then they distribute the

158
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:41,329
rest of the digits for each of their

159
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:46,069
customers then we also have the MA

160
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:50,299
it is number identifying the equipment

161
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:56,179
it's a well some people may think that

162
00:10:50,299 --> 00:11:02,089
he may number he does something else

163
00:10:56,179 --> 00:11:06,110
other than identifying the equipment so

164
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:11,329
when we lose our device we report it and

165
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:14,629
then I main number is checked

166
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:19,969
well connection I just don't want to

167
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:23,470
dwell on it and this is an initial

168
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:28,399
connection that gives the mobile device

169
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:34,189
temporary code known as Tim say so and

170
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:39,490
then TMS I is used to identify the

171
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:44,829
device every time we want to connect to

172
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:48,249
the mobile network and TMSI number is

173
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:53,529
generated as the phone is being green

174
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:58,179
status because the original IMS I cannot

175
00:11:53,529 --> 00:12:02,709
be transmitted and as I say

176
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:05,470
TMS I is just to check the identity of

177
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:10,138
the subscriber and how do I know that

178
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:13,480
you are who you are claiming to be so

179
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:17,170
carriers have kind of number of blocks

180
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:21,029
or gadgets to do that here we will have

181
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:25,569
an age and are from location register

182
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:32,379
and the in our visitor location register

183
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:37,559
and these code through the IMS I obtain

184
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:46,509
detailed information which has been

185
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:50,920
stored in h and r v and r and so that

186
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:55,929
the directors if MC code is not obtained

187
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,540
MC is just instead however sometimes i

188
00:12:55,929 --> 00:13:05,040
can use the information registered in my

189
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:09,899
sim card v and r is responsible for

190
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:14,498
locating the device and would assign a

191
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:18,749
TMSI code accordingly who's got access

192
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:21,850
to das well careers have access to our

193
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:28,209
location for instance when a person is

194
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:31,509
missing when information is asked from

195
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:36,729
the carrier the carrier is asked to give

196
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:41,140
the TM si data to find out about the

197
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:45,220
latest steps kind of

198
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:51,130
well given by or taken by the missing

199
00:13:45,220 --> 00:14:06,810
person the device stores TMS our

200
00:13:51,130 --> 00:14:09,430
information data etc so my my website

201
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:16,569
but you may access it now is under

202
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:20,109
construction you can't go back to it so

203
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:24,610
hopefully in a couple of days I will

204
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:26,320
start this will restore my website so

205
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,280
that you can access this information so

206
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,410
therefore I will not go through it now

207
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:37,750
so we should know that we have software

208
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:41,260
such as a I am s ICD providing us with

209
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:44,380
information about the device location as

210
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:49,210
well as network information and as well

211
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:52,450
as the unique data to the of the antenna

212
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:56,260
we are connected to and it also tells us

213
00:14:52,450 --> 00:15:02,770
about the identifier mobile country code

214
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:07,330
and mobile network code and then what

215
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:10,390
these data well mobile telephone is a

216
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,670
way of the seller carrier also has its

217
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:19,569
data however what I don't like is

218
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:23,829
someone to stand in the middle and to

219
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:26,730
retrieve that information so this is one

220
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,730
of the systems

221
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:36,529
and while this is a more complicated

222
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:48,470
graph over we have of what we are using

223
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:58,550
nowadays no matter the access the way we

224
00:15:48,470 --> 00:16:01,370
access so this has been presented in a

225
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:05,750
conference so there are very many

226
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:09,290
experts in this field and also very much

227
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:11,510
experts in attacks to couriers

228
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,000
I will be talking about EMSA cutters but

229
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:19,760
sometimes cutters are being attacked and

230
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,930
all that is compromised and sometimes we

231
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,560
see that more than once we've been seen

232
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:30,890
that we are in a vulnerable situation

233
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:34,660
and while other than being vulnerable we

234
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:39,339
have a number of of the shelf products

235
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,339
but one of them is known as banana

236
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,029
banana through an or is it

237
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:58,229
or is di it becomes an MC culture then

238
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,920
we have a sprinter that is a system off

239
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:04,319
the shelf that we come by demo Daskal

240
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,230
whether we are private detective or law

241
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,020
enforcement agencies or we are just

242
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:14,640
Wanderers who want to buy these type of

243
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:18,150
devices so this was one of the first out

244
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,030
in the market and then we have another

245
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:25,110
side for instance soggy soggy is a

246
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:28,800
manufacturer we are more afraid of

247
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:32,580
frightened here because his got a number

248
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:37,470
of products that as he says his product

249
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:45,919
I can access even to our data traffic in

250
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:45,920
the network as you can may see there so

251
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:52,230
this product can gain access to some

252
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:57,110
functions

253
00:17:52,230 --> 00:18:02,549
notice they claim to have access to

254
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:07,320
intercepting HTTPS for instance to

255
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:16,590
intersect traffic flow in Facebook

256
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:20,070
Twitter Skype etc in terms of fries we

257
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,350
are talking about high amount of money

258
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:29,210
we are talking about active complete

259
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:33,629
systems with a price of 6 million euros

260
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:36,710
governments are of course interested in

261
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:39,929
having this type of systems and some

262
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:43,049
researchers may also be interested in

263
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:47,720
having this type of systems but we

264
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:51,360
because we are movable ok we do not have

265
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,240
that financial capability we will try to

266
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,899
do that at low costs so if you talk

267
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,950
about as they are for years now and

268
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:04,649
where is the earth

269
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:11,490
well Zr is tested dongle that we buy

270
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:15,120
just watch TV channels so it comes with

271
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:19,380
an antenna by design and antenna such as

272
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:22,080
this one and I guess that all of us

273
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,299
carry one of these antennas with us in

274
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,428
our black sack some of these antennas

275
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:35,490
are more powerful than others but here

276
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:38,669
this dongle is 28 32 year so this is the

277
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:44,700
frequency range the frequency range goes

278
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:47,700
from 24 to 1766 megahertz within the

279
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:51,179
radio electric spectrum this is the

280
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:56,220
frequency that they work in the cost is

281
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:59,850
extremely low this is around 12 euros 15

282
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:01,340
euros because they become really trendy

283
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,439
and reduced for

284
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,659
many more things well the price has

285
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,840
increased significantly but anyway they

286
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,340
are available in any stores and these

287
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,770
are a number of modifications and

288
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:18,980
changes AFRICOM equipment we may use a

289
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:27,100
number of confessors to downconvert some

290
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:37,580
signals or upconverting no signals

291
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:41,209
however well the crystals they have are

292
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:43,610
not high quality by still they are a

293
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,970
good way to start to take the first

294
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:49,389
steps without spending high amount of

295
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,390
money

296
00:20:52,910 --> 00:21:01,760
and then we have orders 42 project from

297
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:04,270
MC culture I said that project and I

298
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:10,310
said why not it's really cool actually

299
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:18,860
citing Twitter so right away you can

300
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:23,179
catch all the MCS and the GSM and and

301
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:26,479
then this is but you need it says in the

302
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:29,300
site do you need a PC and say you need

303
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,540
like one USB and I said well I have it

304
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,540
all and this is the setup and I said

305
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,760
well if I have 15 minutes okay we'll

306
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,580
just play around with here and I will do

307
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:45,040
it and I start to monitor things notice

308
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:45,040
it took like no time to do it

309
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:54,960
and now we get to the actual

310
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:57,600
installation well we thought it would be

311
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,649
worth 15 minutes we had to do that we

312
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,488
had to do that we had to do that install

313
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:11,679
installing all that and last 10 during

314
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:14,759
the actual projects to be ready to go

315
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,759
[Music]

316
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:25,180
and just what you have seen the G and

317
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:26,130
you radio the angel radio takes long

318
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,680
time

319
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:31,510
so they're saying four raspberries you

320
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,920
may go and say well this will take two

321
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:38,950
minutes no it's never that shirt well do

322
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:42,790
you take your time and well if you want

323
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:47,010
to replicate it well you will tell you

324
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:51,100
at least for the rubbers a full weekend

325
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:55,330
so this is how it works through a Python

326
00:22:51,100 --> 00:23:01,689
script we will just introduce them see

327
00:22:55,330 --> 00:23:06,429
culture then TR g sm life month so we

328
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:10,120
feel the GS in band and then also the

329
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:14,410
SDR device that we will be using if we

330
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,689
are talking about 3g and 4g we should

331
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:24,670
not forget that the maximum frequency

332
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:26,680
was 1766 / if I am at 2600 megahertz

333
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:32,230
I would never have reached that

334
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:35,500
frequency no matter how much I do and as

335
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:38,920
I say well we have up converters but if

336
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:41,380
we can play around with but we will soon

337
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:44,080
realize that we need significant

338
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,930
sampling and we also need a highly

339
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,830
accurate synchronization of the crystal

340
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:54,760
then we will soon realize that that will

341
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,340
not be helpful but when it comes to GMS

342
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,629
and having a good time this is good

343
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:05,050
enough and we also have Wireshark to

344
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:10,930
monitor all the a GSM tab and that is to

345
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:15,399
say well to start walking and now I'd

346
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:17,520
like to show you a demo I didn't show

347
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:22,370
you this antenna

348
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,370
you can see that hasn't spiralling it

349
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:30,270
this is for a different frequency bands

350
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:33,990
and again Judah need big antenna and

351
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:37,770
that antenna would be okay for 3G 4G and

352
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:43,169
the 2600 frequency band and then

353
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:46,279
regarding SD ours well this is of a

354
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:46,279
higher quality

355
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:55,260
and now to demo

356
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,240
[Music]

357
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:33,220
well apologies for that technical delay

358
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:39,609
alright we'll just plug in a USB we'll

359
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:42,269
be following the steps running it and

360
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:42,269
viewing it

361
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:55,020
with run it in a specific frequency and

362
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,910
I did my homework before and I've seen

363
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,230
that this frequency range this is the

364
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:03,090
same as in TV in Melaka we have

365
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,070
frequency ranges assigned her given out

366
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,320
to each of the couriers and does

367
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:13,889
frequency ranges may differ from those

368
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:24,120
or in Madrid or somewhere else and this

369
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:28,320
is what we should be aware of and this

370
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:31,879
is another typical antenna I'm sure you

371
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,649
are familiar with it

372
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:38,760
but this is not necessary but still I

373
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:45,210
just want to show it to you and now we

374
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:48,830
are seeing the GNU radio I starting to

375
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,830
receive signal

376
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:06,750
he tickles this signal this code is very

377
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:11,730
simple so this is identifying the

378
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:12,720
courier and then the famous 114 that I

379
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:19,470
mentioned before

380
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:22,289
- 140 referred so well in theory you

381
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:28,669
should not be seeing it okay it is to

382
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:34,110
imagination who is seeing that all right

383
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:40,890
what else could we do with that notice

384
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:48,240
this is GSM we said before that well GSM

385
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:52,110
is not just any more but who has mobile

386
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,860
phone block so that you can you only

387
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:59,820
operate in 4G well we don't do that

388
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:04,439
because we just want our mobile phone to

389
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:10,320
switch network as available so we just

390
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:12,600
don't want to but we just want to do

391
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,480
that for the sake of convenience some

392
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,620
for instance the taxi drivers when they

393
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:23,399
take out the point-of-sale payment

394
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:25,918
device and then they log on to the GSM

395
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:29,428
network and you say oh they are sending

396
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,350
in the era from my credit card where

397
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:35,170
some of those communications are

398
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:38,169
encrypted through protocol but

399
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:40,990
till well the protocol may have the in

400
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:44,380
progresses that it was invented so do

401
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,870
tender rainbow and you decode everything

402
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,790
any information that is going through

403
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,679
ish

404
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:53,470
for instance voice where we have a

405
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:56,140
number of control channels asking you to

406
00:28:53,470 --> 00:29:00,790
go there to go somewhere else and then

407
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:05,560
in this case with our SDR we can access

408
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:08,470
to a small sample we only have two mega

409
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:11,500
earths of bandwidth so that is two

410
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:15,700
minutes of samples per second and that

411
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:19,210
would not be enough okay so I haven't

412
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,610
wasted my time in checking and in

413
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:24,790
monitoring or tracking all that however

414
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:28,990
if we were to use other type of gadgets

415
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:32,500
available we could track much more than

416
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,780
that very easily so what could we do

417
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,330
with the information that we are seeing

418
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:43,530
on the screen

419
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:51,629
so why shock is now running so we have

420
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:58,600
GSM tap so we are detecting the protocol

421
00:29:51,630 --> 00:30:02,800
so we think geez um I don't know whether

422
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,520
you can see that or not but if I type in

423
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:11,399
all I see

424
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:15,090
this is a filter that is location area

425
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:19,740
code means that each of the cells is

426
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:22,199
sending II DNI and sending it its

427
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,080
parameters so if you are monitoring that

428
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:28,559
cell and if you are seeing the instance

429
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,139
in that cell you are seeing who is

430
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,620
connected there but if you go somewhere

431
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:37,260
else and monitor another cell and you

432
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,510
can see that this person here is also

433
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:51,840
connecting to that very same cell

434
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:54,679
well that that gives me a hint so this

435
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,678
is the cell identity

436
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:09,169
so each of the mobile towers when we

437
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,990
come out to the street we see they're

438
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:14,570
just ordinary mobile towers these were

439
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:17,600
allow us to see the cell identity and

440
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:20,679
actually we could even locate it and

441
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:27,699
here we have the location area

442
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:32,450
identification we see who is a larger

443
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:39,070
frequency alert - so Spain France called

444
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:39,070
Telecom and for that specific cell

445
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:50,600
okay I will stop that no longer

446
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,600
necessary

447
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:03,189
all right sighs someone's ago anything

448
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:07,330
illegal

449
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:11,830
all right I stopped that and I'm and

450
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:15,419
I'll move on with the presentation so we

451
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:23,260
have already been successful that's seen

452
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:33,730
something at least so I was talk about 2

453
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:38,920
G and what happens with LTE there is a

454
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:40,810
paper up there that we all follow these

455
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:46,780
compiles research carried out by other

456
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:50,379
people and that paper says that despite

457
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:57,100
common assumptions weather or reality

458
00:32:50,380 --> 00:33:01,260
unfortunately LTE of M C is always

459
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:07,090
transmitted in the clear at least once

460
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:10,420
well whenever conditions relevant

461
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:17,110
conditions are in place and in this case

462
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:20,640
we can use another SDR and this as your

463
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:23,409
culture is a bit it's more expensive

464
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:31,980
recent endeavors 10 euros whereas this

465
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:35,860
gadget it could be 600 700 euros but

466
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,870
still not very expensive compared to the

467
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:41,199
6 million euros that we mentioned before

468
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:43,860
this time we are talking about an LTAC

469
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,860
station

470
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:55,070
we could also jump that frequency that

471
00:33:51,560 --> 00:34:01,070
channel and then convert it into GSM

472
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:04,370
which is what we know how to but I said

473
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,659
well we have already one that is already

474
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,489
explained in the paper

475
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:12,350
the only thing we'll have to do it is to

476
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:15,949
follow it and to reproduce it and I can

477
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:20,380
assure you that it works so this is how

478
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:24,919
connection within node is being made and

479
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:29,270
then when we place well a fake our

480
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:33,320
telephone does not distinguish it the

481
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:36,050
same as Wi-Fi when a fake is introduced

482
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,830
well right away we will knock on there

483
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:42,980
well the same goes with is hella fun the

484
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:47,449
live phone connects to the most powerful

485
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:49,159
network just to save battery so it kind

486
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:53,419
of really differentiate whether it is

487
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:57,080
authentic or fake and for a long time

488
00:34:53,420 --> 00:35:00,470
now we've been trying to seeing whether

489
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:07,900
we can detect fakes or not

490
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:07,899
I remember once imageries

491
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:15,190
there were rumors about some of these

492
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:19,149
gadgets being around from BIA

493
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:22,130
straight so this allows us to extract

494
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:25,369
emceed from the messages the problem is

495
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:29,599
that to set that up do you need to emit

496
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:32,960
and because I cannot meet sorry I cannot

497
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:37,160
show you a demo sorry for that this is

498
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:41,390
MC capture no problem and these

499
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:43,549
continues to evolve this is from 2018

500
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:46,190
the previous one that I showed you was

501
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:50,780
from two years ago as I said this is

502
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:55,099
quite new more recent paper but it tells

503
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:59,080
us about the vulnerabilities so he

504
00:35:55,099 --> 00:36:00,920
repeats it because we knew about the

505
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:06,680
vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities

506
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:10,570
are repeated or show again Sophia we

507
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:16,810
have right on top identity requests and

508
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:19,580
now we also have service reject as I say

509
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:23,119
we continue to see vulnerability that

510
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:26,470
ever allow us to catch MC no problem

511
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:31,130
what are the problems that we have found

512
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:35,000
well Vanessa needs as well as budgets so

513
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:38,480
far posted several problems I was saying

514
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,280
that I am a specific frequency for

515
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,970
instance before I just 926 mega ads but

516
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,040
if I want to go to a different frequency

517
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:52,339
900 or over 900 I need a different

518
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,990
gadgets but if I wonder 928 what do I

519
00:36:52,339 --> 00:37:02,210
need I need another

520
00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:05,299
judge as you can easily imagine imagine

521
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:08,030
a TV imagine that you want to watch all

522
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,670
the TV stations simultaneously what do

523
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:17,660
you need what do we need several TV sets

524
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:20,330
and to have channel tuned in each of the

525
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,580
TV set so that Canon doesn't get

526
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:26,440
confused and knows how to differentiate

527
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:31,400
the various devices that we are using we

528
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:34,070
should break down those rules so that we

529
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,520
can connect several devices so that

530
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:42,020
different devices listen and so that we

531
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,830
can guide or lead the various projects

532
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:48,160
to point them at different devices 0 1 2

533
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,160
etc

534
00:37:51,060 --> 00:38:01,410
then imagine device who is using access

535
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:06,510
no we just want a helpless man if I'm

536
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:10,859
aware of in frequency having a working

537
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:14,000
on headless mode is enough and then we

538
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:17,730
move on to frequency we move on to

539
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:22,230
calibration and here we soon realize but

540
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:24,510
we need higher quality devices often I

541
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:30,630
talk about blades

542
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:37,310
these are STRs and actually a

543
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:40,380
prototypical one meet two JAMA this is

544
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:43,730
well one of the most typical ones we

545
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:48,510
have also others and the cost is around

546
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:51,900
6000 euros so this has 6,000 euros a

547
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:57,840
really nice device with a high sampling

548
00:38:51,900 --> 00:39:02,580
rate and then we can catch GPS signal

549
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:08,070
and there are things that you can never

550
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:11,009
do with a change gyro device and then

551
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:15,240
well also working with very many

552
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:19,590
LTS well this could be good for some

553
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:24,020
type of spoofing we could do that but we

554
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:26,160
are taking risks we are already nearing

555
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,790
anti-seize remember that this is

556
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,790
forbidden

557
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:35,149
so now we come back to the paper from

558
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:44,210
2016 what happens when there is a

559
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:47,660
location link yes the thing is that this

560
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:51,140
device could be tracked as I say finding

561
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:53,750
out where it is connected to if I get to

562
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,839
a location or if I make triangulation

563
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,670
which is a very simple mathematical

564
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,250
calculation you wouldn't really know

565
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:03,260
about the exact location but you would

566
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:06,470
know whether the person is closer to

567
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:11,480
here for a wave to here or I don't know

568
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:14,419
the person is a lot just traveling and

569
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:19,610
now we move on to jammers which has

570
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:22,240
signal inhibitors I always like to give

571
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:29,060
you the references here them apart from

572
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:31,490
2015 in this case a jammer and they said

573
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:36,320
frog is irate eight hundred to two

574
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:39,529
thousand and seven hundred power output

575
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:49,610
if we understand what it says so much it

576
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:53,030
allows this gsm 900 GPS or jism 1000 and

577
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:55,310
hundred we'll see what it is now the

578
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,790
providers we have the operators we have

579
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,790
in Spain

580
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:14,310
and it tells us the bandwidth we need 25

581
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:18,810
2015 norwich jam and inject noise this

582
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:24,779
is what I've explained before regarding

583
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:28,590
hack RF the bandwidth we get with her RF

584
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:31,820
is 20 minutes I can inject noise if I

585
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:35,970
want it's not exact

586
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:44,760
you can check noise occupying 20

587
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:51,859
megahertz with late RF is 28 and with

588
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:55,680
the others even more what can we do on

589
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:59,900
the one hand with DTS and a selective

590
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:04,529
SDR there's a project I love which is

591
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:09,270
multiple but what recovers information

592
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:14,220
from 2g 3G and 4G cells with a mobile

593
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:16,620
device I was going to say here Samsung

594
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,759
where we get several I use some Sun they

595
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:22,850
connect the cable and receive

596
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:26,100
information we choose the carrier

597
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:29,790
automatically or manually and we can

598
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:32,360
select the channel after that we make it

599
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:35,610
work and it tells you everything

600
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:38,150
frequencies of course we want to know

601
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,150
where they are

602
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:44,000
we can check where the frequencies are

603
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:58,780
and here any country in the world this

604
00:42:47,710 --> 00:43:01,620
is regulated that's why we can't emit we

605
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:04,600
have the national scheme of frequency

606
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:11,170
attribution that's why we had to change

607
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:14,950
TV T's when there was that mass and

608
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:18,400
ourselves we have a project which is

609
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:22,169
called sand mapper that's allows us to

610
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:29,170
identify whether you this is very easy

611
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:34,750
to gee-gees scanner it's going to tell

612
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:36,850
you where they were and for ATT you just

613
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,819
have to come here and it identifies

614
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:45,940
everything

615
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:49,420
here you see the results this is what we

616
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:53,949
have for specific carrier in this case

617
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:55,589
it starts put it at M on T whatever you

618
00:43:53,949 --> 00:44:00,839
want to call it

619
00:43:55,589 --> 00:44:00,839
these are the notes they have here

620
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:14,579
access number of frequencies bands were

621
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:22,808
using for GSM UMTS LT 19 band 3 which is

622
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:26,259
1800 plus and you can test play identify

623
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:29,219
but what channel another one another one

624
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:29,219
and then with the device

625
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:39,140
there's the information for you get

626
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:41,439
downlink frequency maybe we'll want to

627
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:46,029
inject Knights

628
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:49,240
therefore a non-selective as dr can find

629
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:51,850
the frequencies we want to cancel we

630
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,379
estimate the central frequency I want

631
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:57,970
this and this one has to be the central

632
00:44:53,380 --> 00:45:04,950
frequency bandwidth I inject notes we

633
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:10,390
generate caution noise this case with 20

634
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:16,540
megahertz a generator with regularity

635
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:20,470
our budget we here we have the frequency

636
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:25,680
we estimate it we make it port this is

637
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:31,500
what I did I'm not going to lie to you I

638
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:39,089
went to a shop Chinese own shop to look

639
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:39,090
for a portable fridge to become

640
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:47,700
to use it's a Faraday box because I'm

641
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:52,710
not allowed to emit this was the result

642
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,710
we managed to leave it outside the

643
00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:02,640
mobile is not left outside if for

644
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:09,310
canceling 4G signal it goes to 3G if we

645
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:12,220
cancel 3G it goes to GSM which is the

646
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:15,040
situation we had years ago protocols

647
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:21,250
which are broken what are we doing we

648
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:24,940
are using open source device something

649
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:28,839
you just plug and play that implement in

650
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:32,109
passive and active part it's modular it

651
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:36,099
includes jammer has databases can be

652
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:40,920
controlled remotely low-cost but they're

653
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:44,339
like this huge hardware manufacturer

654
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,339
starts with E

655
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:50,680
and maybe so

656
00:46:53,450 --> 00:47:00,960
well let's see this with the men in

657
00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:03,960
black we may open the project so that

658
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,960
everyone uses it or its person knowing

659
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,990
the basis you can do it for yourself

660
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:18,330
it's not complicated but this was a

661
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:29,330
prototype so that you can see how it

662
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:29,330
works you're going to show it let's see

663
00:47:47,460 --> 00:48:02,140
I'll enlarge it uno dos tres cuatro

664
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:06,660
Cinco seis a dojo one two three four

665
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,660
five six seven eight

666
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:19,260
this is the gadget we press Start and of

667
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:19,259
course no device

668
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:29,100
you need to connect this I'm going to do

669
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:29,100
this but then since its low-cost

670
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:47,770
it's recognized the device no cost this

671
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:58,420
is the information you know what can we

672
00:48:47,770 --> 00:49:03,220
do we can scan etc but we should look

673
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:08,049
for the cells we press here and what's

674
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:10,709
behind this we're mapping not just

675
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:10,710
Malaga

676
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:22,640
but we may have requests from everywhere

677
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:25,310
research yourself in order to speed up

678
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:29,720
the process

679
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:33,230
this is GSM just GSM and it takes very

680
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:35,839
long time but we combined this but the

681
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:42,560
frequencies was observed with the

682
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:53,090
information with crawled here he detects

683
00:49:42,560 --> 00:50:02,320
these two data that we had before and in

684
00:49:53,090 --> 00:50:02,320
this case this is Madrid this is mobile

685
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:19,629
I'm going to make it smaller but not

686
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:22,720
that much that would be where we are and

687
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:28,470
here these are the cells

688
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:34,350
the device has detected this usually

689
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:34,350
depends on the IP we have

690
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:55,910
I mean I walk around a while ago and I

691
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,910
saw it

692
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:04,880
here well it's been pointed I didn't get

693
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:08,000
to do this but this one at the bottom

694
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:11,490
you see it if you go out to your right

695
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:19,650
you'll see a repeater with three antenna

696
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:24,560
which is what we are receiving so this

697
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:24,560
for this carry and if we combine this

698
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:43,390
this is HTTP this is from another

699
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:43,390
project

700
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:53,880
instead the data and it shows what it is

701
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:57,610
you Cheers everything what am i

702
00:51:53,880 --> 00:52:00,739
interested in what do we want now

703
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:00,739
[Music]

704
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,200
I want to scan

705
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:15,888
[Music]

706
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:21,779
if I want to scan something else I

707
00:52:15,889 --> 00:52:27,919
answered other device whatever I press

708
00:52:21,779 --> 00:52:27,919
and I receive in for the information

709
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:45,740
what do we have here databases with IMS

710
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:50,420
eyes and the people there are and just

711
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:59,020
in case we have integrated different

712
00:52:50,420 --> 00:53:03,740
queries to HR record some providers some

713
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:04,250
carriers gave you the IMS I'd just like

714
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,040
that

715
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:10,750
why don't we check it if you know the

716
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:15,140
mobile phone and you can check the IMS I

717
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:18,350
you know this from is from this person

718
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:23,480
it means that he or she is here so it

719
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:26,270
could search and we're get check if you

720
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:28,430
want to try with your phone to see the

721
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:31,690
data will receive any volunteer

722
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:31,690
[Music]

723
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:38,299
Conte you need to come up to write it

724
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:50,650
well but I am you buy I'm going to use

725
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:53,069
my number so that we don't have any

726
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:53,069
problem

727
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:57,810
because sometimes they've linked her

728
00:53:55,170 --> 00:54:06,360
name it wasn't supposed to this is

729
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:15,299
information it's going to come out a

730
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:20,670
query to your consultation server can

731
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:27,750
you see it yes here and the data here

732
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:31,830
the I am miss I is telling me 204 teams

733
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:38,520
here are three five four that's not my

734
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:42,240
ions as I this is a public server we

735
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:48,600
would have seized and sands where you

736
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:54,089
are some provide those numbers in the

737
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:57,930
same query what I'm going to do is using

738
00:54:54,090 --> 00:55:01,130
some things that are open there that are

739
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,129
properly secured

740
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:14,629
I'm going to ask it to mix all the

741
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:17,480
information and tests were here

742
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:20,779
this could be more precise but I haven't

743
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:22,809
mapped each of the towers we have the de

744
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:26,349
Provence

745
00:55:22,809 --> 00:55:26,349
but that's enough

746
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:55,288
what's this when we use the active plant

747
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:57,199
we combine this for GSM but listening to

748
00:55:55,289 --> 00:55:59,729
this frequency and this other it

749
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:04,400
configures virtually everything

750
00:55:59,729 --> 00:56:08,968
automatically so that you can also have

751
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:13,579
GPS I'm sure you want data you want your

752
00:56:08,969 --> 00:56:17,669
IP address your voice service and

753
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:25,439
absolutely everything and we even have

754
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:31,939
the record and it allows you to cross

755
00:56:25,439 --> 00:56:31,939
data and you can do many more things

756
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:43,290
this is what I can tell you I like to

757
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:56,010
thank you and we open the Tyrian hey do

758
00:56:43,290 --> 00:57:00,300
you have any question I'll be around so

759
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:02,579
you can ask me things later I just

760
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:07,280
wanted to know whether you know the good

761
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:07,280
book to learn about mobile networks

762
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:15,069
this echo I got out here do you know

763
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:20,010
about any book in order to know more

764
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:20,009
about mobile networks and all this

765
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:33,210
book about mobile networks yes there are

766
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:37,369
many the publishing house Jamis

767
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:46,470
publishing house you have likes book on

768
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:49,880
telecommunications 20 euro 22 I activate

769
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:54,598
Jose Pico both brothers it's very good

770
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:56,490
anyway I like to recommend to you

771
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:59,250
strongly recommended if you're

772
00:57:56,490 --> 00:58:02,490
interested in this topic you should read

773
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:05,760
the papers but do not install any

774
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:08,549
hardware until you understand what the

775
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:13,010
papers say because otherwise you're

776
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:16,020
going to waste your time big time

777
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:17,700
because you see how things work because

778
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:20,330
we have done it because we've already

779
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:25,279
been there were already wasted our time

780
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:26,590
and not was not just little time

781
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,000
[Music]

782
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:35,440
and not cars motorcycles and many

783
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,750
devices are using GPS and while I guess

784
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,300
they have cheap contract to have data

785
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:44,020
transmission real-time was banned do

786
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:51,130
they use and how do you identify it if

787
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:56,380
you can identify it because motorcycles

788
00:58:51,130 --> 00:59:02,460
are devices out 40 years a car yes

789
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:06,310
for example that carriers that for IOT

790
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,720
they have a same that they connect to

791
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:10,360
networks and they said everything that

792
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,069
the same and that scariest register

793
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:16,570
because otherwise they wouldn't be able

794
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:19,060
to operate but here there's the problem

795
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:20,920
carrots are safe but if there's another

796
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:27,540
price which is in turn connected to them

797
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:27,540
and they fail it's complex

798
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:34,690
and identifying two which were exactly

799
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:37,900
connected one would want to say I would

800
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:41,080
like to thank you I would like to say

801
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:42,570
that if you want to learn follow his

802
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:47,440
page

803
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:49,030
thank you was quite the gift once it's

804
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,860
up and running

805
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:56,740
I hope Monday Tuesday if you can he

806
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:59,980
should follow him pickets among the top

807
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:03,879
ones not just in Spain but also in the

808
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:07,330
world country loves me a lot has been my

809
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:13,720
teacher there are many things we can

810
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:16,779
learn from him thank you very much it's

811
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:19,299
just opened his website he didn't have a

812
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:22,360
website until very recently I would like

813
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:26,460
