00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:20,869
I would thank you sure sorry for your

00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:25,459
presentation I would like to say that

4
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:30,350
I'm delighted to be here today it's a

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:33,140
pleasure being here at home this event

6
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,020
of a likes it's a Cybercom Tatyana the

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,090
organizing committee of cyber camp for

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,760
making it possible for me to be here I

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,650
live a bit far from here I've been

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,780
living there for in the US for four

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,269
years but the rest of my life I have

12
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:51,140
left here so when I was they called me

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,760
before summer saying asking whether I

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,010
was interested in giving the lecture

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,969
here I said yes immediately my name is

16
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,430
Ismail Valenzuela

17
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:02,180
you can follow me in Twitter try to be

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,160
quite active there so you can use it

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,890
during the presentation I've been

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,090
working in this for almost 20 years in

21
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:13,610
this same city not far from here I

22
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,850
created a company with other people and

23
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,310
mentioned later on because there's a lot

24
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,190
of talent here in malaga and throughout

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:26,659
the years they've worked in many things

26
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:30,210
that may sound familiar for us we're

27
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:34,490
going to give them our voice

28
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:38,610
I started in 2001 I've worked in

29
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:41,759
security now I quote from ography I've

30
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,299
worked with them for the last six years

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:50,300
last four in the US I would like to

32
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,920
speak not just about my experience but

33
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,259
through my experience I've had over the

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,149
past years I would like to explain some

35
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,860
things that worked for me and for those

36
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,720
of you who are interested in marketing

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,119
cyber security or perhaps you're already

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,519
doing some things these things may be

39
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:12,239
useful to have a career or consider

40
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:13,890
other things you may do one of the first

41
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,720
things I would like to tell you about

42
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:23,540
its what meaning I gave to the world

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:27,510
hacker truth to be told its connotations

44
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:29,100
are a bit different compared to the one

45
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,989
the connotations are had in the past

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:36,170
when we say hacker we understand

47
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:39,769
virtually a criminal someone who

48
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:43,350
accesses another system another computer

49
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:46,890
without authorization and it steals data

50
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:49,410
and uses them with legal purposes but

51
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,859
the original definition of hacker was a

52
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,209
different one very recently I attended a

53
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,900
conference with water

54
00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:00,900
Isaacson who wrote a series of

55
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,180
interested interesting books he is known

56
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,480
in the u.s. because he wrote Steve Jobs

57
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:10,110
biography and in this

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,629
but innovators he speaks about the

59
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:17,069
people that change the industry

60
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:20,579
computing microchips computers the

61
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:25,349
internet people like Trump all human Ada

62
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:28,830
Lovelace Bill Gates and he explains how

63
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:31,679
these people were originally hackers but

64
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,079
not hackers in the sense of accessing

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,390
other computers illegally but hackers in

66
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:40,049
the sense that they did things that

67
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:46,980
seemed impossible they were geniuses the

68
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:50,040
word hacker comes from a group of freaks

69
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,899
geeks there were technical people they

70
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:58,620
belong to a group electrical train

71
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:03,750
modeling in the MIT in Boston and in the

72
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:06,599
40s these people among them the were a

73
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,220
series of people that just wanted trains

74
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,418
to look good and everything looked

75
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:17,039
pretty to brag about it and others were

76
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:21,870
interested in seeing what was going on

77
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:24,450
below the model the cables commuters the

78
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,430
electrical part of it so they weren't

79
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,539
back then there were no circuits the way

80
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,910
we know it today

81
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:32,340
you know them today but they wanted to

82
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,120
know how this worked this curiosity is

83
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,388
part of the hacker philosophy knowing

84
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:44,130
how things work dismantle them some of

85
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:46,620
them again and they reached they found a

86
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,430
hack some trick something intelligent

87
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:52,080
that may not be elegant but it made that

88
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,479
object that perhaps was not designed

89
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,990
with that purpose worked in a different

90
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,969
way

91
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,409
sometimes it was even a joke

92
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:03,689
over the past years I've worked with

93
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:05,129
people that worked with this person in

94
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:11,639
the 40s Grace Hopper

95
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:14,219
she was called Amazing Grace and she's

96
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,439
known because she was the first person

97
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:19,409
that invented she was a person that

98
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,679
invented compilers if you use compilers

99
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:28,949
the person that invented this was this

100
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:31,409
person she was a mathematician in the

101
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:35,969
forties she worked for Harvard

102
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:39,889
University and she embodied the original

103
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:39,889
hacker spirit she was seven and she

104
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:46,409
disassembled the clocks she found around

105
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:49,318
and she wanted to know how the clocks

106
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:53,188
worked she wanted to know about the

107
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:55,769
mechanism her mother said that after the

108
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:57,269
ninth clock she said okay stop I'll

109
00:05:55,769 --> 00:06:01,199
explain you how it works

110
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:03,240
and one of the things she said and this

111
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,749
is part of the hacker philosophy hackers

112
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:12,169
periods not being comfortable with

113
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,169
something

114
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:17,709
they don't think that things had what

115
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:21,639
the same way all the time and sin if

116
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:24,330
things work please don't touch it this

117
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,249
was this nonconformity with things and

118
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,318
they said you need to try different ways

119
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:34,659
of doing things that's the basis of

120
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:37,089
innovation group DVD not just accepting

121
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:41,649
how things have been done your whole

122
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:44,469
life one of her most famous quotes is

123
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:49,599
that in order to think differently

124
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:53,289
she had a clock on the wall which was

125
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:57,808
working antique clock wise you know that

126
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:57,808
she wanted to think about this

127
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:09,620
she was a bit of a rebel she was against

128
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:14,179
established things age 34 she joined the

129
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,320
US Navy she waited for killers she was

130
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,760
poking us below their wild minimum white

131
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,469
back then so if you have the opportunity

132
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,469
to read this book it's interesting but

133
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,480
this somehow romantic definition of

134
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,990
hacker it's not the one we have today

135
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:33,350
today the finish and we have it's more

136
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:38,710
like this something that creates

137
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:42,700
fascinations but also fear the terrorist

138
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:45,919
actions behind this some governments

139
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:52,190
with very bad intentions industrial

140
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:55,820
espionage run somewhere you may have

141
00:07:52,190 --> 00:08:00,200
suffered that audio system military

142
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:05,540
groups the famous apts persistent

143
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:07,639
advanced threats thinks that we hear

144
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,530
about menus

145
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:16,539
we have journalists devoted to

146
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:20,809
cybersecurity where mr. graves blog in

147
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:25,688
the US he's always sharing news about

148
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,689
criminal groups advanced attacks etc

149
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:34,969
over the past years we see on the news

150
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:37,929
always the same thing there was there's

151
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:40,659
always something related to elections

152
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:43,870
governments interested in modifying

153
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:46,790
election results hacking in Russia

154
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:52,010
against the US that's something that's

155
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:54,680
on the news on the papers years ago this

156
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:57,980
was unthinkable and today it's part of a

157
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,219
daily life and as the Secretary of State

158
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:04,130
and the percent of Debus said we have an

159
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,380
increasing need of professionals and

160
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:10,660
security and the fact that you're here

161
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:13,880
today and this room is packed confirms

162
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,040
that security is something important

163
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,199
there are many people interested in

164
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,569
entering the cybersecurity world the

165
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:27,229
statistics say that in 2019 1.5 million

166
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:31,010
professionals will be needed 1.5 more

167
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:33,260
professionals than the offer we have so

168
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,199
if you're interested in working in this

169
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,329
field there will be jobs for you in the

170
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:41,990
future some of the statistics say that

171
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:45,040
in 2021 the shortage will be twice at

172
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,040
number three million

173
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:51,610
though many professionals and

174
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:54,750
cybersecurity so many years people have

175
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,310
asked me oh how did you start and

176
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,649
cybersecurity I would like to share some

177
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,660
of these things and give you some

178
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:04,810
recommendations I want them I don't want

179
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:07,630
to say advice because you have to choose

180
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:12,670
your own path but some things that have

181
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:15,250
been helpful for me and after some years

182
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:22,240
oh that this thing I did I didn't think

183
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:24,490
it was important but it was actually one

184
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:32,589
of the things that we are seeing is a

185
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:36,910
great demand not only part of public and

186
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:41,620
private companies so this is a company

187
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:44,560
in California asking for or posting a

188
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:49,990
job listing for a person experiencing

189
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,560
Hadoop and this is asking that person to

190
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,700
have more than six years of experience

191
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,029
so did not get desperate

192
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,740
in many cases employers or recruiters

193
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:02,560
that know what they are talking about

194
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,830
because this technology is only six

195
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,650
years old so therefore there is no one

196
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:13,839
with more years than more than nine

197
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:17,290
years of experience in these fields or

198
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:20,800
technology so well there are new things

199
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:25,569
all the time up there and we all have to

200
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,729
be updated including employers so and

201
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,180
now I'd like to share with you some

202
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,180
hacks

203
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:40,779
and takeaway message from this

204
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:43,360
presentation is think like a hacker

205
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:49,420
that is to say make possible something

206
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:51,910
that looks som impossible today first of

207
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,240
all and which is very much related to

208
00:11:51,910 --> 00:12:02,680
hacking philosophy is big theorists have

209
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:06,430
a curiosity in things and here and well

210
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,250
when I had when my first PC I better

211
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:13,420
body to me when I was 13 years old my

212
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:16,500
father bought olive 80286 it had 1

213
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:22,750
megabyte ram memory and 14 megabytes

214
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:25,570
hard drive i remember at a time had a

215
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,930
friend he went like 40 megabytes hard

216
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:32,589
drive you will never have a feel it yeah

217
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:36,040
you're laughing at a teasing it so

218
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:40,150
nowadays we will fill up that hard drive

219
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,040
with just with an attachment with power

220
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:46,060
purpose situation but at that time that

221
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:50,319
was a huge storage capacity I remember

222
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:53,079
the floppy disk from ms5 we didn't even

223
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,430
have windows at a time and I was paying

224
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:00,180
around with basic and well those

225
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:03,969
programs they will be referred as

226
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,219
artificial intelligence ok they well the

227
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,860
computers asking me my name and rapidity

228
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:12,070
it and I was like fascinated as it was

229
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,860
my computer is talking to me and as I

230
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:18,700
say I was more and more curious and to

231
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:21,699
all that I started reading and then we

232
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:26,049
had Windows 3.1 with floppy disks

233
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:29,529
you use well the program came in

234
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:36,819
installation floppy disks several of

235
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:40,329
them but we didn't even have mouths time

236
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:43,439
when windows were released we used to

237
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:52,738
love answer antennas from the modem

238
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:55,929
causing significant noise and as I say I

239
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:59,980
started to be curious and I wanted to

240
00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:02,980
find out how all that worked so this is

241
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,779
the curiosity that drives hackers

242
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,999
forward what happens when you change the

243
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,549
bit or in the capacity of a protocol

244
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:14,739
what happens when that package that goes

245
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:17,139
through the network is changed and I was

246
00:14:14,739 --> 00:14:20,769
extremely interested in finding out what

247
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:25,389
this was all about so those of you who

248
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:29,679
are older may remember finally this set

249
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:33,489
of manuals in the on the internet so

250
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:36,189
Carling manual does it sound familiar to

251
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:43,419
any of you well I have something we are

252
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:45,839
do here so this was controversial in the

253
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,839
US

254
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:54,249
and this type of guidance were known as

255
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:59,169
harmless hacking guide to harmless

256
00:14:54,249 --> 00:15:01,479
hacking so actually this was I helped to

257
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:03,669
understand how the internet and

258
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:09,069
protocols worked so at that time we

259
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:10,899
started to have email and what I learned

260
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:14,019
in these guides I could see that through

261
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:19,109
tell that I could connect to 425 on that

262
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:23,739
email server where I could read my email

263
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:27,159
just by typing a command line to me that

264
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:30,509
was fascinating nothing to do with

265
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:33,819
nowadays talking but that curiosity

266
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:38,019
helped me learn how these protocols and

267
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:42,608
things and that works the my

268
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:46,329
presentation will be available as if you

269
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:52,259
are interested in finding out more well

270
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:59,699
you may get hold of these publications

271
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:59,699
back from 1995 tell many male parts etc

272
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:09,620
and also around that time I started to

273
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:13,699
learn more about liners operation system

274
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:17,750
and when there was a group of people at

275
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:24,019
university who were training other

276
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:27,019
people all Linux after teaching hours so

277
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:29,449
I started with ms2 with comment 9 and

278
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:33,920
then I could see that while using mouse

279
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:37,609
was like too simple so I just and Linux

280
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,209
and I need to implement many of the

281
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:44,779
things that I was learning through these

282
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:53,268
guides and as I say I got together with

283
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:55,880
these group of people and then at that

284
00:16:53,269 --> 00:17:01,010
time there were also I offered

285
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:04,160
I volunteered to create a website and I

286
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:08,569
bought my facebook old HTML and I

287
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,640
started to learn about PHP databases was

288
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,678
not exactly something that I was

289
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:18,410
learning at university but anyway I was

290
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:23,449
curious about set I was 30 or university

291
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:26,500
technical engineering degree and then I

292
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:31,340
saw an ad fortunately I don't have

293
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:33,320
photography but the ad said if you can

294
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,159
understand this we will hire you and

295
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:41,928
that was covering PHP using a database

296
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:44,720
and because her some clue about sit and

297
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,850
new work was about and I was there with

298
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,309
a friend and I say oh that's a database

299
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,320
and I said ok please what send in your

300
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:53,370
CV and I said well I'm still at

301
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:58,830
university I don't think they will

302
00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:03,209
consider it and I well then I gave it a

303
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:08,970
thought I said well why not sending in

304
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:10,110
my CV so that day came home and I wrote

305
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,600
my CV

306
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,540
well had no experience but I just told

307
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,629
him what I was doing but I was playing

308
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:22,470
around with practicing centre in and

309
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:25,260
then when I came back home later on my

310
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:28,580
mother told me you got a call from a

311
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:32,840
company who is interested in meeting you

312
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:35,730
so I visited I went to the company

313
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:40,649
Monday and then they gave me a job

314
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:43,800
part-time in the morning had that job

315
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,840
and then in the afternoon and just to go

316
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,659
to university and it gave me a great

317
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,320
opportunity to put into practice many of

318
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:56,130
the things that had learnt and that I

319
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:00,210
was learning I'm really glad to see here

320
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:04,920
some of my colleagues in that company at

321
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:09,050
that time so we started a project known

322
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:13,200
as top football calm and way before that

323
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:17,850
1999 five years before Facebook was

324
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:22,070
launched in Malaga digital platform was

325
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:25,679
being created with reaffirmed you could

326
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:30,419
sign in and create your own profile and

327
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:32,970
that platform was fascinated and then

328
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:36,570
the company they asked me to be

329
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:41,460
responsible for the service applications

330
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:44,000
have web server database servers as of

331
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:50,929
course that

332
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:56,090
well these data had to be protected and

333
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:56,090
everything that I was learning by myself

334
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:07,520
could be put into practice as a result

335
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:10,799
of that and then also interesting and

336
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,510
I'd like to share with you at the

337
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:18,720
University there was a group hop Huck u

338
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:21,720
ma and it was not a group created to

339
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,140
hockey University but just to share

340
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:32,610
information about IT security so this

341
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:36,950
was back in 1996 97 98 some of the

342
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:41,389
people in the group were University

343
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:45,860
students and one of them in the firm

344
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:49,740
posted we have found a vulnerability in

345
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:51,600
public administration and city please

346
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:57,780
take a look at it and then again

347
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:02,939
curiosity we got really curious and the

348
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:05,879
problem that they had was not that the

349
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,039
actual server has been hacked it was

350
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,620
hosted here in a company in the

351
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:13,200
industrial park and then it was he had

352
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,080
mean that had made a mistake and had

353
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,270
index the number of data that did not

354
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,720
belong to the public administration

355
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:24,570
entity where you could just log in the

356
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,620
website and then you could do search and

357
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:31,620
you could get to data

358
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:34,860
hustling other servers that are say of

359
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:37,909
that full reputation so to speak and

360
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:43,949
then we took a look at all that and

361
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:49,830
because I knew about Internet security I

362
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:52,140
could see that the that port 1 4 3 3 was

363
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,530
exposed to the Internet and do you know

364
00:21:52,140 --> 00:22:02,130
what afternoon you can find in this port

365
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:04,260
well SQL databases so that should not be

366
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,940
there that that person should not have

367
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:11,940
been exposed because often there are

368
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:16,020
firewalls up but the problem was greater

369
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:19,770
than that so do you remember that ID

370
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:22,889
enzyme you used to install SQL juicer

371
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:25,470
Server 2000 and when you were doing the

372
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:28,530
installation they asked you to enter a

373
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:31,470
password for the at new for the system

374
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:38,280
admin but the problem was that third

375
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:40,740
passport was optional as you can see it

376
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,309
was highly recommended to and a

377
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:47,730
non-black new password which is kind of

378
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:52,470
unthinkable today many people in the

379
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:56,580
nethack service with no protection

380
00:22:52,470 --> 00:23:00,330
whatsoever and anyone could log in to

381
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:05,639
the server only by using the username as

382
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:09,289
a and rest of the servers in that public

383
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,559
administration entity were also exposed

384
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:16,549
but to summarize

385
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:22,168
well at that time that was made big news

386
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:25,139
and when I found that out I talked to

387
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:29,129
the people who were responsible for that

388
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:33,839
service they solved the problem right

389
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:38,009
away they closed the port and then the

390
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:42,149
CEO two of the G to group the company

391
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:46,619
where I was working get the opportunity

392
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:50,208
to offer this type of Red Team Services

393
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:53,728
or ethical hacking so this type of

394
00:23:50,209 --> 00:23:57,749
advice to be provided companies who

395
00:23:53,729 --> 00:24:01,949
wanted to be secure and now we are

396
00:23:57,749 --> 00:24:04,229
talking about the end of 2000 and 2001

397
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:07,699
when there were only few companies in

398
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:15,799
this country offering this type of

399
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:19,559
services it was where we were pioneers

400
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:21,389
to speaker now when we look back well we

401
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:24,800
could see that we were the first company

402
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:30,360
to offer these services

403
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:33,330
and now what color free comment to you

404
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:38,490
well this is a photograph in the garbage

405
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:41,850
of my home and well I always have some

406
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:44,190
time of machine at home so nowadays it

407
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:48,120
is much easier to do we have the cloud

408
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:51,390
and this is an Intel nook which is very

409
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:54,209
small PC like size of a book where you

410
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:57,360
can run virtual machines and my

411
00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:02,040
suggestion is set up your own lab find

412
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:04,379
them machine which is called I don't

413
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:10,040
know that you only useful video gaming

414
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:14,070
and that you can use to create your lab

415
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:19,260
install the access which is a free

416
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:22,639
program that you may install in any PC

417
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:28,050
and where you can create your own net

418
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:31,290
install that from scratch challenges -

419
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:35,250
from scratch compile download from the

420
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:36,270
sources it will be painful it will not

421
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,520
work right away

422
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,070
you will have to devote time to it but

423
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,670
by doing that to learning how things

424
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:46,850
work this is the hacking philosophy that

425
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,120
is to say knowing how things work from

426
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:52,860
trached

427
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:58,260
create a small well Windows domain you

428
00:25:52,860 --> 00:26:01,350
may use it for some time and you will be

429
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,450
kind of creating something which is very

430
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:07,949
similar to network in the company and

431
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:10,980
then try to secure it so use the butter

432
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,680
stations in Linux and once we've done

433
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,440
that try to hack the system and see

434
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,050
which is the hash the evidence that is

435
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,760
left behind so that you better

436
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,280
understand where they are the action

437
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:26,370
needs of organizations out there and if

438
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,450
something is well if you find something

439
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,629
unexpected

440
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:42,599
celebrated because variously will help

441
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:45,070
you out in the future nowadays I can see

442
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:49,178
many young people wanted to become

443
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:52,889
hackers knowing how to hack things but

444
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:55,989
sometimes we forget where we come from

445
00:26:52,889 --> 00:27:01,359
and learning from history is not about

446
00:26:55,989 --> 00:27:07,149
learning how to work in a switchboard or

447
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:12,309
anything like that but now I would like

448
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:16,089
to recommend this book to you cliff

449
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:21,149
Stoll was physic working for Berkeley

450
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:25,200
California and he was not a good

451
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:33,549
physicist and he was sent out to the IT

452
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:37,119
lab and I said ok well let us see if he

453
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:41,139
better performs there and then when the

454
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:43,689
IT guys were he joined a group of them

455
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:45,428
he said ok I think well he's not very

456
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,729
good at computers but he's a good

457
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:53,179
physicist so later on about something

458
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:56,419
about marketing how to sell yourself

459
00:27:53,179 --> 00:28:00,979
well he was asked to take care of an

460
00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:03,859
accounting system so imagine at that

461
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:06,049
time this person was working for the

462
00:28:03,859 --> 00:28:09,019
university they were a researcher and

463
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:13,179
you were using big frames huge computers

464
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:14,839
to logging you had to run your

465
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:21,799
applications you have to make

466
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:25,849
calculations and after that you received

467
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:30,080
kind of like payment slip saying what

468
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:33,489
this is huh this is the bill okay this

469
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:37,699
is how much you have spent okay

470
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:40,879
and therefore you pay per use and then

471
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:46,479
we really accountability of this system

472
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:51,949
he detected that the numbers didn't work

473
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:55,129
wake up and then there was that or six

474
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:57,859
seventy cents that is to say someone has

475
00:28:55,129 --> 00:29:01,389
used the lab and hadn't been charged for

476
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:05,359
that we're talking about 70 cents only

477
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:09,379
which is like a minor amount of money

478
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:11,349
but because he had a hacking mindset is

479
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:14,209
that okay I'm going to research this and

480
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:18,589
I said well I will just have a good time

481
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:23,299
and then I will learn about the system

482
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:28,559
I'm not going to tell you everything

483
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:31,889
that happens but when you're later

484
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:36,120
it happened that Markos highs was

485
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:38,758
arrested in Germany and he was a person

486
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,219
who was logging in he was an

487
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:44,429
unauthorized person and he was hacking

488
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,340
the servers partly University and all

489
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:50,669
that jumped through the ARPANET which

490
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,259
was just a network connecting bringing

491
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:54,870
together a number of universities and

492
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:57,990
the government's in the US and from

493
00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:01,619
there it jumped to the Department of

494
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:06,059
Defense in the u.s. from where this

495
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:08,850
criminal was stealing sensitive data

496
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:12,990
from military projects selling that out

497
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:16,709
through the KJV okay Russian spies and

498
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:21,299
in exchange of money and cocaine so that

499
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:24,869
was 1986 so nothing to do with the IPTS

500
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:26,879
that we are seeing nowadays but ok this

501
00:30:24,869 --> 00:30:28,649
is nothing new but nowadays we know much

502
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:30,600
more about it with this I mean that all

503
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:33,209
this started a long time ago

504
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,730
so well if you read this book you will

505
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,440
not find many information about the

506
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,440
tools that you use because there were no

507
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,659
intrusion intruders detection or

508
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,320
artificial intelligence but same

509
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:50,129
situation attackers defenders and always

510
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,769
people behind all that strategies or

511
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:55,168
even the tactics haven't changed that

512
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:58,259
much and he did something that were

513
00:30:55,169 --> 00:31:00,749
using nowadays Hani pots so this idea

514
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:03,659
was used by this person before he

515
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:09,929
created a fake military projects and put

516
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:13,470
it in that IT system so that the raka

517
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:16,529
attacker when there tried to download a

518
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,749
file and because it was a large file it

519
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:21,869
took the attacker a long time to

520
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:24,509
download the file and then as the

521
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:28,320
attacker was downloading the file FBI

522
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:30,580
and police forces in Europe managed to

523
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,769
trace this guy

524
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:40,428
in Germany so this is not about rules

525
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:45,529
this is just about your mindset and this

526
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:47,480
guy is a clear example of that so it's

527
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:54,259
important to know history history shows

528
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:58,159
you the basics so well sometimes I'm

529
00:31:54,259 --> 00:32:01,370
tired of people trying to pretend that

530
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,159
what we do is extremely difficult that

531
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:07,729
it is rocket science as they say in the

532
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,490
US this is not rocket science this is

533
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:13,190
not patent physics this is not that

534
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:17,240
complex not at all the only thing they

535
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:21,159
need to know is be aware of basics so I

536
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:25,100
have a friend who is a sense fellow

537
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:26,809
well-known ethical hacking and he says

538
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,500
the following information security is

539
00:32:26,809 --> 00:32:33,049
nothing but the inspired application of

540
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,750
fundamentals first of all you have to be

541
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:37,549
aware of fundamentals and then knowing

542
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:41,090
how to apply them and this is what you

543
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:42,710
get from experience but often we don't

544
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,418
have the experience because no one has

545
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,519
given us opportunity to gain and

546
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,649
experience that's why it becomes all the

547
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,040
more important to create to set up your

548
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:54,520
own lab at home and

549
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:58,840
experiment with all that what about

550
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:01,629
learning fundamentals practical person

551
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:04,899
I'd like to offer this list of

552
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:07,990
references to you as I said you will be

553
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:12,880
receiving my presentations so this is a

554
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:14,559
long list of books to read for life you

555
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,570
will not have to read them all but

556
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:22,418
they've been classified as passing

557
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:25,899
advanced AI themes to sit in learning

558
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:30,700
about networks os

559
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:32,370
I have to thank Javier Lopez from the

560
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,750
University of Manila who was my teacher

561
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:37,540
for many years he's been having a

562
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:41,080
wonderful work in the shadow teaching

563
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:44,620
people at a time when people say tcp/ip

564
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,270
all this is really boring after years

565
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,280
I've realized that there were the

566
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,540
fundamentals if you are not aware of the

567
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,809
fundamentals if you're not aware of

568
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:58,379
protocols principles heathers how they

569
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:58,379
work very unlikely you will succeed

570
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,750
doing any hacking the end of the day

571
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,280
everything goes through the network is

572
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,790
very important to understand how

573
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:12,759
networks in ask windows work so these

574
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:16,029
are the fundamentals analysis

575
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,970
methodologies nowadays the industry in

576
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:22,109
general is investing huge amounts of

577
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,109
money in

578
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:30,810
Hot Topic nowadays is security operating

579
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:33,150
centers that is to say having a security

580
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:35,400
organization people are monitoring what

581
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:38,960
is happening on a daily basis to defend

582
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:42,679
themselves from attackers response

583
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:46,740
incidents forensic analysis intelligence

584
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:49,380
and I want to well some people say I

585
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,939
want to do intelligence well that

586
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,530
requires understanding of the

587
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,850
fundamentals but also to have a

588
00:34:52,530 --> 00:35:00,060
strategic thinking and this is about

589
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:03,810
knowing impact of all that has in your

590
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:08,850
business and on that that goes beyond

591
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:11,850
the technology side of it and you can

592
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:16,160
find all that in books it's very

593
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,160
important to get trained and also know

594
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:24,810
when you have a problem that to be

595
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:26,460
analyzed how to have an open mind to

596
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:29,080
areas

597
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,530
think like a hacker

598
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,210
think about what you are seeing have you

599
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,330
seen it before you may have seen it

600
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,400
before but may not be similar hypothesis

601
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:44,319
hypothesis generation there is a method

602
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:49,870
which is very interesting seh analysis

603
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,510
of competing hypotheses you may visit my

604
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:54,359
website I have

605
00:35:51,510 --> 00:36:00,630
mentioned that or that is a first in my

606
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:04,200
website so CIA offers steps to carry out

607
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:07,560
investigations and that you can use in

608
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,819
your research this is more about

609
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,130
psychology

610
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,830
however brain works how to analyze

611
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:16,110
complex situations this is a situation

612
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:19,520
you will find yourselves in when you

613
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:23,010
will be defending the security of an

614
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,990
organization the recommendation is then

615
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:33,030
at least two programming languages Bosch

616
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:36,629
Linux PowerShell Windows and as I say

617
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:42,290
even in to get PowerShell Windows

618
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:45,390
PowerShell team saucers now with the IOT

619
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:48,660
well these languages are widely used

620
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:52,410
nowadays especially now with cloud

621
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:59,220
services everything is going to cloud

622
00:36:52,410 --> 00:37:02,190
and what these scripting languages help

623
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:05,490
you control on that

624
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:09,820
it's very important that with them

625
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:12,759
programming languages because we are

626
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:16,290
having more and more data and machine

627
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,290
learning Bottari

628
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:24,390
that will become increasingly important

629
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:30,880
also very important

630
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:34,868
learn the language of the business and

631
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:39,820
that with all the companies where I

632
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:42,220
worked sometimes we are just technicians

633
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,950
we'd like to play around and we'd like

634
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:47,140
to kind of speak in our own language and

635
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:51,118
language that we have kind of developed

636
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:54,879
ourselves but this is what cliff Stoll

637
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,790
said in the event he took part last year

638
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,190
and he said when I discovered this

639
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:03,220
mismatch in the accounting or the

640
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:05,980
berkeley university i contacted the FBI

641
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,589
and i told them that i have found these

642
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,540
account and then as i said i told the

643
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:13,180
FBI we have a hacker

644
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,770
we have a person who is logging from

645
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,410
somewhere in the world we have to trace

646
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:20,470
this person and then the FBI asked how

647
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:24,640
much did he steal and they he answered

648
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:27,490
seventy cents okay and we I laughed at

649
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,740
him and I said well by the time these

650
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:34,180
person has it stolen a significant

651
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:36,609
amount of money come back to us and that

652
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:39,700
gave him food for thought and he said

653
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:43,660
well it's actually important is to know

654
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:46,759
how to tell the story so so that that

655
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:50,640
story is compelling

656
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:54,630
but behind that is history and this is

657
00:38:50,640 --> 00:39:01,049
what actually it's important to us these

658
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:03,480
are some newspaper articles some

659
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,390
secondary sentence is person with a

660
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:11,599
great influence nowadays he is the

661
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:14,400
director of research lab in telefónica

662
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:19,250
he is here in Malaga we went to

663
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:25,050
university together person who helped me

664
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:27,750
get to join g2 security and as I say we

665
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:30,119
are talking about language then at that

666
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,670
time we wanted to sell penetration

667
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:39,330
testing many people did not understand

668
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:44,070
why penetration testing was needed so at

669
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:46,170
that time 20 2000 2001 ok people do not

670
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,940
understand the importance of it although

671
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:51,470
some companies were doing that actively

672
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,940
I could be interested but who else

673
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:58,319
should be interested in it as well

674
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:00,420
so very important marketing has to sell

675
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,890
more you may say no no I'm a technical

676
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:04,080
person but even if you are not

677
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:07,140
interested in marketing or selling if

678
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:10,410
you don't own a company we all we are

679
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:13,589
our own brand and we will be carrying

680
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:19,529
our own brand forever one of the things

681
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:22,350
that we sometimes miss is to make all

682
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:27,630
the talented

683
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:31,860
is available in Malaga known there there

684
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:35,880
are very good highly talented people out

685
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:40,650
there either in Malaga or also crosses

686
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:44,420
paints and this is the story I'd like to

687
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:49,260
tell because back in 2001 I remember

688
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:54,990
after spending many months trying to

689
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:57,570
sell her services from Malaga there were

690
00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:00,649
no big companies that wanted to buy us

691
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:03,780
security services we went to Madrid to

692
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,820
Barcelona to get ourselves hired and one

693
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,670
day a big public administration in this

694
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:11,520
country called me they said his mail we

695
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,530
need your services we want to hire you

696
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,890
because were being attacked by the

697
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,980
Chinese government he can imagine it was

698
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:22,200
virtually my first professional job

699
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:25,140
after creating my company we had the

700
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:29,310
coolest webpage brochures in book they

701
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:32,700
call us they tell us this and I said wow

702
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:34,700
it gave my first and last job because I

703
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:40,290
thought

704
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:44,220
it was way out of my league back then so

705
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:46,710
we meant in three days we needed to send

706
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,620
a report explained and what we had

707
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:52,220
uncovered so we spent the whole weekend

708
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:54,900
without slipping scanning those networks

709
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,270
trying to discover what this attackers

710
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:06,290
had discovered in that Network how they

711
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:10,650
got in and I after scanning and

712
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,370
analyzing I found a machine that had

713
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,660
seen before

714
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,790
it wasn't connect all the time at the

715
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:22,560
top or particular point it was connected

716
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:24,410
it was DM said and I find a similar page

717
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,400
similar to this way not exactly this one

718
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:29,580
there's nothing to do with a

719
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,360
particularly government hacking it was

720
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,520
the warm cool Code Red

721
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,410
back then it has interesting story I

722
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:44,970
have don't have enough time to explain

723
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:49,049
it was Chinese military plane taken down

724
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:50,850
by the American government that didn't

725
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:54,480
have this type of regulations the

726
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:57,600
Chinese government retaliated critically

727
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,180
swarm the infected Solaris machines that

728
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,810
scanned and infected machines in the

729
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,509
Internet

730
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:06,390
and left behind this message hacked by

731
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,800
Chinese it was a worm that took

732
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:09,960
advantage of a vulnerability in the

733
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,059
Internet information service service and

734
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:16,269
left this message

735
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:18,969
something that seemed impossible back

736
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:26,198
then it wasn't that complex but it

737
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:28,089
required patience we needed to know what

738
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:30,789
was going on in the world back then and

739
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:32,679
one of these things was this work and

740
00:43:30,789 --> 00:43:34,599
one of the things I learned back then it

741
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:38,890
was helped me a lot to understand about

742
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:41,289
business I had the opportunity to try to

743
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:46,049
do the penetration test the audit the

744
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:50,549
advising but at the end of the day

745
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:54,159
hacking attacking red teaming is useless

746
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:57,459
if you do not improve the company the

747
00:43:54,159 --> 00:44:02,229
security of the company the blue teaming

748
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:04,989
these terms are used used in the

749
00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:07,569
military world of us red team attacks

750
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:09,189
blue team defense one of the things I

751
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:13,929
learn I've learned over the years you

752
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:15,578
don't need to be red blue now people say

753
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:18,449
purple diamond which is the combination

754
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:20,709
of these two colors what does it mean

755
00:44:18,449 --> 00:44:22,630
the important thing here is not been

756
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:24,969
good at attacking or defending the

757
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:27,069
important thing is what do you get with

758
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:30,369
this how do you improve your company's

759
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:33,189
security that's what matters to people

760
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:37,359
that's paying that's maintaining the

761
00:44:33,189 --> 00:44:41,078
business I've had the opportunity to

762
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:44,439
work to hospital group in the city of

763
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:45,999
New York with many public hospitals the

764
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:48,368
positive thing is that you don't get to

765
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:52,390
do your pen testing and you're the

766
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:55,390
dominium in astray administration or the

767
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:57,220
carried our wonderful analysis

768
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:59,520
what's the important thing here the

769
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:02,859
boarding for the hospital network is

770
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,740
providing hospital emergency services to

771
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:09,400
the citizens and your work is supporting

772
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:11,470
that in a way that you can protect the

773
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,560
network and minimize the impact that any

774
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:17,080
attack could have and those services

775
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,600
that the organization is providing so

776
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,400
besides thinking as a hacker you need to

777
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,020
think about what's important for the

778
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,820
organization that's hiring you that's

779
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,570
paying you and that requires your

780
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,600
services

781
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:32,170
this is risk management about your

782
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:35,170
personal brand as I've said before it's

783
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:38,680
going with you wherever you go to be

784
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:42,370
careful one uses the media at some point

785
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,990
we wanted to hire a technical person

786
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:45,880
they were very very good the

787
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:49,330
organization took a look at their social

788
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:52,570
media and they so it had polemic

789
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:55,750
comments and I could even say something

790
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:57,700
else so that's why the reason why the

791
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:59,110
organization said we don't want to hire

792
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,060
this person although from a technical

793
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:03,070
point of view he or she was very good

794
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,290
and these things can stay the social

795
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:10,150
media for many years who take care of

796
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:12,850
your brand share these things indeed hub

797
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:15,880
so that people can see that when you

798
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:18,130
send your CV somewhere people are going

799
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,320
to google your name they're going to see

800
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:23,260
what your published doesn't need to be a

801
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:26,380
very important lecture could it could be

802
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:28,900
just small code but I could say okay

803
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:32,380
this guy knows Sabbath parish about

804
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:34,450
PowerShell about Python he has an

805
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,460
attitude of learning of sharing

806
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:39,399
collaborating people look for this kind

807
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:43,390
of things and this takes me to the next

808
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:47,130
hack right share collaborate

809
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:51,640
we started to do this very long time ago

810
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:55,150
jeetu when the first thing was said was

811
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:57,000
let's create a newsletter about security

812
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:59,830
we want people to know about security

813
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,370
but there was something else we wanted

814
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:06,460
to learn ourselves why because when you

815
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:10,450
write about something what happens it

816
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:13,570
forces you to it makes you think to make

817
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:16,180
you analyze how you're going to explain

818
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:18,610
it how I how you're going to explain a

819
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:21,069
complex thing such as this one to a

820
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:25,540
non-technical audience your parents your

821
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:28,000
brother you have to use examples you

822
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:32,230
have to summarize a problem and that

823
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,290
makes you understand it better and when

824
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:37,120
you have to put it into practice you're

825
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,130
going to have more knowledge so start

826
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,259
your own blog even if at the beginning

827
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:44,590
you don't have readers do it for

828
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:46,030
yourself to start analyzing this type of

829
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:48,760
things write about things you want to

830
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:51,550
learn about three years ago we started

831
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:55,780
to do this set here data centers these

832
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:59,400
states back from 2000 m to Wayback

833
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:02,380
Machine in the internet you can find web

834
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:07,180
pages from many many years ago they're

835
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:08,950
not online anymore it was sort of but in

836
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:13,118
the internet it takes pictures of these

837
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:18,669
pages and stores them

838
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:21,430
and this mended another front of mind we

839
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:24,220
started together in GD security many

840
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:28,419
years ago and he wrote articles about

841
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:33,779
these things even before starting with

842
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:37,569
us he was present in the Internet hug

843
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:40,809
puma people wrote papers he could

844
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:44,499
collaborate this was the original

845
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:46,420
purpose of hackers learning

846
00:48:44,499 --> 00:48:48,189
collaborating teaching others and many

847
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:52,410
of these things were published in the

848
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:54,519
paper in a magazine called roba and

849
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:56,109
manuals that were published for many

850
00:48:54,519 --> 00:49:00,758
years I know what you're thinking many

851
00:48:56,109 --> 00:49:02,920
of you think I have nothing

852
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:05,710
people could care about there are people

853
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:08,499
who are far better than I am that's

854
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:11,980
called the impostor syndrome and we all

855
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:12,999
have it I have it I had it before coming

856
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,680
up to the stage today

857
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:17,308
I thought perhaps what I'm going to

858
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,799
explain is not that interesting we all

859
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:23,440
feel this we think we are here this is

860
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:27,549
what I know and this is what I think

861
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:31,269
others know this is your perception but

862
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:33,970
well it is more like this each one of us

863
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:36,729
has a different experience we can tell

864
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:40,118
something different so don't be afraid

865
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:41,890
put it out there share it and want to

866
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:45,069
share it you'll see that people come to

867
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:48,109
you and ask you and say how oh this is

868
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:52,460
very important the interesting

869
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:54,170
after working in different countries in

870
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:58,190
the Middle East I went to New York I

871
00:49:54,170 --> 00:50:02,480
needed this work as a consultant it's AC

872
00:49:58,190 --> 00:50:04,040
you go to give your consulting results

873
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,780
and you leave the problem into those

874
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:11,120
working that but I had to do this like

875
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:17,930
the client I had to manage a network of

876
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:19,910
more than 60,000 IT devices and I needed

877
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:23,060
tools to carry our emotional our

878
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:26,120
analysis of the machines based on the

879
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:30,320
problems I had back then I created a

880
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:33,140
small problem - I've uploaded - did have

881
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:35,420
I asked my boss do you think I should

882
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,740
share this yes my is this part of our

883
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,230
philosophy we need to share this with

884
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:41,299
people because no one invents anything

885
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:44,030
from scratch if you've done something

886
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:46,970
you learned from someone he inspired we

887
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:49,040
always fight with someone I shed in the

888
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:51,230
internet and I received email from all

889
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,150
around the world people saying that they

890
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,830
were using it it was interesting they

891
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,070
could be improved have you thought about

892
00:50:54,830 --> 00:51:00,590
them doing this or that and one day I

893
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:04,850
was called to give a lecture in sons in

894
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:10,490
a summit in New Orleans I was called a

895
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:15,170
black hat I presented this two years in

896
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:17,000
black hat 2016-2018 my project which

897
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:19,970
honestly when I created it was nothing

898
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,060
it took me two days but people thought

899
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:26,020
it was useful many of the things you may

900
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:28,279
do today perhaps you don't think it's

901
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,470
important it was a little script that

902
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,870
solves a very little problem share it

903
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:34,189
and put your name there because that

904
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:36,770
same problem probably there's another

905
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:40,970
person facing it in France in Brazil

906
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:43,340
Argentina India Australia and once you

907
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:45,350
share it people will see it

908
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:48,920
and they can give you the opportunity to

909
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:51,080
do other interesting things so start to

910
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,430
do that right now yeah

911
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,770
cyber camp you have a very good

912
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:58,960
opportunity to start sharing to people

913
00:51:54,770 --> 00:52:01,780
around you and present your projects so

914
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:08,150
very briefly do you speak English

915
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:11,030
good English here in our cities in Spain

916
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:15,020
when we have to state our level we say

917
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:19,730
ok medium high but we've had the

918
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:22,040
opportunity to hire people here in Spain

919
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:23,810
working from home with very good

920
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:25,460
salaries and we couldn't because they

921
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:28,520
could read English they understood

922
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:30,860
English they they couldn't speak over

923
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,570
the phone they were not fluent enough as

924
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,330
simple as that and it's a better than

925
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:39,260
you invest so much in your studies in

926
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:41,900
learning and due to something as simple

927
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:45,800
as this because it's not that

928
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:48,350
complicated you cannot get a job these

929
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,860
are some suggestions it's not

930
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,860
complicated

931
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:58,150
and last but not least some which is

932
00:52:54,970 --> 00:53:00,160
part of hug philosophy is thinking in

933
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:04,120
graphs not lists for those of you who

934
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:06,850
are stealing as T attackers think in

935
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,430
terms of graphs if this technique is not

936
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:12,339
working I use I try this other one or it

937
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:15,279
is other one and I keep on trying

938
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:19,299
as defenders would beaten by the

939
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:22,839
attackers because we think in lists in

940
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:24,700
terms of lists if I see a I did BC but

941
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:26,288
what happens if you see X and you don't

942
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:30,098
have a handbook that tells you what to

943
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:32,140
do things in graphs so the important

944
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:33,880
thing is not what I've just told you

945
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:36,339
about what you have to do I'm not going

946
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:40,650
to tell you what you have to do the

947
00:53:36,339 --> 00:53:43,660
practical side of this is try it share

948
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:45,190
do things some of these things website

949
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,808
but the important thing is looking for

950
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,180
your own path it's not about having a

951
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:51,729
role a degree the important thing is

952
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:53,710
what do you do during the process the

953
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:59,529
people who will work with you will learn

954
00:53:53,710 --> 00:54:02,349
from what you can offer to other people

955
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:04,809
all the people who offer you no one gets

956
00:54:02,349 --> 00:54:06,729
anything by himself herself don't be

957
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:10,440
afraid of failing that's part of

958
00:54:06,729 --> 00:54:13,319
learning process and that will help you

959
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,509
last but not least find your balance

960
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:17,950
this is like the universe our world is

961
00:54:16,509 --> 00:54:21,239
like the universe it's infinite and

962
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:25,239
expanding we will never finish it

963
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:28,239
some people get depressed there have

964
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:30,609
been cases of suicide because you can

965
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:34,170
easily get lost even if you work from

966
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:36,700
home you can lose your balance and

967
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:39,369
devote every single second of your life

968
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:42,218
to this and that's not good you need you

969
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:46,229
need a balance that's something I've

970
00:54:42,219 --> 00:54:49,569
learned throughout the years my wife has

971
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:51,669
taught me to balance things that will

972
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:53,349
turn you into a better professional to

973
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,779
you'll be a better person a better

974
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:59,309
professional you'll be more successful

975
00:54:55,779 --> 00:54:59,309
in your job

976

00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:21,799
been able to learn all the basic things

983
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:23,859
