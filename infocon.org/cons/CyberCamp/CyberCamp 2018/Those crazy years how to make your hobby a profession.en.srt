2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:16,689
today my presentation is said will be a

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,970
bit difficult I'm very much they're used

4
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:29,980
to giving highly technical presentations

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:35,019
however today we well we will be moving

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,460
away from technical matter today we will

7
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:39,220
be talking about and playability

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,870
employability so to speak and therefore

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:47,769
I have taken on the challenge or telling

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:53,010
what is true what is it like to work in

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:57,969
this field how we can embark in this

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:02,559
profession and then move along so my

13
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:13,740
presentation is about how to make how to

14
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:18,610
turn your hobby into your job before I

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,699

16
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:25,270
warning with you okay and this is my

17

only want I just don't want to give any

19
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,830
lectures I just want to share my

20
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:38,679
trajectory with you I only want to share

21

my story with you as I say I only want

22
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:48,250

23
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:50,140

you to make of your talent which is a

27
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:05,410
trendy word to make up your talents as I

28
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,780
say your best ally so my presentation

29
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,899
will be divided in several sections I

30
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,500
will I start talking about hobby so you

31
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,720
are all here because you

32
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,320
started into here because this was your

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:25,520
hobby you were not you have not been

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:30,170
working in it since the beginning you

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,810
are all here because you had that

36
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,619
[Music]

37
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:40,130
incentive of security means inside

38
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,370
because breaking security is better fun

39
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:47,239
that breaking pane of glass is English

40
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:51,470
however there are people also have a

41
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:54,110
good time in defending security later on

42
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,170
move on to talk about training do we

43
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,989
need training actual training what type

44
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:03,559
of training do we have to go to

45
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:06,950
university to get an education and well

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,110
that is so so that also could be debated

47
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,310
and then how to get your first job I

48
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:18,549
have very many jobs before I finished up

49
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:22,250
in the world of security and as well

50
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:24,970
despite this being a hobby for very very

51
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:28,930
many years but it also requires

52
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:33,820
significant effort and then lives those

53
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:37,790
great crazy yes because security

54
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:41,359
security is booming so if you like it if

55
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:45,410
it is your hobby that is like you will

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,920
be even better so everything has to

57
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:52,310
start ok we all have to be very clear

58
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:55,670
about the moment when we start liking it

59
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:58,280
ok that you may be 3 years old 70 or so

60
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,679
on 20 years old but there will come a

61
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,140
time that you know for sure that you are

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,880
so excited about it that you love it and

63
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:10,850
I realized that when I was 3 years old

64
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:14,250
so have you seen this device before have

65
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:17,940
you seen this equipment before well not

66
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:21,510
you are of a young age okay some of you

67
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,180
are of my same age okay I do have seen

68
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:28,500
this before or actually rings a bell to

69
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,710
you on the screen it says 1985 well

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:37,350
actually back in 1985 I was not even

71
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:40,320
born okay I was born in 1986 so when I

72
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,260
was 3 years old we had this device at

73
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,770
home my I have an elder brother he is 10

74
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,789
years older and he got a computer as

75
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:54,570
presents and he chose these equipment

76
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,490
and then my mother used to tell him off

77
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,640
a ketoses head don't let your little

78
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,880
brother use the computer because he will

79
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,340
break it and well because computers are

80
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,409
said were extremely expensive that was

81
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,250
28 years ago and that continue to

82
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:14,760
remember is and my elder brother used to

83
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:18,169
answer to my mother look I let him using

84
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:22,260
it because he can't use it better than

85
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:24,479
myself and actually he was just showing

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,969
me what to do and I used to repeat and

87
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,460
to follow everything he was teaching me

88
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,620
I remember I was three years old and

89
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,599
then I continued to use the computer

90
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,380
over and over again and I used to use

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,410
the computer to play games well you may

92
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,780
remember games such as these ones okay

93
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,210
we used to spend hours and hours in and

94
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,489
play in this game this was a game of

95
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,650
Emilio butragueño I don't know whether

96
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,590
you remember it or not and you could

97
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,750
play the same game over and over again

98
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:56,400
there were no different teams early two

99
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,080
teams okay butragueño

100
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,380
was leading or was playing in the white

101
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,210
team

102
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,360
okay then we also have the fernando

103
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:11,370
martine game

104
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,760
I'm Jesus worthy games notice okay take

105
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,040
a look

106
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:24,200
[Music]

107
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:28,140
well alarming speed okay and that was it

108
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:31,409
okay was it scoring a goal and that was

109
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:35,789
our FISA at a time I spent hours playing

110
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:39,510
in that game three years old for

111
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:47,060
yourself five years old and well these

112
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:50,610
was what followed then a few years later

113
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:57,350
we had the first Pentium at home Pentium

114
00:06:50,610 --> 00:07:00,000
2 266 megahertz for gigabytes hard drive

115
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,890
actually we only used to during the

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,770
lifecycle of the computer that would

117
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:06,479
tell you why and a 64 megabytes from at

118
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,870
this point of time we are talking 16

119
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:16,230
gigabyte ram memory for a home computer

120
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:18,600
and that was the top edge or top

121
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,900
computer at the time and why do we use

122
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,090
that we used like two real gigabytes

123
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,760
actually the hard drive had 4 gigabytes

124
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,729
but I didn't have enough knowledge at

125
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:35,010
that time I was 11 or 12 years old and I

126
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:39,060
didn't have good enough knowledge for

127
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:42,360
many yes we were used only to real

128
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,700
gigabytes because it was partitioned and

129
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,830
then even though the seller told us that

130
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,380
he had like 4 gigabyte hard drive and

131
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,490
would you would look for the other two

132
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,860
additional ones and you couldn't find

133
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,230
them and then other time I started to

134
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,440
read magazines and they were talking

135
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,410
about partitioning the hard drives are

136
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,480
tools that you could do

137
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,850
so the famous fdisk that everyone is

138
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,640
aware of now and when I was 12 years old

139
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,560
and then about it in a magazine and then

140
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,840
a dance about it and actually I created

141
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,630
a second partition and I said well I've

142
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,690
just doubled the capacity of the hard

143
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,820
drive and to me it was a big achievement

144
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,219
and as I said because for a long time I

145
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,800
suffered because I could only use two

146
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,710
gigabytes where the my father had bought

147
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:35,990
me a four gigabytes a computer and then

148
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:40,250
a year later I well got to know the

149
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:42,200
Internet that was my second love in life

150
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,870
I fell in love with it at that time

151
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:50,300
there was no there were no routers on me

152
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:53,350
a modem to log on to the Internet and

153
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:57,699
the modem gave you the public IP address

154
00:08:53,350 --> 00:09:00,980
nowadays we all know that well router

155
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,480
creates a private network you go into

156
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,280
the Internet through the private address

157
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,710
of the router but there is better

158
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,420
security better protection behind that

159
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,130
but at the time was interesting from the

160
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,610
offensive viewpoints because each

161
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,830
machine you connected to a modem was

162
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,860
right away connected to the Internet so

163
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,620
there was no router so from the view

164
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:26,240
point of view of as a viewpoint that was

165
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:33,970
quite interesting then as I say the

166
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:38,330
internet arrived and okay I'll play how

167
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:45,130
one the sounds okay flood rate from 6

168
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:48,040
p.m. until 8 a.m. and sometimes the line

169
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:52,880
was disconnected

170
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,880
[Music]

171
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:05,330
do you remember well I used to put

172
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:10,209
clothes clothes on top of modem because

173
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:12,860
I didn't want to hear that noise or

174
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,350
anymore and I didn't want my parents to

175
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,970
know that I was logging the Internet in

176
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:22,660
the middle of the nights okay

177
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:25,760
it was 2856 a cake and when the

178
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:29,569
connection went down and went down so

179
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,370
when you just go to telephone okay got a

180
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,200
phone call what happened that the line

181
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,600
was disconnected and I used to tell my

182
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,480
mom do not take any call to not get any

183
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:45,710
calls okay so well that was a different

184
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:48,560
time and anyway we learned over time so

185
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:55,460
the internet came home when I was but at

186
00:10:48,560 --> 00:11:00,130
the end of 2000 and then I started to

187
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:08,900
get curious about security hacking and

188
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:13,360
then I started to visit websites so it

189
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:18,350
was controversial website for cracks

190
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,330
what tracks were programs that were

191
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,460
replacing the original binary of a

192
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:25,940
program with the objective of cracking

193
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,980
down protection and well that website

194
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,920
offers significant wealth of information

195
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:34,040
about how many things worked it was not

196
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,829
only about cracking I never did any

197
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,449
cracking well what do you expect me to

198
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:43,130
sell you but anyway there were very many

199
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:45,560
tutorials there and where there weren't

200
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,700
very many held a website suffering this

201
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,010
type of tutorials at a time we also had

202
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,920
this type of websites notice we have

203
00:11:52,010 --> 00:12:01,310
recovered them thanks to archive dot o

204
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:05,660
RG that stores a copy since 1999 so

205
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:08,449
these have hacker cracker websites so

206
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,910
this is very old he's back Patties he

207
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:15,020
started a long time ago we are talking

208
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:17,780
about 2002 these were magazines about

209
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,180
hacking of a hacking techniques and

210
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,100
sometimes it was hard to find this type

211
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:27,040
of information whereas nowadays this

212
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:32,740
type of information is at the tip of our

213
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:37,550
take away and then well at that time we

214
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:43,850
we learned from these type of websites

215
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:47,170
and then as I said I also started to get

216
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,910
curious about well playing playing

217
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,890
around with all this okay there was a

218
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,890
group of us could used to get together

219
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:57,770
at high school and we used to play

220
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:00,230
around with this type of thing net bass

221
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:03,290
have you heard this does it ring a bell

222
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:05,900
to you well only few people I thought

223
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,750
that most of you were going to raise

224
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:13,130
your hands this was a trillion it came

225
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:17,510
out before Google it was invented before

226
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:21,650
a google google came after it with this

227
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:25,880
try and with this program you could gain

228
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:29,000
remote control of device it was not a

229
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,100
reverse trajectory was a direct one as I

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,010
say you log onto the internet through

231
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:38,120
your model IP

232
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:43,100
public key and that was it and then you

233
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:46,820
just log on to any port in this case 1 2

234
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,670
3 4 5 ok this application D and the lion

235
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,790
side of it was very simple the orders

236
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:57,500
were sent out through TCP they were sent

237
00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:01,780
in plain text like no protocol no

238
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:05,650
nothing so NAT buzz 1.6

239
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:10,089
and as I said you could remotely control

240
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:20,850
the equipment so we used to open this

241
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:20,850
see the ROM have you heard of big walk

242
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:31,630
big walk came out at the same time that

243
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,280
net pass and we also used to try it out

244
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:39,220
in local networks and these

245
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,939
implementation durability that Microsoft

246
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:45,880
heart that is to say shared resources

247
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:49,870
like an SBS rather than shared resources

248
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:54,580
nowadays and pick Bach implemented a

249
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:56,830
vulnerability from the year 2000 so

250
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,410
without knowing the key of the ship

251
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:04,590
resources it allows you to accessing it

252
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:08,079
it was bypassed you didn't know the

253
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:12,750
password of the search results but it

254
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:16,900
implemented vulnerability well the

255
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:19,330
continues to be a public key that you

256
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,250
can use if you so wish and to me that

257
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:24,730
was done magic I press this button

258
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:26,860
insert the resource and then this is

259
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,310
magic and at the time I didn't mind what

260
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:33,400
happened one was underlying that because

261
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,949
I was 14 years old and then over time I

262
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:41,260
started to get an interest in what this

263
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:45,070
application was doing in the background

264
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:47,490
so nooks have you heard of them have you

265
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,490
tried them

266
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:57,779
so this is type of nuke this is another

267
00:15:50,619 --> 00:16:03,129
type of nuke so we were just using them

268
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:05,439
between us to bother each other so they

269
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:07,600
implemented the nail of attack the

270
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:13,779
denial of access attacks and they were

271
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:16,149
just bothering each other so one single

272
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:19,899
- one single person with this program

273
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:25,679
could just prevent you from stopping you

274
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:30,730
from logging the Internet what else I

275
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:33,488
was also curious about information

276
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:38,230
accessing information and we just work

277
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:42,399
on these with IRC through iron RERC this

278
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:44,110
is much better known so you we could use

279
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,610
several channels to access this

280
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:51,629
information and this one this is an old

281
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:55,209
friend I spent long hours message

282
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:58,839
messenger well many people nowadays are

283
00:16:55,209 --> 00:17:01,779
using facebook Messenger and this makes

284
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:04,209
me feel older even though I'm not old

285
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,409
the original Messenger is the messenger

286
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,409
of Microsoft

287
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,930
- do you remember all that buzzing that

288
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,810
you gosh

289
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:19,579
in the original messenger but messenger

290
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:23,990
allowed us to communicate with each

291
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:28,190
other and also to testing can you

292
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:33,350
remember what you could do with 186 3

293
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:35,690
port from messenger well nowadays that

294
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:38,149
part is used for different reason for

295
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:41,210
different purposes but at that time when

296
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,520
we were messaging each other through

297
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,500
messengers messages went through

298
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,830
Microsoft unless you wanted to send out

299
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,240
a file and then at that time and the

300
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,669
communication between your machine and

301
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,670
the mashing of the other person used to

302
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:59,360
be open so therefore we were connecting

303
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:01,970
through an I'm public IP address so if

304
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,179
you sends out a file to a friend you

305
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:08,480
could easily know or get to know his IP

306
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:12,580
public address and many people do start

307
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:16,250
to send trillions right away because

308
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:19,540
because as it went through a messenger

309
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:22,280
it was not detected and then the person

310
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,820
planted the trillions and because the

311
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,399
communication was point to points okay

312
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:33,350
then they knew the IP address they need

313
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,630
to log into to send a trillion and quite

314
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:40,719
a significant number of people did that

315
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,720
because it was quite simple thing to do

316
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:50,960
this was a basic case and once we were

317
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:54,680
playing around with E well with group of

318
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,300
friends and then well at that time at

319
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,760
the time what we were doing was quite

320
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:02,169
advanced okay even though today is very

321
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,170
basic simple thing

322
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:13,149
and then in this search to find out what

323
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:16,639
I was what was really exciting to me

324
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:18,998
then I started to get an interesting

325
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:22,339
hacking okay without bothering anyone

326
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:28,190
without breaching the law and then I

327
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:31,989
started to read that time kevin Mitnick

328
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:36,109
was very popular have you heard of him

329
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:38,119
well at that time kevin Mitnick will

330
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:43,908
became a reference to me

331
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:50,289
she was not an exploiter he was probably

332
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:55,339
the best social engineer of history and

333
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:57,259
over time I was lucky enough to meet him

334
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:59,329
and to spend something with him okay he

335
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:01,909
is right in the middle well on the right

336
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:07,009
we have Timah and then when I mean on

337
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:08,479
the left I was very lucky to meet him

338
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:13,700
and as I said to spend a few days with

339
00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:17,809
him we also have all the references and

340
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:21,169
not all of them are other engaged okay

341
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:25,759
so I don't hurt who unfortunately passed

342
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:27,259
away and she's a reference to many of us

343
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,950
because when he was fourteen years old

344
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:34,879
he specified RSS and he helped in the

345
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:38,929
design of Creative Commons license

346
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:43,129
he was a brilliant person and well he

347
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:46,059
sent was unfortunate and his Brazil was

348
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:49,309
very influential

349
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:55,209
he was very inspirational since the age

350
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:55,209
of 13 up until he died and

351
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:02,010
very very interesting person and then

352
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:07,440
another person who was a great reference

353
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:09,600
to me was a Steve Wozniak other because

354
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,590
of his technical side which was

355
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,590
brilliant

356
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:23,580
Wozniak was kind of when the technical

357
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:26,520
side and in the work that he did with

358
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:33,570
the Steve Jobs when they produced the

359
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:35,520
first Apple prototype Steve Jobs was

360
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,370
clear that I wanted to set up a company

361
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,570
and then posniak said I work for HP and

362
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,560
the first thing that I have to do to

363
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:46,050
deliver this to HP because I learned all

364
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:50,879
these from HP and this is what helped me

365
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:54,780
produce what I produced and then he gave

366
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,080
that out to HP and HP was wrong and said

367
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,899
no no the future is not in computer ok

368
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,470
and when he caught this answer he became

369
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,930
free to do whatever he wanted to do he

370
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,600
could have decided not to share that

371
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:14,250
with HP but he decided to do it because

372
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,350
he had that value all right so when you

373
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,380
have a hobby how can you turn your hobby

374
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:21,490
into your job okay you can do that

375
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,060
through training

376
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,370
[Music]

377
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:30,990
well in these rels training and learning

378
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:37,370
has gone through self teaching most of

379
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:41,160
the time so often we are self-taught

380
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:44,370
people so you will be all the time

381
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:49,380
testing things reading out learning from

382
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:51,659
others definition of a self-taught

383
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,230
people is a person who learns everything

384
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:57,720
by himself but it is not only that okay

385
00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:02,400
we cannot learn it out by ourselves we

386
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:06,870
need help we need help from books from

387
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:10,650
literature from blogs from labs have

388
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:14,219
some importance when I teach a

389
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:17,310
university I always tell my students

390
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:20,070
that is very good that I share with them

391
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:23,220
how I do things but at the end of the

392
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:25,620
day we need them to try things out by

393
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:30,060
themselves I cannot really tell you what

394
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:32,790
sequel injection is unless you do it you

395
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,090
try it out by yourself you do it and you

396
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:39,720
internalize it nowadays we also have

397
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:43,919
labs only in the internet there are very

398
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,740
many sites where we have what we can

399
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,170
embark on

400
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:54,230
environments and challenges we also have

401
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:59,520
the opportunity to use videos and also

402
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:09,140
to use communities to share knowledge

403
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:13,280
and then university I went to university

404
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:15,920
when I went to university I cannot stop

405
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:20,129
hacking then I went to university

406
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:25,920
focused on something other things such

407
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:29,010
as partying this kind of thing so can we

408
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:33,960
say that University is decisive to go

409
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:36,180
into security world no not really not

410
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,310
really easy it's not essential but

411
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,930
University will give you basic tools

412
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:48,179
fundamental tools that will allow you to

413
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:53,600
depend your knowledge and then to get

414
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:53,600
any job related to IT

415
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:04,260
many people say I'm studying vocational

416
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:09,430
training well no problem yes you can

417
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:12,520
enter the security sector if you do

418
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:17,860
vocational training you don't need to go

419
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:20,889
to university and actually I know cases

420
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:23,889
of people who didn't do didn't go to

421
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:26,050
university didn't do any vocational

422
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:29,860
training and actually a friend of mine

423
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:32,320
was kind of kicked out from vocational

424
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,810
training and now I say he's working in

425
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,730
the world of security he's making a good

426
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:40,750
living out of it he has worked in

427
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:43,720
several companies dozen company degrees

428
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:46,380
or any diplomas so that is to say

429
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,050
different ways to get to the same point

430
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,120
University kind of makes it easier a bit

431
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,899
easier for us for everything that we get

432
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,969
out of university you don't get a full

433
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,800
knowledge from University when you

434
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,740
graduate from University you cannot feel

435
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:08,830
that you are master back no anniversa to

436
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:12,700
give as many things any type of profile

437
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:15,629
can access that you don't need and

438
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:19,600
university degree together and it's

439
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:23,170
specialization you have to constantly

440
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,159
recycle yourself this job changes every

441
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,310
day

442
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,680
I remember a friend of mine bike in

443
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:34,550
University and I treated this person

444
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:36,980
just in case his listening and he's to

445
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:43,690
say well they want to finish his degree

446
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:48,050
in order to stop studying it was some

447
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:51,860
circuit or overflow in my head because

448
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:55,250
our industry technology industry changes

449
00:26:51,860 --> 00:27:00,459
every day if you don't keep yourself

450
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:06,200
updated you're going to stay behind and

451
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:09,530
cyber security world goes even beyond IT

452
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,990
in this in a sense you need to recycle

453
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:14,480
yourself at the time private training

454
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:17,510
well this is another option it's there

455
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,780
there's a market in order to continue to

456
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:22,430
recycle yourself and of course self

457
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,070
teaching yourself no one's going to

458
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,260
teach you everything some things you'll

459
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:29,960
have to learn them yourselves you need

460
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:34,190
to train there's not a recipe it's not

461
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:37,550
like you go somewhere and you finish

462
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:41,480
being you end up being an expert you

463
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:43,790
need to study yourself there are people

464
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,900
who can help me with master's degree

465
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:49,899
training courses etc but you need to

466
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:54,070
supplement

467
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,690
that and their certifications that this

468
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,610
is sort of a taboo but we need to speak

469
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,630
about this some people ask is it

470
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:06,719
necessary do I need this certificate I'm

471
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:15,460
not going to give any names well no I

472
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:17,200
mean I prefer that company hiring you

473
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,960
should give you the certifications if

474
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,040
you join a company with a junior profile

475
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:27,220
and they suggest career path for you

476
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,750
they can give you these certifications

477
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,610
and that's a very good thing because

478
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,470
they're interested in you having that

479
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,350
certificate so they can join some

480
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:38,560
profiles so it's a win-win situation the

481
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:40,780
person wins because he or she is

482
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,000
receiving certifications the company is

483
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,620
happy also because they have good people

484
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,750
in the company they're winning projects

485
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:53,979
and they charge money for those projects

486
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:57,240
I know many cases of people who finish

487
00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:00,220
the degree at university already have

488
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:05,050
certifications in cybersecurity and it's

489
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:08,440
ok something else but it's not pivotal

490
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:10,480
so that a company offers you your first

491
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,760
opportunity is it going to help you yes

492
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,720
but you're going to get to the same

493
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,760
place but that's my opinion you can

494
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,540
argue with that everything is safe it's

495
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,540
arguable

496
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,590
so are they useful yes they useful but I

497
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,200
prefer that the company gives them to

498
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,209
you when you're a young and one-year

499
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,420
ping offer the first opportunity the

500
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:38,120
supplements of course they're

501
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:41,230
specialized and which ones are

502
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,300
interesting for me there are many other

503
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:47,900
but personally I prefer certificate

504
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:50,090
certifications that assess your actual

505
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,800
ability whether you've requires the

506
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:58,010
ability how do you do that

507
00:29:51,800 --> 00:30:02,540
with a test if I give you an examination

508
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:05,240
to check that you have the skills it's

509
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:08,330
weird you have some knowledge perhaps

510
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:11,510
you're you've read a test in the

511
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:14,570
internet which was quite similar perhaps

512
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:17,360
it's more interesting that we are

513
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:20,210
assessed by giving us some time in the

514
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,000
series of exercises and I'm being

515
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:25,250
assessed like that I have the skills to

516
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,190
solve these problems there are these

517
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:34,300
types of certifications so now let's

518
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:37,940
move on to a chapter 3 my first job

519
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:42,649
first of all I'd like to tell you about

520
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:47,680
my story I had a serious first jobs the

521
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:52,250
first one I show it with a sandwich I

522
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:55,200
used to sell sandwiches I prepared them

523
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:57,539
and so with him I did that when I was 17

524
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,870
high school I had to stay one year for

525
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:04,889
with two subjects if I could go to

526
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:07,500
college and I used up time to get my

527
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:09,658
driving license and to work I started to

528
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,880
work I need to request my father's

529
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,039
permission because I was a minor he I

530
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,460
gave it to be and I worked over the

531
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,440
weekend

532
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,779
it's like many other people now the

533
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,549
antia start to value lots of things when

534
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:22,860
you do that and when you chief other

535
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:25,019
things you dream of you value them more

536
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,969
because you've gone through this

537
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:30,870
experience it was not just the

538
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:35,700
sandwiches there was noted to buy a car

539
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:39,090
a little car please do not think there

540
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:50,370
was a wonderful car second this looks

541
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:52,439
like a tablet i marketed them in a in a

542
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:57,178
shop which is very famous in order to

543
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,740
get myself a laptop I wanted a laptop

544
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:02,700
and I didn't want to ask my father for

545
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:09,090
the money and in another famous shop

546
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:13,470
I sold many products I was wearing a red

547
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:19,740
jacket are you familiar with that there

548
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:21,690
are some people wearing a red jacket but

549
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,870
it's really flashy and doesn't look very

550
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:28,260
nice but I wore that jacket and it

551
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:32,370
helped me to value effort my goal back

552
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:36,658
then was this so I needed to to work

553
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:38,789
this was these were my first jobs and

554
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:41,130
I'm proud of it then once I like the one

555
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:43,799
I liked more was the sandwiches because

556
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,260
I didn't have time to get bored and I

557
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,340
learned that being bored being still

558
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:50,070
like this

559
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,629
watching time goes time going by it was

560
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,879
not a good thing for me I didn't like it

561
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:57,810
but doing sandwiches all the time

562
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,750
well they liked that I had scholarships

563
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:08,070
and grants at university like Juan

564
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:11,790
Carlos in Madrid then I joined an IT

565
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:16,470
company in the south of Madrid legen s I

566
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:19,020
worked half a month I didn't stay long

567
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:22,200
because of the repression issues and I

568
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:29,160
saw that I was not learning very much so

569
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:31,020
I quit and then I arrived to I 64 I have

570
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,140
a friend called Juan Antonio Caius

571
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:37,650
he sent my CV for me I didn't know about

572
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,900
that they called me they told me you

573
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:43,590
need to come here for an interview so I

574
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,480
went there there was this was 2009 I did

575
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,149
the interview and they said you need to

576
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,310
prepare topic to present it and that

577
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:54,960
that's what to be your second interview

578
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:57,210
I have never presented any topic just my

579
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,760
project at the ends of my university

580
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:03,020
degree we weren't taught to give

581
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,310
presentations so I gave the presentation

582
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:11,340
the way it could and I landed a job I

583
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:14,880
joined in 2009 I stayed there until 2013

584
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:18,690
until telefónica bought the company so

585
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,340
those four years for a professional

586
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:26,100
point of view perhaps they were the best

587
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:29,010
years in my life why because I decided

588
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:32,009
to joan i nessa me but the risk that

589
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:34,380
entails because what here in university

590
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:37,080
you you're like crazy about big

591
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,600
companies and i chose a different path I

592
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,940
don't regret it of course I would take

593
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:44,580
that decision again I decided to join an

594
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,850
SME I could have taken the regular path

595
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:49,799
which is joining a big IT company a

596
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:52,679
consulting company which is ok it's not

597
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,100
a bad way to start but I joined an SME

598
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,270
instead and my friends from university

599
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,650
this to us

600
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:04,440
to me what do you work and I said

601
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:06,690
informatica isn't a Quadro okay Tim

602
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,540
Alonso was not known back then the

603
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:13,490
company was not known it was widely

604
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:17,130
known in cybersecurity industry but

605
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:20,040
people didn't know about it and a woman

606
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:22,740
once asked me what company do you work

607
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,240
for and I would I would say informatica

608
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:28,350
Sunday but I was very proud of it

609
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,669
because I learned a lot there and she

610
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:33,690
said I didn't ask in which Street

611
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:37,250
because the name of the company sounds

612
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,250
like when you give an address in Spanish

613
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:44,150
a year later she knew about informatica

614
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:47,750
isn't a Quadra because it was bought by

615
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:51,530
telephone Iike see that stuck with my

616
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:52,970
with me it was a really strong thing it

617
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:55,430
was a joke

618
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:57,290
and I said okay everybody say the same

619
00:35:55,430 --> 00:36:00,109
thing no one knows about this company

620
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:03,040
but is very happy that I didn't care

621
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:06,319
about the number of hours we would work

622
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,770
we learned a lot we learned from each

623
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:13,790
other it was like a family I've put it

624
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:16,040
here and it's really surprised that a

625
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:18,279
company being like a family and recently

626
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,990
I've become familiar with a similar case

627
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,480
it's a family they have something very

628
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:26,359
similar and it's very beautiful because

629
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,040
knowledge flows no one keeps what they

630
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:30,589
know for themselves and that happens in

631
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,720
some other companies I didn't tell you

632
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:35,299
about what I know because you might get

633
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,919
ahead of myself in an SME it doesn't

634
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,750
happen or it shouldn't happen because

635
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:46,520
this is the survival of the SME is

636
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:50,030
beyond that how do we get our first job

637
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:54,290
it's about skills and when I say skills

638
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't mean that this should be

639
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,730
understood as well I have a master's

640
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,060
degree university degrees it's not that

641
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:05,060
justice how many of you have a degree

642
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:12,759
probably many of you many of you have a

643
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:12,759
degree or a vocational training degree

644
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,890
everybody has something so if you go to

645
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:22,339
human resources and this is a real

646
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:25,069
situation if you go to human resources

647
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:28,460
they're going to tell you I received

648
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:32,060
series which are copy-paste IT engineer

649
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,920
I to engineer IT engineer how do I make

650
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,828
the difference how do I know which one

651
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,980
is the right one for my company it's

652
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:41,599
very complicated and skills are

653
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,359
important for that the skills you need

654
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:48,670
to prove and which are not proven

655
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:48,670
through a degree for example

656
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:54,750
I have something I like like your

657
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:56,760
project and I create a blog and my CV I

658
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,680
can ask the head I have a blog and

659
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,770
probably the people reading my CV will

660
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:06,450
check my blog you may have technical

661
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:08,520
things there o things that you like if

662
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:11,520
you create code on your own if you

663
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,009
create apps you can have a G have a

664
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,839
public G have you can put it in your CV

665
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,109
because that's added value for you

666
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,960
because yes this guy has a degree or

667
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:24,089
vocational training degree but he has d

668
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,390
hub and I can see what he actually does

669
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:29,670
if you go to a conference and you show

670
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:31,259
that you're going to those conference

671
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,410
that you want to learn that's an

672
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,410
attitude

673
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:43,080
of course this effort needs to be shown

674
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,490
somehow and that's very complicated so

675
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,210
with this type of things where you're

676
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:49,680
telling Human Resources people it's easy

677
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,730
for you to have an advantage in that

678
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,279
process it's not mathematics but it can

679
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:59,550
be done you can you need to show your

680
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,890
passion when you show how passionate you

681
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:04,290
are about what you do and the person in

682
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:07,109
front of you sees that they know that

683
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:12,800
your profile is potentially interesting

684
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:15,360
why because your attitude your skills

685
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,010
well you have it with the learning

686
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:20,040
you've received with the things you've

687
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,990
learned and even if you don't have it

688
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,090
the company can provide it for you

689
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,250
somehow otherwise you will leave the

690
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:28,350
company but they will give it to you

691
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,619
especially at the beginning but the

692
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:32,710
attitude

693
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:35,210
that's something the companies should

694
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:37,279
require and they are requiring it

695
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:39,650
because that's not something you learn

696
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:40,219
that's something you have you have it in

697
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:44,539
you

698
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:46,969
so this is the discussion the attitude

699
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:51,680
you have it in you and you have to show

700
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:53,509
it and the skills that's something that

701
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,339
the training that something the

702
00:39:53,509 --> 00:40:04,430
companies can't provide you with this is

703
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:06,619
something you could argue and this also

704
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:13,969
something else you need to show which is

705
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:18,829
being humble cybersecurity and other

706
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:21,759
industries I think any industry life you

707
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:21,759
need to be humble

708
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:30,180
in other industries and in ours there

709
00:40:26,289 --> 00:40:33,339
may be eight egos which is normal but

710
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:35,919
being humble is a value that you can

711
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:43,690
convey and it's always positive if it's

712
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:46,920
real I'll tell your story personal story

713
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:51,490
this is externally award for my degree

714
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:56,529
IT engineer first academic record in

715
00:40:51,490 --> 00:41:00,129
2008 line my university I hope this

716
00:40:56,529 --> 00:41:09,089
story is useful for you back then I was

717
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:12,160
26 no 23 23 24 years old or 22:03 rather

718
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:14,380
there was a ceremony at the university

719
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,049
the people receiving the awards were

720
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,450
there it was so very nice what does your

721
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:24,130
a go do with that when you're 22 what

722
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:30,098
goes up it grows and there you say I'm

723
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:32,380
the best my class that's great the best

724
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:37,480
my class the best I'm the best I'm the

725
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:40,059
best next day I went back to my to work

726
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,270
informatica sent a Quadro nice up there

727
00:41:40,059 --> 00:41:45,579
and took a look as my colleagues this

728
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:47,680
guy doesn't have university degree this

729
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:49,599
one doesn't have a university degree or

730
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,850
additional training degree and they were

731
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:57,740
far better than I was

732
00:41:52,850 --> 00:42:00,560
back then my ego decreased why because

733
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:03,549
at the end of the day you need to have a

734
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,960
clear idea where you are who you are

735
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:08,930
you're not going to be the best one so

736
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:12,130
you have talent y'all have talent and

737
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:15,080
you need to focus that talent we need to

738
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:18,830
understand and have a clear about idea

739
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:21,590
about how things are so that you keep

740
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:24,230
yourself grounded at some point I can I

741
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:25,910
confess that I thought I'm the best but

742
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:28,670
no it was false it was an award

743
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:32,290
recognition I received great with that

744
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:36,350
that's Amin you're the best Chapter four

745
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:38,470
those crazy years getting close to the

746
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,470
end

747
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:50,530
cybersecurity is growing the worst thing

748
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,279
in this life is working something I

749
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,560
didn't like

750
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,510
there was a colleague of mine from

751
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:58,029
Romania a colleague of mine in

752
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:00,040
telefónica I like this sentence because

753
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,640
it's a very simple sentence where it's

754
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,070
real

755
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,279
we spent a high percentage of her life

756
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:09,910
working if we had the opportunity or the

757
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,560
possibility since we're young working at

758
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:14,100
something we like something we're

759
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,100
passionate about

760
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:24,680
that's extraordinary it's a privilege

761
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:27,259
because there are many people who work

762
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,569
every day in many things that they don't

763
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:32,479
like and they have to do it they have

764
00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:34,970
people to feed people to sustain to

765
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:36,609
maintain they have responsibilities we

766
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,680
have a very interesting opportunity

767
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:42,890
which is the privilege is being able to

768
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,319
do what will like and I've had the

769
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:48,049
situation twice because right now we're

770
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:50,299
finished theoretically in crisis but

771
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:52,160
when I started we were in the middle of

772
00:43:50,299 --> 00:43:53,930
the huge crisis and had the opportunity

773
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,509
I have started to work in something I

774
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:59,450
was passionate about at a time in which

775
00:43:56,509 --> 00:44:03,489
people were jobless so I had my

776
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:11,379
privilege was double and then you need

777
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:11,380
to work in your interests

778
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:20,060
in your the things you're curious about

779
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:23,240
there's a spool of teaching tools what

780
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,099
we propose a code in order to start to

781
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,779
learn about cybersecurity if you're not

782
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:29,359
familiar with this I would recommend you

783
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:32,030
to access it it's become some sort of a

784
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,359
wiki there are some things included

785
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:37,369
there sometimes we go there to remember

786
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,000
things it was a community back then now

787
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:44,420
it's a blog with repositories in our

788
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,210
life to send a message for those of you

789
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:50,060
the youngest ones here and that is that

790
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:52,640
in Spain there there's a lot of talent

791
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:56,390
there are a lot of people outside of

792
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,940
Spain working big companies you have

793
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,759
curiosity you're thrilled about it but

794
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:06,320
you need to work on that this passion

795
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,920
and this attitude

796
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,470
[Music]

797
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:14,200
and time I'll give you this examples

798
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:17,200
this association they move a lot the

799
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:21,879
variant people there I'm sort of a

800
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:26,740
quarry for talent they're constantly

801
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:28,630
proving that movement that curiosity for

802
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,540
learning and they're not requesting

803
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:34,420
anything in it in exchange they want to

804
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:37,060
learn the one to absorb that's all they

805
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:40,990
think about who got to have this blog

806
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:43,420
that's just another example people that

807
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:47,410
got together they learn from each other

808
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:50,350
and they grew they've grown so much

809
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:54,220
last year in Bridget Khan they had a

810
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:59,440
whole truck for them that speakers and

811
00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:03,540
everything and then Alisal same thing

812
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,100
very young people still in high school

813
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:10,650
that trained to take part in

814
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:13,330
cybersecurity competitions it's a great

815
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:15,720
human quarry there's a lot of additives

816
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:15,720
there

817
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:23,710
and refinishing I would like to mention

818
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:23,710
entrepreneurship

819
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:30,529
schedule entrepreneurship in this

820
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,290
country something should be improved

821
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:36,490
it's true that legislation itself it's

822
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:39,790
not the best so that anyone can easily

823
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:45,080
start a company we should work in that

824
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:46,009
but the country is made with people that

825
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,860
take risk

826
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:55,360
who'd she think said this you're going

827
00:46:48,860 --> 00:47:04,940
to be surprised were in Malaga right

828
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:07,160
Antonia wonders he was talking to the

829
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,740
founder of uber who spoke about

830
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,830
everything all the times he had failed

831
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:16,250
the debts he had until he succeeded and

832
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:17,540
everyone there is so they said that it

833
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,640
was a pity that in the u.s.

834
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:22,009
entrepreneurship was supported and 75

835
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,819
percent of university students wanted to

836
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:27,320
be entrepreneurs being their own bosses

837
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:31,130
implementing the reindeer's and in Spain

838
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,610
it was the other way around it was very

839
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:39,830
hard

840
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:41,690
75% of students wanted stable job being

841
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:46,549
a civil servant which is okay if it's

842
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:47,050
your vocation to different ends of the

843
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,280
spectrum

844
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:51,140
[Music]

845
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:54,110
so entrepreneurship you could tell me

846
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:55,730
you're not an entrepreneur I was tempted

847
00:47:54,110 --> 00:48:01,760
in the past

848
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:05,359
and I sort of did something I created a

849
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,790
brand of a training it is true that it

850
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,310
goes in parallel with my activity but at

851
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:11,630
the end of the day it's some sort of

852
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,910
entrepreneurship because you need to

853
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:24,250
create the brand you have to promote it

854
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:27,649
sell it marketing our present our future

855
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,390
we have talent infinite resources in

856
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:32,750
order to develop it technology is

857
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:38,379
infinite we have every possibility at

858
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:46,850
our hand just a bit poetic today

859
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:47,390
tomorrow's jobs are created are we in a

860
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:49,009
bubble

861
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:51,830
many people ask about that it's cyber

862
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:54,200
security above all and many people in

863
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:57,700
this say yes it's a bubble but no it's

864
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:02,230
not and we have to insist that it's not

865
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:04,250
right now this guy and digital

866
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:08,150
transformation of companies going and

867
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:11,690
not just companies but society itself

868
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:14,660
societies digitally transform it itself

869
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:16,700
there's a danger of bridge digital gap

870
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,230
if you stayed behind you're going to

871
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,149
have serious problems that their

872
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,820
countries in Latin America with 50

873
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:24,740
percent of digital gap we're not in that

874
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:29,390
situation and we understand that

875
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:31,669
cybersecurity is applied to every new

876
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:35,000
paradigm er which is born in the new

877
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:38,180
digital world as a society and as a

878
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,140
company that's why we require more and

879
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:44,240
more profiles where this type of skills

880
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:45,799
just to give you a few examples the

881
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,470
Internet of Things

882
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:54,290
is going to offer a lot of development

883
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:59,390
for society but in order to be safe with

884
00:49:54,290 --> 00:50:05,570
this paradigm we need cyber security I a

885
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:07,910
big data and industry 4.0 perhaps in

886
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:11,600
Europe is more involved but in Spain

887
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:14,670
it's also a reality this creates a need

888
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:16,270
for profiles and there are more things

889
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:19,120
[Music]

890
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:22,340
there are many possibilities

891
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:26,060
with regards to jobs you need to focus

892
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:28,700
on what you want what you need so if you

893
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:31,990
have any question you can ask it or

894
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,990
maybe outside if you want

895
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:43,739
[Applause]

896
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:56,210
no take see see a perdón perdón make

897
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,779
Yahoo - al al final a more apparent a

898
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:00,369
problem here

899
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,369
based on my experience

900
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:08,900
what do you think about your hobby

901
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:10,490
becoming a job after many years when

902
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,640
your hobbies your job when you finish

903
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:16,939
your job and in the evening what do you

904
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,710
do when you're young you like it so much

905
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,050
that's not a problem

906
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:23,210
but then when here family you have a

907
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:26,150
difference but yet you're going to have

908
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:28,550
that situation any job how do you

909
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:31,430
establish a difference or if passion

910
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:33,680
wears off sometimes if you do the same

911
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:36,680
thing all the time if you depend testing

912
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:39,950
for five years at some point you say

913
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:42,859
it's not that cool anymore but perhaps

914
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:44,390
not there are people who have done the

915
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,220
same thing for 10 years and they haven't

916
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:48,799
lost the passion because they're

917
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:51,950
constantly learning but with time you

918
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,590
can lose your passion but in our

919
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:58,640
industry we're lucky enough to work and

920
00:51:54,590 --> 00:52:01,580
rotate we can do similar things but

921
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,950
there's that are different I can depend

922
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:07,850
testing and then a similar thing or I

923
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:10,069
can manage projects so you can change

924
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:13,130
roles within the same fields because you

925
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:15,050
need to evolve you cannot depend testing

926
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,720
for 40 years it wouldn't make sense

927
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:21,170
because people that come up to you

928
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:24,049
they're going to to be better than you

929
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:29,650
they have more information the faster or

930
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:29,650
whatever any other question

931
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,880
well thank you very much I leave you

932
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:38,880
with 70

933
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,860
[Applause]

934
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,890
