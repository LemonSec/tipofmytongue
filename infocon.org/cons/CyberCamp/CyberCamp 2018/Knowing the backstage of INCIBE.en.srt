and specialized furrows such as first

89
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,930
in 2017

90
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:38,090

91
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,160
incidents with different target audience

92
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:47,840
as you can see here based on the type of

department human resources and others at

172
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,890
this time I would like to focus on

173
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,230
work hurried out related to service

174
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,910
queue technologies we have our own

175
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:18,900
development capabilities for these

176
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:25,900
technologies and our main who is

177
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:30,100
supporting services provided by Incubus

178
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:36,040
and we have technology support for law

179
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:40,270
enforcement in fighting cyber terrorism

180
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:44,400
and we maintain the technology support

181
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,400
technology in in theory

182
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,930
we

183
00:11:49,050 --> 00:12:00,990
implements intelligence modeling

184
00:11:52,930 --> 00:12:07,089
cybersecurity and we carry out specific

185
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:11,310
security tasks for industrial labs its

186
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:15,610
goal is working jointly with

187
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:20,670
organizations that can do research and

188
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:24,480
experiment this takes place based on the

189
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:27,670
quality systems that we have in indium

190
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:35,260
we have systems in order to manage

191
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:38,219
information and other systems as I've

192
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:44,189
mentioned these activities which are not

193
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:51,900
so widely known we would like to explain

194
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:55,270
how we implement the so-called

195
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,569
cybersecurity threat intelligence what

196
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,569
is it

197
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:06,110
[Music]

198
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:09,580
based on experience there's no consensus

199
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:12,290
about its definition the different

200
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,550
interpretations depending on the

201
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,719
perspective of its entity for example

202
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:21,530
manufacturers that provide services

203
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:26,210
under this name if you study them you

204
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:33,170
will see that they have different

205
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:40,310
characteristics as a complementary we

206
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:43,839
have three example how an American

207
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:48,290
institution defines this term its

208
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:53,080
intelligence about sub threads gathered

209
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:56,030
and an assessed and analyzed and

210
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,650
Sarasota radiuses uncertainty and it

211
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:02,209
supports the consumer to identify

212
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:05,600
threats and opportunities the security

213
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:09,260
center of the UK defines this as the

214
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,530
information that helps in decision

215
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,930
making in order to prevent an attack or

216
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:18,100
reduce the time period in which an

217
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,099
attack is discovered

218
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,729
Sinisa defiance of the processing

219
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:29,768
product that results of interpreting

220
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:32,870
data has to do with recognizing

221
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:37,220
attackers among other things these

222
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:42,470
definitions are similar somehow but they

223
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:44,449
have supplementary elements we need even

224
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,709
we have adopted our own model in order

225
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:51,378
to provide an answer to our needs and we

226
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:58,369
focus on providing services in this

227
00:14:51,379 --> 00:15:01,329
sense we define knowledge based and

228
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:05,209
evidencing from the contact mechanism

229
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:08,269
indicators implications and recommended

230
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:11,388
actions with regards to potential

231
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:15,790
threats and assets that can be used to

232
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:15,790
take informed decisions

233
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:32,690
in this sense this model cold mix it's a

234
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:38,329
circular process all the phases feedback

235
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:44,120
each other and it's similar to the

236
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:51,820
intelligence cycle with military

237
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,820
intelligence these models have phases

238
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,850
related

239
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:06,870
the identification side of things you

240
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:10,889
identify your goal you collect

241
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:14,690
information you assess we identify it

242
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:19,100
and then you disseminate the information

243
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:22,949
in our case our model is based on

244
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:25,829
provision of services we answer

245
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:33,380
questions that have to do with our

246
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:36,779
mission as a national entity detection

247
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:40,470
is about hospital with obtaining and

248
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:42,889
then the analysis is similar to the

249
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:47,149
American model of intelligence

250
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:53,930
intelligence could be production and

251
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:53,930
services corresponds to dissemination

252
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:08,770
we apply this in services the

253
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,770
architecture of this model is scalable

254
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,180
[Music]

255
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:24,670
I need to point out that their necessary

256
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:26,139
components for example stakeholders our

257
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:31,290
target audience

258
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:38,080
citizens companies law enforcement and

259
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:41,490
some communities we consider we take

260
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:47,350
parts into account universities and

261
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:52,140
public institutions and a basic

262
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:54,669
component analysts so human profiles

263
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:58,480
what is known in the intelligence world

264
00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:01,630
as he human human intelligence

265
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,630
[Music]

266
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:14,570
that defines the intelligence cycle and

267
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:20,130
which defines the intelligence model of

268
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:25,110
enfeeble so regarding detection phase it

269
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:27,450
is the main phase for data gathering so

270
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:33,209
here we have our own sources or

271
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:35,159
third-party sources so all sources in

272
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,940
terms of own sources we have developed

273
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:44,220
our own technology for data gathering so

274
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:46,220
regarding third party sources so here we

275
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,929
have three types of information

276
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:56,690
Austin information or information from

277
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:59,490
open sources as well as that we have

278
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,090
agreements and corporations with the

279
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,409
private sector or international

280
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:09,928
organization as well as commercial

281
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:14,640
sources so when it comes to Derek a

282
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:19,140
dream so well we this air Academy has to

283
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:24,390
follow a number of requirements so the

284
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:26,789
main criteria is about seeing whether we

285
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,990
can apply it to other model and second

286
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:34,090
whether these data are complete precise

287
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:37,990
accurate consistent and

288
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:41,678
relevant is there delay from detection

289
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:45,429
upon sealed reception in our model that

290
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:53,559
is to say whether timeless fits in with

291
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:57,070
our services all these is monitored by

292
00:19:53,559 --> 00:20:01,600
the quality assurance system that

293
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:03,639
through alerts and alarms checks the

294
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:10,418
feeling of this information on an

295
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:13,559
ongoing basis so in analysis phase this

296
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:17,590
is faith world era become information

297
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:19,720
that transformation of data into

298
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:23,049
information requires number of processes

299
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,890
first of all enrichment process that

300
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:29,529
would allow us to contextualize the data

301
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:32,890
gathered so therefore we have to look

302
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:37,770
well we want data to have higher value

303
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:43,240
and lower volatility triage analyst to

304
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:45,580
prioritize data so during analysis we

305
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:52,330
carry out a number of validations and

306
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:54,780
checks that allow us to rule out false

307
00:20:52,330 --> 00:21:05,020
positives

308
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:08,649
so in aggregation process we want to

309
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:13,900
aggregate the application of information

310
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:16,840
and if we get data from same event or

311
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,300
the same fact fact we want to see what

312
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:26,370
is the level of relatedness between the

313
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:32,260
different sources used the cleaning

314
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:35,139
system allows us to eliminate noise or

315
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:38,230
those no value data for instance a

316
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:47,020
dynamic IP if we do not have a time

317
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:54,730
stamp about the event detection so the

318
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:58,150
data is no longer available is of low

319
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:00,100
value and then the data if there is no

320
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,160
time stamp associated to it is also

321
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:07,449
highly volatile now talking about Big

322
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:11,590
Data so what it is well we are

323
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:15,000
interested in not imagining big data but

324
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,000
in quality data

325
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,770
now intelligence face

326
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:30,080
it is the faith where we have a

327
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:34,730
correlation processes and we implement

328
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:38,330
different operational flows to respond

329
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,310
to the use cases applicable service

330
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:43,129
services these are primarily based the

331
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:46,540
rules and rules and algorithms that

332
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:50,450
allow us to respond to those needs for

333
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:55,159
provision of our services so here we

334
00:22:50,450 --> 00:23:01,570
also generate indicators indicators in

335
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:06,620
three main levels operational indicators

336
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:09,050
indicators of compromise allowing us to

337
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:13,550
respond to incidents then tactical

338
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:17,030
indicators where indicators informed

339
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:21,230
decision making process internally plans

340
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:23,930
as well to manage resources for

341
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:28,910
integration of new systems and then in

342
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:35,000
some surface tragedy indicators here we

343
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:41,680
can identify new services or evaluate

344
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:47,350
ongoing services as well as of policies

345
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:52,640
the last phase of this model will be

346
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:56,240
dissemination and our process finishes

347
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:00,700
up in service delivery through different

348
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,700
use cases as we can see here

349
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,919
[Music]

350
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:14,040
our disguises practice detection of

351
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:17,580
incidents to respond actively through in

352
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:22,730
civil search or through the anti anti

353
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:26,549
pot system so this process should be as

354
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:28,460
near to real-time as possible which is

355
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:32,340
also very important for this use case

356
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:38,669
and this is intelligence model is also

357
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:43,110
aimed at having knowledge based to be

358
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:44,549
used by in civil and also in our

359
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:52,010
collaboration with the enforcement

360
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:55,710
agencies we are also we are identifying

361
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:58,740
new needs to find universe services and

362
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:02,210
we analyze new needs through new trends

363
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:07,220
and as I say to make our services more

364
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:10,980
efficient now that use case in our model

365
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,260
would be capability to exchange

366
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,250
information for different types of

367
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,250
collaborations

368
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:30,679
as well as having a framework

369
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:34,700
for cybersecurity and as well as trace

370
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:36,500
use for early alerts an early warning

371
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,740
now I'd like to share with you a

372
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:43,670
practical case for you to see how our

373
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:46,160
model responds to one of those early

374
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,780
alert cases that I just referred to I

375
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:53,380
don't know whether you are aware of

376
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:59,120
typosquatting well this is English term

377
00:25:53,380 --> 00:26:02,840
so this is comes from title which is to

378
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:09,040
say like a typing mistake or typing

379
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:09,040
error and then exploring which is the

380
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:23,620
illegal settlement in property so by

381
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:26,700
taking advantage of typing errors

382
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,699
[Music]

383
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:32,929
domains are similar to the legit domain

384
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,379
are registered so this type of

385
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:45,380
techniques are primarily used for

386
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:48,640
spoofing and they also use what vectors

387
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:54,470
of attack abused are the actual spamming

388
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:59,990
and to launch incident such as phishing

389
00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:02,930
for data theft this is yes and when I'm

390
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:05,750
showing in the screen is an example but

391
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:11,050
if you have a legit domain resist the

392
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:11,050
bank they name the branch

393
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:20,860
then we have different variations of the

394
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:24,730
name here in in FIBA and travel

395
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:28,530
cooperation with Fred yes which are in

396
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:35,799
charge of registering Internet domains

397
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:41,490
in this country on a daily basis and

398
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:49,658
neutralizes Terra Cotta TLT Dutch es are

399
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:53,880
check through near algorithms so

400
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:59,440
whenever we detect that there is

401
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:03,909
potential for impersonation an alert is

402
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:08,169
triggered then we identify whether this

403
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:11,380
is an actual type scoring event and if

404
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:15,340
this is a case we let our colleagues as

405
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:19,659
in fever hurt to be aware of it and to

406
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:23,289
respond to it if there is a case we

407
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:29,100
report it to the entity that has been

408
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:32,900
affected then in parallel to that the

409
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:35,959
domain is cancelled

410
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,600
this is just one of the examples of the

411
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:43,700
use cases that we implement in our

412
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:47,090
intelligence model and last and also

413
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:50,450
related to Moody's I'd like to give you

414
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:56,360
this reference the reference to the

415
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:59,330
challenges that we are proposing at

416
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:07,669
athenian through the public procurement

417
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:10,340
of about innovation we have disseminated

418
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,890
that from our original government so you

419
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:16,610
may be interested in taking part of it

420
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:20,270
so now we are as a preliminary face of

421
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:23,320
the public procurement of innovation so

422
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:27,100
the challenges are aimed at finding

423
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:30,950
innovation solutions to solve

424
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:33,290
Princeton's detection of pods and

425
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:37,190
commands and control also detection of

426
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:38,629
onion domains that are not indexed by

427
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,880
public entities the textual

428
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:44,170
categorization and automatic prediction

429
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,170
of cyber attacks

430
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:57,590
I'll allow it to generate a high level

431
00:29:54,769 --> 00:30:01,220
of knowledge in terms of detecting and

432
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:06,559
containing real attacks would invite you

433
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:09,799
to visit this website and for you to see

434
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,860
whether you could contribute that

435
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:17,299
innovation that we are asking for and

436
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:19,729
looking for so these are our contact

437
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:23,600
details and I'd like to thank you for

438
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:26,820
being here and for your attention

439
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,820
[Applause]

440
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,649
you
