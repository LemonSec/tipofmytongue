00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:10,060
[Music]

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:18,599
well mmm good morning everyone

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,180
last year in Santander I gave these

4
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:24,360
presentation or rather the first part of

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:28,050
this presentation last year we focused

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:31,079
more on the threat agents and today we

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,930
will be talking more about the behavior

8
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:36,180
of that threat so this is an

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,860
introduction about myself

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,470
brief introduction and nowadays

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,570
everything is interconnected or

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,760
connected as our colleague from National

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,950
Police Force mentioned nowadays

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,070
everything is connected to the Internet

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,700
proprietary networks or non proprietary

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:01:02,220
networks and as we can see here we have

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:04,140
also satellite communications also lower

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,070
communications coverage health through

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,229
drones digital networks everything is

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,589
interconnected through global

21
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,110
information grid they are flowing all

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,930
the time because they're flowing can be

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:21,750
intercepted can be modified and changed

24
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,409
so regarding the perspective of the

25
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,990
citizens we have smart cities citizens

26
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:32,580
will have smart meters electronic

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:35,580
mirrors then the public electricity

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,710
water mirrors everything is connected to

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,850
the internet so that service provider

30
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:45,048
utility providers can make better or be

31
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:49,020
more efficient manage the service better

32
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:52,130
etc all that that is interconnected such

33
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,880
as video cameras surveillance cameras

34
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,500
traffic lights everything which is

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,300
connected in the net

36
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,760
can be accessed through deleted

37
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:07,220
proprietary and I'll also be accessed

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:10,490
through alleged or non legit users and

39
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:13,940
as I said before last year I'll focus

40
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:16,880
more on the threat agents and the multi

41
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,450
gauge makes their motivations and this

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,690
year we will be focusing more on

43
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:26,600
vulnerabilities cyber threat and this

44
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:29,410
year I will focus on the top part of the

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:33,829
pyramid we have several types of agents

46
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:35,510
criminals as the our police colleague

47
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,580
mentioned police officer colleague

48
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:40,160
mentioned we are not that much worried

49
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,680
about that criminals will focus more on

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,430
hacktivists

51
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,070
criminal hackers organization and also

52
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,620
disgruntled employees I've never met any

53
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,720
of them but they are also well put the

54
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,560
time considered as possible threat

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,640
agents and then halfway through we when

56
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,730
we are talking about the military

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,920
industry we should not forget about

58
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:08,290
competitors competition between

59
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:15,619
companies perhaps may create some

60
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:19,040
offensive attacks to steal IP property

61
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,340
but our main adversaries would always be

62
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,850
foreign actions as well as hacktivists

63
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,310
groups which are the main agents there

64
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:31,180
will be attempted growing against the

65
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,180
rule of law

66
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:43,459
criminals way more often than not be

67
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:43,459
mercenaries working for foreign nations

68
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,989
today we will be focusing on

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:58,920
characterizations nowadays we have

70
00:03:51,990 --> 00:04:00,630
several models Mitra disease

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,739
characterization of the different phases

72
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,380
of an attack the first step is having

73
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:12,020
the attacker search in the

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:12,019
infrastructure that wants to attack

75
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,820
once the attacker is one of our of the

76
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,519
content of the infrastructure has

77
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,250
detected the potential attacker has to

78
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,389
generate a weapon therefore has to be

79
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:36,460
weaponized - for his attack once he has

80
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:39,100
his blood he will deliver it often

81
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,289
because companies and the stateís spend

82
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,590
lots of money on perimeter security

83
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:46,389
often what they do is the launch

84
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,729
spearfishing campaigns targeted

85
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:52,000
campaigns targeted attacks so their

86
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:56,080
potential victims fall into the trap and

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,710
that food they go over their bypass

88
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,469
parametric defense because email most of

89
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,469
public entities and companies but they

90
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,849
have email accounts enabled so once you

91
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:13,229
get an email and you open attachments

92
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:16,840
this is enough for attackers to launch a

93
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:20,500
multi-phase attack and to take to take

94
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,599
control of very many devices and start

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,380
to move laterally within the

96
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:29,740
organization then we have the execution

97
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:33,130
then but it is most important in the

98
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:36,849
cases is the command and control of that

99
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,830
threat often the attackers want to be

100
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:44,800
persistent in the victim that is to say

101
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:48,820
to spend much less possible time in the

102
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,139
facilities in the organization attackers

103
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:56,500
want to steal information for long long

104
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:59,770
times to get a wealth of information but

105
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,630
sometimes such as Ames are stealing some

106
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,740
credentials so therefore the objective

107
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:11,009
is not persistent they just steal the

108
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:16,200
information and then they go away and

109
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:19,570
that well then they

110
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,599
introduce malware so that forensic

111
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:25,419
analysis doesn't cannot gather any

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:30,160
digital evidence after the attack so

113
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:33,159
from the defensive viewpoints so someone

114
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,919
has developed di Casey which is a model

115
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,780
which allows to generate intelligence in

116
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:43,330
the past we saw the different phases of

117
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:48,489
an attack so i casey is breaking the

118
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:51,400
activities covered by the attacker in

119
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,740
every stage the move we can attack the

120
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,539
offensive offensive actions of the

121
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:01,450
adversary the better our defense

122
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:08,139
mechanism defensive mechanism well in

123
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:09,969
any organization often well often people

124
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,210
know that they are being attacked

125
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,740
because someone has been infiltrated

126
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:20,760
then flag is raised

127
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:24,640
so therefore mitigation measures are

128
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,909
implemented right away and then evidence

129
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,710
is gathered i really the recognition

130
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,320
face that is to say when the attacker

131
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:37,000
has not infiltrated the organization

132
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:40,020
said we wonderful to know the intention

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,020
of the attacker

134
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,110
and that information can be gathered

135
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,730
from the deputies to say to prevent

136
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,480
further action on the part of the

137
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:54,000
criminal but more often than not the but

138
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,940
the organization's end up being reactive

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,400
rather than proactive but as really they

140
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,190
should be proactive attackers well at

141
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:06,239
the end of the day are involved in

142
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:11,520
business again as I said before cyber

143
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,410
criminals have as an objective to

144
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,390
monitor the attack as much as possible

145
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,850
so a person who doesn't want to attack a

146
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,390
government but citizens develop some

147
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:22,920
ransomware

148
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:28,650
and this person wants to make 200 or 400

149
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:31,080
euros - well - as a ransom for the

150
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:33,600
information stolen often through

151
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,130
cryptocurrencies so in this case they

152
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,690
want their attack to be highly effective

153
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:42,210
so if a criminal says I'm going to steal

154
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:45,060
credentials from individual so therefore

155
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:47,490
I have to look for the operating system

156
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,790
which is more widely disseminated so

157
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,880
that I can maximize my profit if the

158
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,010
operating system which is more

159
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,290
widespread disease for instance Windows

160
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,720
7 this person will develop something to

161
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,490
cover against Windows 7 then they

162
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,010
distribute the launcher delivery

163
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,370
campaign for instance through emails and

164
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:12,170
say okay emails which coincides with the

165
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:15,180
I don't know campaign for filing returns

166
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,760
and that is okay I will be sending out

167
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,189
ten thousand emails and then one hundred

168
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,910
of them will be will have their

169
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:26,130
attachment open therefore I will be

170
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,120
successful enough but organizations who

171
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,120
want to steal IP

172
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:37,180
property often the victims have invested

173
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:41,480
in defense so therefore they have to

174
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:45,910
sophisticate the attack moon and often

175
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:49,340
they go to the black market buy explodes

176
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:53,689
that is to say because of the potential

177
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:56,480
victims have good security and

178
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,370
protection in place but in this case the

179
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,610
return on investment for this criminal

180
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:05,360
is not monetization of the actual attack

181
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:08,690
but it is just control so let us say

182
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,930
therefore state well the money is not

183
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,880
very important but it is very important

184
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,160
for criminals criminals in charge of

185
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,920
developing an exploit maybe working in

186
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,079
both fields and to see who what I could

187
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,209
get the highest profit and therefore

188
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:28,430
disciple that I want to sell that to

189
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:31,550
private individuals or to stakes so if

190
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:34,189
you do they zero effect doesn't really

191
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,800
make sense to sell it if you can't get

192
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,500
much more money if you sell it as an

193
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,880
exploiting the black market so now in

194
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:46,100
terms of defensive perspective so it's

195
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,990
good but it's actually interesting here

196
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,700
is to develop resilience metrics to see

197
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,950
how much you can contain an attack from

198
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,940
the operational viewpoint you have to

199
00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:01,310
have the overall view or to be aware of

200
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,610
the whole picture of our intrusion and

201
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:08,780
the use of intelligence in these tools

202
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:11,870
and infrastructure so you have to frame

203
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:15,199
these potential threats what do you need

204
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:18,800
to have like overall picture of the

205
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,680
threat imagine that are being elections

206
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,390
in a given country probably this is a

207
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,439
good time for foreign agents to take

208
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,769
action

209
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:35,639
so sometimes information out of context

210
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:40,319
is not relevant so later on we will see

211
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:46,470
how the geopolitical context goes into

212
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:50,339
all this play so we gather information

213
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:52,649
from attacks Purim from the operation

214
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,889
system or from the actual sample for

215
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:59,220
instance if we sent our detect that the

216
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:04,550
threat has been sent through an email we

217
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:07,829
just get well analyzed infected

218
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:11,160
computers and then we see what type of

219
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:14,729
intuition has that been well command and

220
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,730
control attack of attackers often last

221
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:22,170
very short and intrusions often survive

222
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:25,079
for 24 maximum 48 hours Tasmin

223
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,849
command-and-control expires so if we get

224
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:32,339
the sample of the evidence to be

225
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:34,290
analyzed at 72 hours later we will only

226
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,449
have information about where the

227
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,880
intrusion was started however if someone

228
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:43,609
has seized the computer we could gather

229
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,610
the full evidence and then to analyze

230
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:54,490
the top often

231
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:57,550
trician people do not fully deploy what

232
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:00,580
they don't provide a full potential one

233
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:03,459
of the actions that may want to cover is

234
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,410
to pass a notice if you have a day zero

235
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,190
exploding the first phase of the attack

236
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:11,650
you are kind of making or communicating

237
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,870
that you have good resources to commit

238
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:18,010
to carry out an attack okay say like

239
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:20,380
100,000 or 200,000 dollars and we know

240
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:25,240
that for instance young people okay to

241
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:29,370
not have those financial capabilities so

242
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:33,190
hand therefore as I say it is clear that

243
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:35,560
attack such as Stuxnet that would never

244
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,839
be carried out by a group of university

245
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,219
students that require a huge financial

246
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,690
and investment to carry out that type of

247
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,600
investigation to find it when ability is

248
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:49,720
developing a relevant exploit and then

249
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,630
to deploy it to largest supplier you

250
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:56,380
will need classic intelligence and then

251
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:59,740
to go to isolate never through a UA and

252
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:02,920
then well you will have trolley to drive

253
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,010
a person and those type of attacks can

254
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,099
only be committed by attacks or by

255
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:11,529
companies in charge of managing huge

256
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,390
industrial installation this is not like

257
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,120
what we see in the movie having an

258
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:19,330
individual at home behind a computer and

259
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:24,040
then sending out an exploit note that is

260
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:26,110
not the way it goes and now from the

261
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,439
operational viewpoint as I said before

262
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:32,980
is to find the gravity centers that

263
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:38,740
prioritize the use of resources and now

264
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:41,440
we often use apt apt to for organized

265
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,610
group in banking they use fin well at

266
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,310
the end of the day we are talking about

267
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:50,220
the same thing so people who are paid

268
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:54,119
have but given financial resources to

269
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,509
cause significant financial harm going

270
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,990
against company state you name it from

271
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:05,519
the viewpoint of an campaign analysis we

272
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:08,160
have what we look into the techniques

273
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:17,069
used by Attica that is to say we found

274
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:20,939
out how they operate and well so this is

275
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:24,750
the diamond model of full intuition so

276
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:26,759
we have full practices adversarial

277
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,160
victims on top and at the bottom and

278
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:31,500
then an infrastructure and capability

279
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,759
but we add meta characteristics emitter

280
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:38,610
features to it and we also are a social

281
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:43,379
political context and a technology

282
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:46,850
context linking all this it is very

283
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:50,189
important to be aware of key dates

284
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:53,040
milestone days that may be relevant for

285
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:56,129
organized crime group because of many

286
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:03,300
reasons religious reasons political

287
00:15:56,129 --> 00:16:06,779
reasons and at specific dates we have to

288
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:10,109
raise our alerts because they are very

289
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:13,699
likely to take actions so especially

290
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:16,350
through denial of service campaigns

291
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:19,399
which are more often than not used by

292
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,399
hockey lists

293
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:32,689
this could also be represented in this

294
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:39,660
graph clear crap so we have several

295
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:41,630
campaigns so if a given point in time if

296
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:47,180
we analyze how these operations are

297
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:51,210
being cut out we can see that we have

298
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:55,199
repeated patterns so when do have

299
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:57,090
patterns received we could infer that

300
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,430
this has been carried out by the same

301
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:02,010
people or by the same group of people or

302
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,930
people who have related to each other so

303
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:06,300
if we see a connection between different

304
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,119
campaigns probably there is a link

305
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,879
between the agents behind those

306
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,280
campaigns from the financial perspective

307
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,959
is very easy to have a financial

308
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:22,649
organized-crime group doing that and

309
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,839
from the viewpoints of also of crimes

310
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:27,600
against estates broadly we have the same

311
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:31,159
organized group behind that if we find

312
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:34,350
these repeated pattern then in terms of

313
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,520
processing activity groups this allows

314
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:43,409
us to define the analytical problem

315
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:47,910
others mitra model on the left as we can

316
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:49,980
see it is aimed as practive detection

317
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:53,390
and on the right we see incident

318
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:56,790
response forensics and mitigation and

319
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,860
mission assurance is about having the

320
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,840
system working from a reactive viewpoint

321
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,580
where as a proactive part is about

322
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,580
preventing entry

323
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,740
Mitra has developed this stable

324
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:22,560
characterization of classification table

325
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:24,720
it is available for free in the website

326
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,169
so if you have a threat and you want to

327
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,290
characterize it you feel information out

328
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,780
in that matrix so as you are carrying

329
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:37,200
out your analysis you are feeling these

330
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:40,110
boxes and here this is a good example of

331
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:44,430
it is a broken-down example of carbon

332
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:46,139
black we see the purple I can read it

333
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,960
from here but probably you kind of read

334
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,990
it from where you are sitting so imagine

335
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,070
that the port 4 4 3 is being exploited

336
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:58,590
then you enter this area in these matrix

337
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,290
what is the advantage of it once you

338
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:05,730
have characterized the threat that you

339
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:08,700
are receiving then you have defined the

340
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,850
fresh and you can submit it to your

341
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,760
managers to your boss often bosses do

342
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,620
not have technical understanding of what

343
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,430
is happening however these matrix

344
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:24,449
analysis to present the threat so it

345
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:29,640
makes it easier to understand what is

346
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:33,870
happening so you don't need to explain

347
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:38,610
what is being used for the otaku but it

348
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:41,699
is very easy to display and to show and

349
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:45,090
us and analysts also can find these of

350
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,340
help reporting could be very lengthy and

351
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,490
tedious and this table gives you a

352
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,100
patent good guideline to follow for

353
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,890
reporting and actually this method is

354
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,240
more and more popular as it's being

355
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:02,810
found to be very helpful to present

356
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,460
threats and this is not only about

357
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:08,280
escalating aid or useful to escalated

358
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,830
within you organization by also to share

359
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,010
it with other organizations if we use

360
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:16,740
the same language or the same system to

361
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,770
classify a threat for instance if we

362
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,720
send out these metrics to Belgium or any

363
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,090
other countries and they also use these

364
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,990
very same matrix

365
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:29,870
trickster we'll use it right away and

366
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:34,520
now we have five fire

367
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:39,110
early-model so Mitra is flat model and

368
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:43,460
this one has a loop in it this model in

369
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:52,040
system focuses on persistence so there

370
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:57,530
is no one only model which is valid like

371
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:59,149
fire I model because he displays or

372
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:02,110
focuses on lateral movement and

373
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,110
persistence

374
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:11,080
when we want to characterize the fresh

375
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:14,809
in durban sources we can use for it

376
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:20,600
first phase is about collecting

377
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:23,360
information from open sources that

378
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,340
requires to cover some work that can be

379
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,408
automated through tools for instance

380
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:34,000
tools to search websites and others

381
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:38,330
however other type of actions require

382
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,269
hard work because for instance going to

383
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:44,449
Jack's Nets in the darkness you can

384
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:46,009
really use crawler that using natural

385
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,710
language processing gets all the

386
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:52,129
information that you need no it is not

387
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:54,470
as easy as so sometimes when people are

388
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:58,070
interacting in their firm they may be

389
00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:04,779
interacting with people from FBI CIA or

390
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:07,580
NSA who are working on aid and

391
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:12,080
collecting useful information for that

392
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:14,090
first face and information is gathered

393
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,639
through the scanning after campaign if

394
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,220
you log into forums such as anonymous

395
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:22,879
you can't really see interaction that is

396
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,769
taking place between them so these will

397
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:26,449
give you a feel as to whether they are

398
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:29,870
going to launch a denial of service

399
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:34,730
attack against the Department of Defense

400
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:39,258
okay and you can brace or trigger early

401
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:44,299
and on then here we have Jack nerds and

402
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:47,210
then often attackers use it to hide

403
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:50,418
themselves and then from there they have

404
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,340
your lateral attacks they pivot from

405
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:55,370
that from their defensive viewpoints

406
00:22:52,340 --> 00:23:00,649
that's where we work what we do is that

407
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:02,959
we just place probes in those sub points

408
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:05,090
to see whether there are some processes

409
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,129
which are being run in the memory

410
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,760
whether there are any indicators of

411
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:12,949
compromise so this allows us to have

412
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,670
temporary telemetry for us to see to

413
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,340
check

414
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,220
the status of our network then scanning

415
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:23,178
and indexing some people do not really

416
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:25,970
like to do internal auditing including

417
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:28,460
tan-tan testing I feel that pen testing

418
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,280
is very important very useful to

419
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,730
strengthen your own devices whether it

420
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:37,309
is white box black box red box often

421
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:40,070
people have the luxans to scanning and

422
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:41,780
indexing and especially in industrial

423
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,280
environment if you go and send someone

424
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,809
at a nuclear power facility that you

425
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,928
want to tear it up in testing trolly

426
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:49,820
them not unfree with it if we were to do

427
00:23:47,929 --> 00:23:52,720
pen testing will help us find

428
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:58,220
vulnerabilities and block them but often

429
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:00,559
managers have our threat of pen testing

430
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,360
getting out of control and causing any

431
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,860
type of harm so that's why it is

432
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,379
difficult to get that information about

433
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,830
vulnerabilities now malware processing

434
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:13,190
this is well other things that we do

435
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,840
other than forensic analysis and this is

436
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,510
what you can get the most information

437
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,600
from it I'm not saying this because

438
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:25,940
that's what I do but because it is the

439
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:29,178
way it is so if you succeed are finding

440
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:33,490
a sample which is being run in your

441
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:36,320
network to get lots of information so

442
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:40,010
anyway you will subscribe and you will

443
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,950
get like Fred bulletins well to me what

444
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:45,500
is happening to a bank maybe none of my

445
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,570
business because it is not my business

446
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:51,460
but I really need to know what is

447
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:53,870
happening in other NATO countries

448
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,600
because what is happening in other

449
00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:02,120
native countries we probably reached me

450
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:05,120
very soon so if in other NATO country

451
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:09,399
they analysed a threat and they reported

452
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:13,309
to me we will be using it or vice versa

453
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:18,360
so therefore we will not have to

454
00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:23,740
duplicate any work

455
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:26,709
well do not believe that the 500 malware

456
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:29,590
analysts like you see on TV there are

457
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:32,500
only few group of dedicated people it is

458
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:37,658
very costly to train dedicated people

459
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:44,380
specialized in malware processing some

460
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:49,269
resources devoted to malware allows us

461
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:51,610
to train as I say people experts in

462
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:53,620
malware and then what information is

463
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,320
shared and then social engineering

464
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:01,239
coming to events such as this one could

465
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:04,090
be a very good way to recruit talent if

466
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,649
you wealth you if you come over here you

467
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:11,559
may ruin networking you may meet people

468
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:17,260
people want to make me people who may

469
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:20,470
sell exploits you who will be helping

470
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:22,690
you out so we should not forget about a

471
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,870
human interaction as a good source of

472
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:28,840
information so famous image of the

473
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:30,820
icepack dark web in the case of

474
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,570
government this is the main source of

475
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:37,418
information about what is happening but

476
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:39,908
we should not forget that surface web

477
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:42,490
also delivers significant amount of

478
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:47,049
information so for instance we have lots

479
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:50,679
of open source code or github that could

480
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:52,899
be useful malicious activities well

481
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,299
someone may just post our information

482
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:57,639
with no bad intention but whether but it

483
00:26:55,299 --> 00:27:00,460
is clear that if you find and exploit in

484
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:03,309
a website such as github but there is no

485
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:05,470
control about what comes in and out then

486
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:07,690
you get the source code and you may

487
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:10,149
analyze it and you may set up a

488
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,250
Frankenstein malware which are all the

489
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:13,959
malware samples that have been kind of

490
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,059
cutting and paste from here and there

491
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,550
and if you compiler and you're

492
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:19,710
successful at it you

493
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,800
but distribute it and you may be

494
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:27,630
successful so these things are easier to

495
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:30,330
make if you well in these portals okay

496
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:33,060
but if you want to go too well to

497
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:36,659
exploit you will have to go to dark web

498
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:40,520
that were all these things are hidden

499
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:45,170
and then whether you may buy exploit get

500
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:49,080
$35 or $40 that allows you to create a

501
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:54,930
malware campaign and to distribute it

502
00:27:49,080 --> 00:28:00,030
easily so well this is very important

503
00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:02,460
for operations to be aware of so you can

504
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,710
configure a number of options such as

505
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,310
debugging and all that if you're lucky

506
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:10,890
enough you can even buy her defensive

507
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:14,210
measures of no classified networks of

508
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,740
corporations so that does not require

509
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:20,930
significant effort and could also help

510
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:24,150
you to hide some campaigns in some cases

511
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:27,340
as I was saying

512
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:29,380
we don't have enough talented people in

513
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:36,699
the big corporations devoted to more

514
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:43,240
analysis and very often we may hire

515
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:46,450
cyber security companies usually SMEs do

516
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,660
not have specific staff devoted to days

517
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:53,470
and it's only the big corporations that

518
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:55,960
have people in-house for that and even

519
00:28:53,470 --> 00:29:00,880
those cases they use companies just

520
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:05,590
Deloitte as to and others that provide

521
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:08,289
services at a very high price and they

522
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:10,899
monitor your networks they have foreign

523
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:12,760
six services more knowledge and services

524
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,240
and so many companies are cheaper than

525
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:19,840
having people in-house and as I've said

526
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,789
before they don't have the problem of

527
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,110
looking for talent the talent is

528
00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:28,169
constant trying to did a bunch of

529
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:28,168
companies and the others just hire them

530
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:40,169
analysis it's very important if you want

531
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,169
to be a step ahead of a threat

532
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:50,740
at work will receive a lot of bugs and

533
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:54,100
many are generic any ransomware you may

534
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:59,409
receive at home same campaigns of the

535
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:02,100
email we don't care about them but there

536
00:29:59,409 --> 00:30:05,580
are samples which are more targeted and

537
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:08,408
we had to analyze them

538
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:12,580
it may take you between two days or a

539
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:15,730
week and you can see what's there in

540
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:19,509
your bug static and dynamic behavior you

541
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:24,009
send and with a report and the rights

542
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:28,509
measures are applied especially

543
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:30,909
disinfection what computers have been

544
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:35,879
infected and then a few days ago a

545
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:39,399
report is published on open sources with

546
00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:41,860
sample which is similar to yours perhaps

547
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:44,018
a different hash but it's similar and

548
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,570
it's clear that it was designed by the

549
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:49,179
same group that attacked you it's really

550
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:52,809
easy for an attacker to modify small

551
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:56,019
details so that it's not exactly the

552
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:58,629
same thing in this way the they avoid

553
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:59,590
antivirus because antivirus are usually

554
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:03,279
quite weak

555
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:06,220
if you use an anti-virus it analyzes the

556
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,529
hash and if they know it it's okay and

557
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,649
if they don't know it that was it there

558
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:14,889
more parameters that can be analyzed be

559
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:16,570
besides the full hash of a file to

560
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:21,789
establish whether it's a good about to

561
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:23,980
file the next slide we'll see if they

562
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:27,490
belong to the same family the Dalton

563
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:30,610
brothers they'll evil in this case we

564
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:32,769
can see there are reports which are very

565
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,279
similar to yours and you had a few days

566
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:35,279
in advance

567
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,970
companies that sell cyber intelligence

568
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:42,370
on this type of information when it's

569
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:44,620
published they limit what they're

570
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,209
offering because I've talked to them in

571
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,899
events and they say there's some details

572
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:51,790
that they omit because they're

573
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,190
interested in selling a premium product

574
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:58,149
to third parties or for whatever reason

575
00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:02,440
they didn't want to inform the attacker

576
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:06,190
about how they could obtain that type of

577
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:09,700
information we have deep reports

578
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,550
compared to what they've published and I

579
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,050
was surprised to see that they didn't

580
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,600
reach the conclusion that were reached

581
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:22,030
because once you've reached point C D

582
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:24,340
and E were easy we must say that very

583
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,960
often your bosses do not allow you to

584
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,310
devote all the time of the world to your

585
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,880
samples and you have to stop at some

586
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:33,310
point but in case I think it's because

587
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,350
they decided not to share it if you're

588
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:38,790
not familiar with malware analysis

589
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:43,629
there's something called compromised

590
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:46,180
indicators of compromise which is the

591
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:49,810
characterization of a sample if there's

592
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:54,240
a command server the apd connects to if

593
00:32:49,810 --> 00:33:01,110
it uses series a function of windows api

594
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:07,920
hashes this type of things are

595
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:10,929
characteristics that may make up an IOC

596
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:13,630
with your tools you can verify whether

597
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:16,450
they are uses you've developed but there

598
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:21,100
are more computers in your network that

599
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:23,710
are infected that's why it's worth

600
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:26,500
make it an IOC if I know there's a bug

601
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:29,019
that it's creating a persistent skin my

602
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,940
register I'll do something so it

603
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:36,759
analyzes the key to see that if the new

604
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:40,299
computer has this clear indicator that

605
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:44,880
the computer has been compromised if we

606
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:47,379
include a lot of and or at some point

607
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,480
we'll have lower probability of false

608
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:53,259
positives so we'll have an IOC which

609
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,529
will be effective for our organization

610
00:33:53,259 --> 00:34:00,210
of this IOC have more value if you share

611
00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:04,240
them with other people because of course

612
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:08,859
you save them the time for the technical

613
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,349
part and they can directly search the

614
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:14,440
networks from these samples or a similar

615
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:16,750
one if you're not good in Krajina you

616
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:22,109
see we're going to have false positives

617
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:22,109
false negative which which is worse

618
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:30,450
disadvantages have explained with a

619
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:34,290
Dimond lack of context that's not good

620
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:37,679
you need to know why that sample that I

621
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:39,719
you see if a sample is valid for you if

622
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,149
I receive one from banking that's not

623
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,149
useful for me there's no context you say

624
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:47,190
this is and I use if you're not

625
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:50,100
attacking something I'm interested in

626
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:55,200
I don't have it running and I own a

627
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:55,799
computer just one takes about 15 20

628
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:02,970
minutes

629
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:03,480
what happened a charlatan pantalla

630
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,450
Valley

631
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:12,140
well I'll continue with other talk sir

632
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:12,140
it's even more boring do I wait

633
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:22,100
the idea of IOC is sharing

634
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:29,189
I'll go to the last part of our

635
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:34,609
presentation there are presentations

636
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:39,140
such as maze but is free people can

637
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:39,140
create collaboration portals

638
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:54,680
people can share our uses and threat

639
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:56,839
descriptions so that we create a

640
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,069
community for sharing information with

641
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:03,500
this type of platforms you have an early

642
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:08,960
warning system in which every member of

643
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:10,610
the community can carry out previous

644
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,060
action based on what's happening to

645
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:16,670
other people in the specific case of

646
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:20,080
maze platform developed by an

647
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:24,670
institution in Luxembourg when you share

648
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:28,970
you can choose what you share in that

649
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:31,370
descriptor you create it so if you have

650
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:32,830
the descriptive and there's some details

651
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:35,600
you don't want to share with everybody

652
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,940
those details were not to be included in

653
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,870
the shared material you capture for

654
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:43,670
yourself but perhaps you don't want to

655
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:49,520
to explain the number of gi's as being

656
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:51,800
infected what's bad about not sharing

657
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,290
we're a little kids not share and adults

658
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,700
do not share either they don't share

659
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,500
everything they should because they

660
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,149
don't want to say that their network had

661
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:03,230
been infected

662
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:05,870
it's like saying I've been tricked and

663
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:08,870
people are not sharing everything they

664
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:11,710
should perhaps this was more a

665
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,710
theoretical

666
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:21,140
perhaps this is done at 60% 70% but I'm

667
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,570
not sharing everything I shoot sometimes

668
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,890
people do not share everything they

669
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:29,780
shared and in real life it's even worse

670
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:32,900
the idea of integrates integrating

671
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,540
sources as I've said before it allows us

672
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:40,670
to have the best Intel about the best

673
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:42,770
threat if you just have things from open

674
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:45,470
sources far away let's set right your

675
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:47,680
heart you'll be in trouble but you say

676
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:51,529
okay I have purchasing power enough to

677
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,109
pay a company to sell me feeds which is

678
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:56,420
information about threats ongoing threat

679
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,580
to their companies I cannot say the

680
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,650
names because I'm not paid for I'd

681
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,900
retire saying they're the biggest in the

682
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:07,850
market I have 20,000 30,000 clients

683
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:10,090
around the world and they have probes on

684
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:12,830
this client so instead of having a

685
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:15,170
sharing platform for free just for more

686
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:18,049
events for example they have corporate

687
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:21,680
banks clients and they sell you that

688
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:25,190
part you buy that part banking for

689
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,470
example and from Singapore to California

690
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:29,810
is everything that's happening in every

691
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:33,620
bank if any of them receives an impact

692
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:36,200
you have you're notified what a context

693
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:39,290
sometimes campaigns are focused on

694
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,950
Southeast Asia for example it's true

695
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:45,970
that most organizations have seats

696
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:49,370
around the world but it's true that

697
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:51,589
sometimes attacks are focused and South

698
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:54,770
Korea everybody thinks that the attacker

699
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:56,960
could be North Korea well North Korea if

700
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,670
they have no interests in Europe they're

701
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,130
not going to distribute the campaign

702
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,400
order to mitigate the possibility of

703
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:07,960
detection the more people you're hitting

704
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:14,710
well you'll be pointed out

705
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:19,480
fingers will be pointed at you for a big

706
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:23,349
bank they have shares or assets

707
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:26,200
everywhere around the world knowing that

708
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:30,940
its branches have been attacks in one

709
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:34,868
part of the world help the bank to take

710
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:37,839
action for example if it's being hit and

711
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:40,720
Asia it can take actions in Latin

712
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,270
America due to the different times they

713
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,669
can take mitigation actions for example

714
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:52,839
in the case of stock markets they depend

715
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:55,320
on the time and so on so they can gain

716
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:55,320
time

717
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:01,589
this is not for a second alysus once

718
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:04,079
it's over that's forensic analysis it

719
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:07,259
doesn't make sense you may have a lot of

720
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,479
money but you may have a lot of cars you

721
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:11,599
buy a garret such as Cristiano Ronaldo

722
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:14,549
so you have 12 cars on your garage

723
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,819
Butkus Tanner Ronaldo can only drive one

724
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:24,719
car at a time so 12 cars he can only

725
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:27,599
take one if we buy 5 6 7 providers half

726
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:30,089
our providers well I'm not going to say

727
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,909
this how smug but almost they all have

728
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:35,939
the same probes installed and they're

729
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:40,109
selling the same product to the final to

730
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:41,399
the end client so if you just have one

731
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:43,319
or two providers

732
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,459
there's no overlapping with the

733
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:51,839
information because if you have too many

734
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:53,729
providers you may have infox occasion

735
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,589
you may have too much information you

736
00:40:53,729 --> 00:40:59,308
cannot process it you don't have enough

737
00:40:55,589 --> 00:41:02,038
people and at some point you see that

738
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:05,279
they're overlapping they're setting the

739
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:07,349
same eye you see several times the

740
00:41:05,279 --> 00:41:12,209
normal thing in organizations is not

741
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:15,559
having one or two source providers and

742
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:18,029
you combine that with yours

743
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:20,989
with internal information entire

744
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:23,429
information gives more value to the

745
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:25,529
organization but external information in

746
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:29,779
the case of banking they shouldn't be

747
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:34,549
ignored because they could be put into a

748
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:34,549
context with your business environment

749
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:44,720
now we're going to move to a more

750
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:47,720
technical part when you start to

751
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,910
received a lot of more samples and you

752
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:57,819
need to analyze them what you want is

753
00:41:51,910 --> 00:42:00,109
serializing who could be behind this and

754
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:02,509
this is going to be included in a

755
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:06,348
campaign and that campaign is going to

756
00:42:02,509 --> 00:42:08,749
be organized by someone once you analyze

757
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:11,239
a bag and you don't know what it is you

758
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:14,390
don't know where it comes from but when

759
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:16,999
you see the mo what's doing if it's

760
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:20,239
through the email or not you can have an

761
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:23,209
idea of what's going on so you want to

762
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:29,660
try to serialize this type of actions to

763
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:31,640
have a context for your threat if we

764
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:35,538
manage to find the connections between

765
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:39,339
the samples this is like the film's you

766
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:43,119
find a signature that says something

767
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:43,119
what are you going to find

768
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:55,049
is a pattern some patterns because they

769
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:58,890
use some programming techniques or

770
00:42:55,049 --> 00:43:00,719
attack techniques that make you think

771
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:06,558
that it's the same group or the same

772
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:09,239
person if you find that the end you say

773
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:12,059
this comes from the same person of group

774
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:15,269
of people but what they're doing is

775
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:19,019
every 24 48 hours they generally near

776
00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:21,328
some poke with the little difference so

777
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:26,488
that pari-mutuel defenses cannot detect

778
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:28,829
it because they usually look signature

779
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:31,939
and very little if behavior usually

780
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:34,679
behavior is not that easy to detect

781
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:37,469
once you've characterized the sample and

782
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,089
everything it does you say okay it can

783
00:43:37,469 --> 00:43:41,809
belong to the same group of people

784
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:43,949
they've reused code that was available

785
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:46,979
added up web and other colleagues

786
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:49,559
working there analyzing networks have

787
00:43:46,979 --> 00:43:53,910
detected it that information you're

788
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:56,260
saying it's specific but actually you

789
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:59,089
can buy the modules

790
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:02,050
and you cannot attribute it everything

791
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:06,259
that's available in the black market

792
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:07,880
cannot be easily attributed because you

793
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:15,310
just have to pay for it and depending on

794
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:15,310
the cost that without you oh good buy it

795
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,529
there are new methods that allow us to

796
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:26,230
the representation of big data we have

797
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:28,270
thousands of samples in a personal

798
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,950
collection and you can create cool

799
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,220
drawing such as this one

800
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:37,569
what does mean this is from a real

801
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:43,779
campaign apt one you have three samples

802
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:50,200
to analyze and that Dominions jump every

803
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:54,340
24 40 24 48 hours they change we see the

804
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:57,009
use common Dominion controllers and we

805
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,990
can conclude with a real possibility of

806
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:02,520
being wrong the three samples have been

807
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:02,520
developed by the same group of people

808
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:09,870
instead of doing this with three samples

809
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,730
we do this with 30,000 we don't do this

810
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:16,700
merrily this I do it manually but not

811
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:18,840
this thing we do it with an IT

812
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:27,169
application that allows you to generate

813
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:29,880
graphs you apply this to your sample

814
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:31,290
group and it allows you to say that this

815
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,250
comes from the same a group of people

816
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:36,990
with two different campaigns this square

817
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:40,370
graph is one campaign and the circle is

818
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:43,379
another one but they are the same agent

819
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:47,190
the Integra Nation to connection between

820
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:49,290
this node is the faces of this and for

821
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,900
you to know how the graph was generated

822
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:54,480
based on the minim controllers they have

823
00:45:51,900 --> 00:46:00,360
in common we could generate these graphs

824
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:04,190
the apple once connected to ones and the

825
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,190
ones at the bottom to others

826
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,890
you have a code a complete code the

827
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,750
initial sample for example and you see

828
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:17,290
there are functions you analyze it with

829
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:20,970
Ida and you see parts of it which sound

830
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:23,560
familiar you analyze it and you see how

831
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:30,970
do you say well this was bought this is

832
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:35,529
you if you don't want to be detected one

833
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:39,660
of the techniques is used using Windows

834
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:42,310
bugs that a Windows API use if I use

835
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:45,330
something which is personal if I get

836
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:48,820
caught if the list comes to my place and

837
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:52,029
found the code in my computer I think

838
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:55,480
I'm going to get caught but if I use the

839
00:46:52,030 --> 00:47:00,130
windows I'm not going to get caught it's

840
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:04,060
still so based and code fragments which

841
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:06,010
are different you can find ways to find

842
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:09,369
similarities for example the order

843
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:13,330
functions are called there are different

844
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:16,480
tricks to configure the percentage of

845
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:19,859
code that is similar attackers want to

846
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,859
maximize the win

847
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:24,910
if they are using spoon victims they're

848
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:28,839
going to change four lines of their code

849
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:31,240
so that in maximum one hour or twenty

850
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:33,009
minutes they have a sample which is

851
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,290
completely different and they start a

852
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:39,160
new distribution campaign if you need to

853
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:41,970
reprogram everything you know how long

854
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:44,710
it takes to do one of this thing it

855
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:46,359
doesn't make sense because your man hour

856
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:47,440
is going to be more expensive that the

857
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:49,720
profit you're going to make with their

858
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,210
campaign so there are samples with a

859
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:54,580
high percentage of similarity and others

860
00:47:52,210 --> 00:48:00,900
with a smaller percentage as I've said

861
00:47:54,580 --> 00:48:06,930
before we there are models and the most

862
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:11,609
frequent is the one based in anagrams

863
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:14,160
we'll finish the presentation with this

864
00:48:11,609 --> 00:48:16,680
and this allows us to see coincidences

865
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,649
between our matches between samples

866
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,348
we've analyzed a sample we characterize

867
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:26,130
it with all these little points that

868
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:33,660
will be the IOC's we've configured and B

869
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:36,209
sample has these dots we draw Venn

870
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:38,430
diagram and there's a coincidence that

871
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:43,078
two samples have elements in common

872
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:45,089
if we do mathematical calculations that

873
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,309
we consider reliable with create a

874
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:50,219
function that allows us to analyze these

875
00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:54,420
we can establish the similarity degree

876
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:57,660
between these two functions their

877
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:59,630
functions allow you to have to make this

878
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:03,200
comparisons and you obtain the

879
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:03,200
similarity percentage

880
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:15,950
the similarity is represented as a

881
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:17,660
percentage for co2 sent 200 this is

882
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:19,970
useful to explain things to your boss

883
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:22,430
and with the jacquard in text as the one

884
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:24,770
I've used for my presentation if this

885
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:26,810
fulfills complies with the three

886
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:28,520
characteristics you need a normalized

887
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,290
value you need to understand how it

888
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,780
works so that you can explain it and you

889
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:35,000
can empirically verify that it works you

890
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:39,140
need to validate your method this is a

891
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,890
paper you present it and it's your own

892
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,700
method

893
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:46,359
jacquard index is very good there's

894
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,359
another graph

895
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:55,430
which is an example of years of jacquard

896
00:49:53,390 --> 00:50:00,259
in text if there's no similarity this

897
00:49:55,430 --> 00:50:03,740
vpv upper left square nothing to do now

898
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:05,240
I see in common they have been haven't

899
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,370
been made by the same person or a

900
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:10,870
different comparing or they change the

901
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:13,250
mo and the second there's the full match

902
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:17,660
between I you see if you haven't

903
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:20,360
established hush as I you see it would

904
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:23,420
be the same sample that other ways

905
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:27,620
besides the hash to establish I you see

906
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:31,030
so here the IOC is reliable it sure that

907
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:35,839
it was made by the same person and then

908
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:38,750
bottom left just one common IOC it's not

909
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,530
probably it was not probably done by the

910
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:45,860
same person

911
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:47,570
there's very little in common I never

912
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,950
using the same technique but it'll

913
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:50,990
probably use the same function but that

914
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:53,290
doesn't prove it the same person there

915
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:57,500
just isn't the same method and then a

916
00:50:53,290 --> 00:51:02,660
bottom right you have four matches out

917
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:07,100
of 10 so 40% say maybe maybe not usually

918
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:10,339
according to jacquard index you you said

919
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:13,600
when there's a two percent match you can

920
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,600
represent it in a table

921
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,540
this is similar to what explains with

922
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:28,420
regard to the winter how to represent

923
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:28,420
the threat this is huge

924
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:36,980
separate campaigns from the same agent

925
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:39,650
samples received in apt one and this

926
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:44,170
proves this shows the different

927
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:44,170
campaigns in a very easy way

928
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:53,219
so I've already gone the last part when

929
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:57,899
we're gonna see the presentation I just

930
00:51:53,219 --> 00:52:02,910
go to show the slides about mix it

931
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:06,599
allows you to identify the threat the

932
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:09,509
agent the indicators they campaigns if

933
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:13,920
you follow this graph you can define

934
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:18,690
who's doing what you can analyze the

935
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,729
campaign States in the taxi as protocols

936
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:22,559
in order to define and exchange

937
00:52:20,729 --> 00:52:26,430
information and this is the last panel

938
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,930
they've developed so you can see how

939
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:30,239
complex this is you may think this is

940
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:33,118
simple but filling all these saying is

941
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:35,819
takes a while sometimes it takes longer

942
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,829
than the campaign itself but you have a

943
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:40,499
history of campaigns the campaign

944
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:43,380
history so you see what we saw a couple

945
00:52:40,499 --> 00:52:45,238
of slides before you can analyze the

946
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:49,680
similarities between them it's not the

947
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:52,499
only option we have cortex has a lot of

948
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:56,430
ways now to characterize threats it he

949
00:52:52,499 --> 00:52:58,558
uses color code graphic panel and this

950
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:01,019
was my presentation we have a little bit

951
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:11,839
of time for Q&A I hope you liked my

952
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:11,839
presentation good morning

953
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:19,770
the state has abilities to prevent to

954
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:23,910
mitigate this type of attacks and with

955
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:31,830
all that why don't you do it like white

956
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:35,569
hats a vector of noise protects our

957
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:39,119
domestic routers and there are failures

958
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:43,349
known failure that could be mitigated by

959
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:47,820
the state like some white hats they've

960
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:53,869
created a punch regardless of the will

961
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:53,869
of the router user instead of waiting

962
00:53:54,760 --> 00:54:01,580
for someone to use this router to attack

963
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:03,590
and make noise in to the network and

964
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:08,029
making people's work more difficult why

965
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:12,080
doesn't the state take a role as a white

966
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:16,370
hat and execute things itself lack of

967
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:18,350
budget I think it's a perfect answer at

968
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:20,330
the end of the day human resources and

969
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:23,960
economic resources are limited in three

970
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:26,210
way that organizes this event I guess an

971
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:29,660
in very short time they'll have the

972
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:32,030
responsibility of doing that in Spain it

973
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:33,830
wouldn't be the army it will be in

974
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:38,710
theory the one in charge of citizens

975
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:38,710
security second question is it possible

976
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:43,370
the attacker is the attacked are two

977
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:47,720
sides of the same coin

978
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:50,839
Spain sells weapons to Arabia to attack

979
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:55,730
Yemen so somehow they're looking for

980
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:59,000
that to turn against himself how the

981
00:54:55,730 --> 00:55:01,670
state of the army considered considers

982
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,590
this type of issue where you have an

983
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:05,980
attacker and attacked could you please

984
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:05,980
repeat the question

985
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:19,279
Spain is calmly selling weapons to write

986
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:25,179
Arabia to attack Yemen it's been in but

987
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:25,179
we attack Spain we said their terror

988
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:33,810
a terrorist how is the army working with

989
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:39,000
this - food mentality I am NOT allowed

990
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:52,500
to answer to that question other

991
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:55,550
question which is technical hello thank

992
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,550
you for your presentation

993
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:08,080
when the last markets were closing

994
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:11,230
darknet in the dark what other types of

995
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:25,210
communication are you saying

996
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:29,020
the criminal about the trends among

997
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:31,360
cyber criminals in the dark web they

998
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:33,580
change the methods usually threat

999
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:36,580
threats evolve and you need to follow

1000
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:39,250
the evolution of a threat so information

1001
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:42,460
is not static its dynamic they change

1002
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:45,100
their parameters so they have a trend

1003
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:48,760
and they see that you're stopping them

1004
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:51,430
they change the tactics so it's always

1005
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,290
easier attacking than defending with you

1006
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:56,049
how can you have the initiative and you

1007
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:58,480
have to react doesn't matter how much

1008
00:56:56,050 --> 00:57:02,320
information you can gather in advance

1009
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:04,270
they say well when this is fashionable

1010
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,390
we attacked Windows Android we attack

1011
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:09,660
Android they've implemented a patch for

1012
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:12,940
this well let's go for something else

1013
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:15,149
there was a step ahead and they work

1014
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,470
with information about a known

1015
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:19,570
vulnerabilities someone that creates

1016
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:21,700
exploits you have to pay attention to

1017
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:25,030
that they're not static a static attack

1018
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:27,759
today will would not make sense because

1019
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:32,230
they're patched very quickly so they

1020
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,360
evolve and then the ones the cleverest

1021
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:36,280
ones don't publish things in the dark

1022
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:41,260
way the lack of talent that even states

1023
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:43,120
have make the meleave trucks in the dark

1024
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:45,660
web you can pick up this little things

1025
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:48,790
and have an idea about what's coming but

1026
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:50,500
only your lives and when you I see we've

1027
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:53,830
seen with the graph they already inside

1028
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:55,570
and you have to analyze SSR work as four

1029
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:57,960
and six you have we have to see what's

1030
00:57:55,570 --> 00:58:00,370
happened any other question

1031
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:04,560
well thank you very much

1032
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:04,560
[Applause]

1033
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,370
you
