00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,560
you

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:13,280
[Music]

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:16,369
get that one of the RS they know good

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,130
morning we're back again with our second

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:22,790
workshop today we're going to be hearing

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:25,609
from Manuel Lopez Rivera he's here on

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:32,058
behalf of the forints he's a forensic

9
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:35,809
analyst from the central cyber crime

10
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:38,089
unit at the Spanish police he's going to

11
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:40,989
tell us about IOT forensic a warm round

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,989
of applause for him

13
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:48,710
good morning everyone

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,059
I'm back again and I'm saying I'm back

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,100
again because this is my second

16
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,218
presentation I was in the other room

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,910
earlier on so I'm here to tell you today

18
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:01,789
about IOT forensic what does that mean

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:04,670
well device is connecting up to the

20
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:05,239
Internet and then doing things my name

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:12,289
is Maya

22
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:14,720
Manuel Guerra I am a forensic expert for

23
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:17,930
the Spanish police and I have a master's

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,960
on cyber no cyber crime cybersecurity

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:25,549
I'm in at an editor of a blog where I

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,009
talk about what to do with different

27
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,520
devices you can also follow me on

28
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:36,560
twitter i'm sarah cyber police that's my

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,470
username on twitter so why am i

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,220
interested in the internet of things a

31
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:46,939
design side of forensic science but last

32
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:51,170
year I was also talking about forensic

33
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:54,589
analysis on what's up that was the name

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,630
of my workshop last year most of us use

35
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:03,020
what's up with our mobile phones this

36
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:06,259
application it probably means that cyber

37
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,109
criminals are going to be checking and

38
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:14,020
using

39
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,460
those possibilities on what's up so I'm

40
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,590
going to be telling you about things

41
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:22,720
that you could all use plus this year

42
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,180
connected with the Internet of Things

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,930
that means devices connecting up to the

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:33,120
Internet and doing physical operations

45
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:37,390
and activities is IOT growth going to be

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,250
exponential linear or what oh I have no

47
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,630
idea but I do know that there will be

48
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:47,620
more and more devices as time goes by in

49
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,750
the world in general at home connected

50
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,110
devices connected to the Internet so

51
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:56,670
that's why we need to know how to do a

52
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:00,700
forensic analysis of these devices

53
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,799
finding digital evidence like we used to

54
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,640
do in the past and we still have to do

55
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,410
from for instance a hard drive well in

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,779
the future it will be more and more as

57
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:15,640
accessing that information say from a

58
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:18,430
smart switch so I want my presentation

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,570
to think about the future of concerns

60
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:25,120
that might be concerns now or just for

61
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,890
the future when we talk about the

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,060
Internet of Things are we talking about

63
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:34,149
the future or is it here and now the

64
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:37,180
Internet of Things or drones I bet

65
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:41,070
you've read a news like this a drone

66
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:45,340
attacking a president or a statesman

67
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:50,620
drones transporting drugs and just

68
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:55,150
dropping drugs wherever or during the

69
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:59,230
Spanish cycling tour some of my

70
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:02,560
colleagues had to avoid drones flying

71
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:07,238
over cyclists during the competition and

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,850
endangering either cyclists or their

73
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,130
followers so we're not talking about the

74
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,739
future and we're talking about here and

75
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:18,570
now we need to have countermeasures so

76
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:20,620
that we can avoid an attack from at

77
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,300
this is a SmartWatch

78
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,090
can you raise your hand if you've got a

79
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,449
SmartWatch what there you go

80
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:32,169
a SmartWatch is a watch but not like

81
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:38,220
mine I have an analog watch it has your

82
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:42,940
heartbeat your heart rate or the sat-nav

83
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:45,580
positioning so that I can also see my

84
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,860
whatsapp messages or my Twitter messages

85
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,380
on my SmartWatch rather than using my

86
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,710
mobile phone you can do that right so

87
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:58,870
imagine there is a homicide and the

88
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:02,320
victim we found the victim dead with a

89
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,650
SmartWatch well that can tell us what

90
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:10,479
time his or her heartbeat stop heart

91
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:14,530
stopped beating in the time that person

92
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,440
died plus the sat-nav system it can tell

93
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,080
us where that the victim was just before

94
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,260
the crime or just other time of a crime

95
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,800
so in this case that we can see up on

96
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:30,639
the screen this lady had an alibi she

97
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:34,389
had been accused as the criminal hood

98
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:37,690
murdered the victim and thanks to her

99
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:43,050
Smart Watch a we managed to prove it was

100
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:48,880
her she was there and then what about IP

101
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:52,360
cameras security systems they have

102
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:57,940
cameras like this like both what we can

103
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,260
see up on the screen and cameras that

104
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,530
can

105
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,260
work and be controlled wherever you are

106
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:09,580
in the world but one of these cameras

107
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,510
are connected for 24 hours daily seven

108
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,909
days a week

109
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:21,760
well we could end up with this situation

110
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:24,070
the Mirai botanist in that case where

111
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,180
these IP cameras have not been

112
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:31,780
configured properly and there was a huge

113
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,300
problem not so long ago I was shopping

114
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,969
for cameras a to prepare a presentation

115
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:45,840
and I found that one of these cameras in

116
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:50,980
Spain shoda was there was a situation

117
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:56,229
where the baby was in its course with a

118
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:59,830
camera recording the baby why well the

119
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:01,840
parents went to a shopping center so

120
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,669
they could control their baby from their

121
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,580
mobile phones whatever whatever they

122
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:09,310
were unfortunately they didn't set it

123
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,609
right so it wasn't just them watching

124
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:16,810
the baby but rather the whole wide world

125
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:22,810
being able to watch the baby in it in

126
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:26,100
its cot fortunately the parents found

127
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:30,780
out and they stopped that from happening

128
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:33,940
huh those are problems that weekend or

129
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,280
situations that we can find because of

130
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,660
the Internet of Things this is another

131
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:46,090
case where a forensic analysis of a

132
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:49,630
Rooter helped find out if the murderer

133
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:52,630
had been where he was supposed to be

134
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:56,730
where he said he was we can also have

135
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,730
Smart TVs for instance

136
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:07,409
sitting room at home or in a bedroom a

137
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:11,430
smart TV and we can program it to play

138
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:14,969
whatever we want plus TVs Smart TVs

139
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,879
often come with their webcam and I might

140
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:20,849
be watching a film or I might be

141
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:24,180
somewhere else but somebody can know

142
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:27,919
then if I'm at home or not I'm where I

143
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:32,190
am on what doing what about smart

144
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:37,708
refrigerators that tell us in good time

145
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:41,729
if we need to if we need more milk and

146
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:42,958
they do the shopping themselves they

147
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,310
place the order

148
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:52,170
well once again that's another niche for

149
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:57,319
criminals to hack the smart refrigerator

150
00:08:52,170 --> 00:09:00,420
and get your bank card details sometimes

151
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,850
in hotels that's what I've seen so far

152
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,689
not at homes you might go to the

153
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,430
bathroom and the mirror greets you and

154
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,160
tells me for instance hey man oh you're

155
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,709
looking good this morning today you

156
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,969
would be looking good in this with this

157
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:21,569
shirt and these trousers the webcam on

158
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:25,560
the mirror showing you that or playing

159
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:27,930
the news on TV that's lovely right but

160
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,420
what about if that smart mirror is

161
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:35,790
hacked well that can be quite nasty

162
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:39,180
right also smart mirrors sometimes need

163
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:44,870
to be connected to the Wi-Fi network at

164
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:49,260
the hotel the SSH is running imagine and

165
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:54,839
with a very silly password like 1 2 3 4

166
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:57,990
5 6 so if I'm in that hotel room and I

167
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,569
just happened to find that the password

168
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:05,130
AI can gain control of that webcam and

169
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:06,780
record all sorts of things those are

170
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,020
dangerous and has

171
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,839
it's that IOT it brings with it and I'm

172
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:17,120
not demonizing it I'm just warning you

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:21,360
or for a smart bathrooms and toilets

174
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,390
where the temperature the water pressure

175
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,050
everything can be programmed hacker can

176
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:30,930
be can have great fun with us can you

177
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:34,709
imagine so I'm not going to keep telling

178
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:37,199
you giving you more examples why it

179
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:41,490
makes sense now here are now talking

180
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:45,990
about IOT forensic so why did I think of

181
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,420
preparing this presentation sorry one of

182
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,520
the pictures didn't show very well up on

183
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,780
the screen and I do want you to see it

184
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,780
it's important

185
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:11,870
my presentation today started thanks to

186
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:16,459
Oscar nominated at the weekend at home I

187
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:23,180
organized a barbecue once and I had a

188
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:26,359
smart plug or socket and we thought hey

189
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,758
shall we try a case well in just 15

190
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,589
minutes we came to control to this

191
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:36,290
system so I want to acknowledge a Oscar

192
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:40,100
for giving me this great idea for my

193
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:46,370
presentation today I want to show this

194
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:47,839
now on PDF there it is let me just

195
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,170
remind you that there is not one

196
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:55,100
specific protocol for IOT forensic

197
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:57,979
analysis it's so new so it's down to

198
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,250
lateral thinking and common sense and

199
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:05,870
creativity of the analyst and then

200
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:09,709
customized for every device or system so

201
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,930
I'm going to be telling you today about

202
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:15,729
different devices and different

203
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:17,920
possibilities adapted to each situation

204
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,680
because depending on the thermal

205
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:26,029
signature a particular device might need

206
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,880
different approaches in different

207
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:32,269
situations we need to always apply the

208
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,660
least invasive method possible we will

209
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:38,779
see how and why later less invasive less

210
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,829
destructive and also recording all the

211
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:46,040
tasks we carry out this is my disclaimer

212
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:48,199
and now I want to remind you that an IOT

213
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:53,500
device is a little bit like a mobile

214
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:53,500
phone we can only gain information

215
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:02,319
always if we have permission to do so

216
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:05,899
because otherwise it would be a crime

217
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:13,100
and you might end up in prison

218
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:15,649
served pasta in your prison cell so

219
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,779
during my presentations I am going to

220
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:21,019
show you different gadgets and devices

221
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,389
to see how you could analyze each one

222
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:27,350
let's start with the first one a drone a

223
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:30,350
normal drone that can be used for very

224
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:34,759
nasty things and I'm sure that you know

225
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:37,370
how and you know that about that what's

226
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:41,329
the main problem with this device and

227
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:44,209
other IOT devices the hardest part is

228
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:50,769
accessing the information the internal

229
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:57,500
memory because in a laptop or a pendrive

230
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:59,930
device that's much easier not in an IOT

231
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,180
device you need to access the device in

232
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,349
a different way and that's why I said

233
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:09,800
you need to be creative and imaginative

234
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:12,199
so finding that look that picture will

235
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:18,560
only be possible if you are imagine a

236
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:22,370
different when I say I want to talk

237
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,219
about drones I'm not talking about a toy

238
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,579
drone because they don't save

239
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,699
information rather I'm talking about

240
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:33,969
more professional more expensive drones

241
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:37,550
with certain more complex

242
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:41,089
infrastructures what's the main problem

243
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:44,389
with drones with these higher range

244
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:47,750
drones they need a database with an

245
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:51,280
exclusion area with exclusion areas for

246
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:54,040
instance if I want to fly my drone near

247
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,250
an airport he won't let me because it

248
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,520
has that as an exclusion area on his

249
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:03,180
sat-nav information that means drones

250
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:08,730
need to keep updating that because

251
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,729
exclusion areas might change and then

252
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:18,730
flying will not work what's good about

253
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,550
that well a drone needs to connect up to

254
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,160
the internet s for updates to work and

255
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:27,250
also it should have a sat-nav system as

256
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,550
GPS system for that to work so

257
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:34,300
indirectly that means that we can tell

258
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,040
where the drone has been if we can

259
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,910
access that database with that

260
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:43,000
information this is my first example

261
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:47,170
because I don't I think reinventing the

262
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:52,180
wheel is very very unnecessary so we

263
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:56,229
have a you F touch or you FPC different

264
00:15:52,180 --> 00:16:00,010
systems that our drone compatible all

265
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:02,680
you do is plug in your phone into this

266
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:05,650
system and I don't need to think about

267
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:11,709
the SD card cell and memory nothing like

268
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:15,189
that for forensic analysis although this

269
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:18,640
is not always possible if we will see

270
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:21,700
why later how you can access what

271
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:27,910
information here we see three different

272
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:31,540
types of drones in spire 2 maphack Pro

273
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:33,699
and phantom 3 so I would have the

274
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:37,599
control installed

275
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:40,320
I would then connect it to a USB and I

276
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,780
could access that information and

277
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,570
there's person passing in these

278
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:52,180
applications normally so that I can tell

279
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:55,210
about the altitude the if the drone has

280
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:58,000
been taking pictures or recording videos

281
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:01,019
that's very useful right and it works

282
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,199
with these three very well-known more

283
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:09,319
now phantom4 is a little bit more

284
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:13,169
complex which costs around about 3,400

285
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:16,168
3,500 euros this is a different

286
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:19,380
situation because access cannot be

287
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:24,480
gained through the USB USB port but

288
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:27,059
rather through the two micro SD cards

289
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,960
it has why does it have them because

290
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:35,129
they save pictures and videos so if the

291
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:38,190
drone is told to record videos or

292
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:45,690
pictures that's stored on the micro SD

293
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:51,659
card so I get the micro SD card and you

294
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:55,440
can do so you then block again against

295
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:58,919
writing before I analyze why because I

296
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,950
am not supposed to change the contents

297
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:05,730
of the cart logically so forensically

298
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:09,299
speaking and then the second micro SD

299
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:13,770
card here you need to remove the housing

300
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:17,070
first so you can get the card so don't

301
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:21,270
think this is terribly difficult for

302
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:25,020
instance if you want to access hard disk

303
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:28,049
or them laptop for instance you would

304
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,789
have to do exactly the same thing the

305
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:31,470
resolution is not very good for that

306
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:33,740
picture right you can't see that very

307
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,740
well

308
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:39,809
see there's one turmoil okay slapping

309
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,409
that is wrong

310
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:47,490
nothing control so if we disassemblies

311
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:52,080
you find that motherboard which contains

312
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:54,960
the micro SD card so once I get it I can

313
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,830
analyze the contents and what contents

314
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:03,950
are those what is telemetric information

315
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,949
where it was the flying speed

316
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:16,039
this and so on there's another way for

317
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:20,510
me to analyze a drone which is through

318
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:27,399
the Wi-Fi well basically a drone is a

319
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:30,529
linux with internet and blades right so

320
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:34,610
let's imagine this is like a Linux

321
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:37,309
operating system in phantom 4 there's

322
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:42,529
something quite peculiar communication

323
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:47,570
happens through Wi-Fi with access points

324
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:51,919
being activated with this device with

325
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:54,080
this pineapple because it's more

326
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,690
powerful than the control it means that

327
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,408
communications could could go through

328
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:05,390
this device because the SSH has is

329
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:07,039
working we access with route 1 9 what we

330
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:13,159
can see is out up on the screen the

331
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:16,220
password ssh route as 192 168 1 2 we can

332
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:18,860
then through Wi-Fi access all that

333
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:23,120
information through about telemetrics

334
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:27,199
and so on because drones are not just a

335
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:30,918
drone is the drone plus the control plus

336
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:35,120
the smartphone needed for that so we we

337
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:38,240
need to analyze all three devices ok

338
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:44,330
this the micro SD card on the drone also

339
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:46,100
the applications about the flight on the

340
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:49,070
mobile phone and the same thing for the

341
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,840
remote control right this is getting a

342
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,379
little bit more interesting this is a

343
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,209
smart palak I was going to bring the

344
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,159
drone and show you but I thought it

345
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,220
would be a bit dangerous at flying the

346
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,799
drone better not yes so the smart blog

347
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,350
is a little bit less dangerous right I

348
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:10,220
can just get a bit of an electrical

349
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:12,760
shock at worst how does this device work

350
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,210
I plug it in

351
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:20,410
into a circus and then through my mobile

352
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:24,340
phone I tell it to turn itself on or off

353
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:28,480
my mobile phone sends the command to the

354
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:31,540
cloud and the then from there to the

355
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,420
smart block again so my mother phone is

356
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,120
not ever connecting up to the smartphone

357
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,490
plug is mobile phone to the cloud and

358
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,409
then cloud to the smart clock please

359
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,690
bear that in mind when you do your

360
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,760
forensic analysis this is the

361
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,680
application just showing you how the

362
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,680
button looks what what it looks like

363
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:55,510
when it's on or off and I've brought you

364
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:58,960
a demo just for you to see how analysis

365
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:03,160
can be done for this type of device what

366
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,450
you do with it this is a new early IOT

367
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:10,240
device I just bought it

368
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:12,670
round the corner as you can see I've

369
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:17,310
indulge in every expense some people

370
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:22,630
might say this looks like Sun and like

371
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:32,169
Santa but it is now Santa why is it

372
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:33,030
smart because I will make it small let

373
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,700
me

374
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:37,300
like every device usually I'd like risk

375
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,660
in it

376
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,520
I have no video my demo is real it

377
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:46,540
doesn't work doesn't work if it works it

378
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:51,780
will so we are here to just risk it all

379
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,780
cause this is starts

380
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:22,970
but as you see here a securities well

381
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,970
tied under control

382
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:43,830
so probably you've noticed my password

383
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:46,340
policy which is a posted underneath no

384
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,340
problem here

385
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,360
so it's almost ready

386
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:33,179
let me take the datasheet for this

387
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:33,179
little Center yellow and black

388
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:49,750
in the first round your row you're quite

389
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,750
brave aren't you you're trusting me here

390
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,530
can not

391
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,330
well nothing will happen I don't know

392
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:10,379
about you but I'll be safe maybe you

393
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:16,169
know what you want all right so I'll

394
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:20,850
explain all the prepping here so what we

395
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:23,070
have here is quite a mess but apart from

396
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:26,280
a mess we have a cellphone that is

397
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:29,220
sending on Wi-Fi and it is a Wi-Fi

398
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,920
access point on the pineapple which is

399
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,380
connected to the Wi-Fi access point at

400
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,020
its sources and in another Wi-Fi on

401
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:42,080
which we have connected this smart like

402
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:46,860
and a second cell phone that will be our

403
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,470
victim's fan from my victims phone I

404
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:54,570
once sent a command to the smart black

405
00:25:49,470 --> 00:26:10,260
for HC turn on and it does did you hear

406
00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:13,260
the click so it enough on so you just

407
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:18,900
came here to see me click a button and

408
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:21,030
turn on incentive this is not IOT yes a

409
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,320
push a pattern the design you're gonna

410
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:28,290
leave if you want all right

411
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,669
lead scared last year you found us it

412
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,280
would we've done right every

413
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:35,160
communication from the center to the

414
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,960
smartphone and to the phone go through

415
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,150
the pineapple right there's the Wi-Fi

416
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,380
device I will try to intercept those

417
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:44,850
communications and see what information

418
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:46,710
goes through through that network these

419
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,860
in turn will help us understand were the

420
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:52,920
server's of the device are and see what

421
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:57,770
IP is their login until so I say what

422
00:26:52,920 --> 00:27:00,770
there is man we were not so first on TV

423
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,770
pineapple

424
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:21,639
my question was too good so I have this

425
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:31,178
SSH connection to the pineapple and I

426
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:32,918
will have the F P damp point this way we

427
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:36,249
intercept the any communication between

428
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:39,909
the pineapple and the device the various

429
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:42,210
State so let me set a target the single

430
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:46,659
target here

431
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:50,230
that's the phone's so this IP is the IP

432
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:53,499
that their phone has so it will only get

433
00:27:50,230 --> 00:28:01,840
the package from the packet from the

434
00:27:53,499 --> 00:28:04,269
phone so it starts working but that's

435
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,689
where you see all the frames that it is

436
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:13,210
capturing that it is getting good isn't

437
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:16,980
it you know every expense here so we see

438
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:21,009
all the information that this cellphone

439
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:24,700
sendin up to the cloud so that we can

440
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:27,489
control this intelligent flag this is

441
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,919
mark black so this sends information to

442
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:32,830
the cloud and then week at it on the

443
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,779
smart flag black from the cloud there

444
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,899
are some frames where it says Amazon

445
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:41,169
this is an amazon's cloud on AWS boughs

446
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:42,908
was the manufacturer is running the

447
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:44,950
black so the manufacturers decide the

448
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:47,789
whole infrastructure or whatever is an

449
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,799
amazon's cloud Amazon's web services

450
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:52,509
that's data right a business may attempt

451
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:57,009
so we know this is a smart phone is

452
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:58,840
using Amazon now I will not do it but

453
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:02,080
it's just running a command but I have

454
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,230
one here from the other day and we open

455
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,230
it

456
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:26,030
these are the conversations on the phone

457
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:29,550
and we T we see three IPS 34 52 and 203

458
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:32,670
these are the ones used by the phone the

459
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:35,010
whole time I checked on right for their

460
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,200
first one is Amazon we can see that

461
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:40,290
second one is Amazon as well

462
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,550
I've already advanced that and the third

463
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,550
one see were where is it from

464
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:56,490
Alibaba China it's not that we have a

465
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:58,740
smart plug that has been Trojan no it's

466
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,780
the cellphone that it's Trojans and it's

467
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,880
doing control from China I have it for

468
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,260
testing and there's a back in there that

469
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,380
installed still in there so probably

470
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,129
Chinese people are listening and in now

471
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,710
as we speak

472
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:14,100
Thank You Byron and that's why we've got

473
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:16,200
China's IP so these ways not that we

474
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:18,689
know that is not being controlled

475
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,630
remotely but we can actually have the

476
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,550
cellphone and see if things if they're

477
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,660
doing things they shouldn't but I have

478
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:27,629
it ready for it

479
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:41,100
so this is out of the scope of IOT is a

480
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:46,260
workshop so back to what Wireshark so we

481
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:49,169
see the DNS domain for these IOT IOT

482
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:52,830
mirrors dot-com so we know what this is

483
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:56,250
if this OH IOT device is not trilliant

484
00:30:52,830 --> 00:31:02,340
it has to go into IOT MERIS dot-com and

485
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:06,000
the IP IPS 52 and 34 same as before so

486
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:08,159
this device as it seems it's nothing

487
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,650
weird about it we need to know because

488
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,600
if we want to know whether a device is

489
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,060
under remote control for an illegal

490
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:21,060
activity we really need to know where it

491
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:23,450
was connected same here no no we're

492
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,450
weird

493
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:32,658
all right second half of today's seminar

494
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:36,440
would be looking into the installation a

495
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:40,580
PP we've checked the traffic and now we

496
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,740
will check the apk for the setup so what

497
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,860
I done was from the manufacturers you

498
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,139
have remote control of it naturally we

499
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:50,809
download it and we calculate as a

500
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:52,729
digital signature to make sure that's

501
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:56,059
what we are looking for and not

502
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:57,230
something else ap get somewhere around

503
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:00,590
here here it is

504
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:05,080
this is a typical file which is apk and

505
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:08,779
this is Android so we can decompile it

506
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:16,070
so we could we I have D compiled it

507
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:20,059
already so we take the hop that have and

508
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:29,299
we get here this is the inside of the

509
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:38,200
apk so we go into the dot-com and we go

510
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:38,200
into MERIS here it is again mirrors

511
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,860
you

512
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:44,280
mr. prosecutor was terribly no is so

513
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,130
what we see here is just the same we

514
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:52,590
seen before

515
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:58,170
t domain it is logging on to and in AWS

516
00:33:52,590 --> 00:34:01,909
that is Amazon server this way this way

517
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:05,400
we know that the setup app has not been

518
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:09,110
Trojans or has is not on the fraudulent

519
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:11,790
control this is some more information

520
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:14,820
with which we know this are your team

521
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:29,130
there's a smart flight device and has no

522
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:33,990
trouble whatsoever and so these IOT

523
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:36,240
device housing processes running in the

524
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:41,100
background so let's look what's going

525
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:44,428
what's running on the smart clock so

526
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:51,330
nmap against the IP and we'll see there

527
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:55,620
are some services live 2380 etc so there

528
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:58,980
is a telnet still running so for a IOT

529
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:02,549
device that is at least dangers because

530
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,860
if we try to go onto the telnet we might

531
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:07,590
be surprised

532
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:11,850
first let's check port 80 which is a

533
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:15,140
regular ordinary web port we type the IP

534
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:18,569
address and there's a failure there

535
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,549
there's something open but nothing

536
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:23,940
running and if we look for directories

537
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:28,440
we find this it seems that admin HT BM

538
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:31,590
and firmware IH t M those paths allowed

539
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,210
us to change the password and update the

540
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:35,880
firmware of the app without

541
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:41,030
authenticating ourselves just going into

542
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:43,730
a port a workforce portal rather and

543
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,510
updating a firm uploading a firm

544
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:48,890
firmware without

545
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,630
changing it without authenticating

546
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:53,390
brother sorry so you can say luck here

547
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,849
or else word I say turn it on or over

548
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:59,808
plaque or and plaque that's what it is

549
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:03,140
so dangerous and if we come and go onto

550
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:07,010
the internet with the admin user we are

551
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:09,558
surprised to see that in default

552
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,020
by default the admin user has no

553
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,750
password so I type at men and I'm in and

554
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:18,349
this is quite problem because this would

555
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:21,710
be full control of the device of the IOT

556
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:26,390
device the idea would be a forensics

557
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:29,150
here right so for the party let's have

558
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:31,819
the log of all the commands that we're

559
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:34,130
running that way we will have a list of

560
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:38,480
everything we've done with the smart

561
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:42,109
plug you see what's red on screen that's

562
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,480
the frame that the is black get for

563
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:47,779
controlling purposes a green you see it

564
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:52,069
relay on so if I send the red part to

565
00:36:47,779 --> 00:36:57,140
this mop like the green comes on so if I

566
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:59,839
like a sensor here it is on so I can

567
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:03,038
turn on enough remotely this device

568
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:07,220
without the need for a password alright

569
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:12,020
just like this we can be quite naughty

570
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:14,689
what if I wanted 10 I wake up at 7 and

571
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:18,910
get my hot caffeine so I program it and

572
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:22,490
655 my coffeemaker and it goes on and

573
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:26,359
Brewers my cafe someone my rocket and

574
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:30,319
say that is 6:30 so when I said get up

575
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:32,210
it's cold terrible isn't it and maybe

576
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:34,759
they can say turn it on and off and on

577
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:37,819
and off until it blows up even worse

578
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,250
isn't it that my coffeemaker blows app

579
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:44,200
because of that that's another cybers

580
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:49,760
hack so you have the smart plug and the

581
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:51,980
coffeemaker and it all goes boom let's

582
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,500
say what information we can get out of

583
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:57,260
this device so on tell that it would be

584
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:00,020
like over dashboard we can see the

585
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:04,460
directory structure there is five main

586
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:06,860
drew's CFG nog nets are eos m ft and

587
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:11,420
mirrors we will explain what we can get

588
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:14,840
out of that as with any Linux can be LLC

589
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:20,270
deseeded or whatever on that we see on

590
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:22,310
history we see the routine the IP

591
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,890
routing table will have we're

592
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:28,430
disconnected and we can think as well I

593
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:32,299
can ping it remotely on another host so

594
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:33,620
if I think lots of hosts there may be a

595
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,440
problem with the house afterwards

596
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:38,810
because I'll be overloaded and also an

597
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:44,120
RP shop to see all the machines

598
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:46,549
connected on s and lung or whatever that

599
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:50,930
would be our IRP show but we also have

600
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:54,680
NTP where we don't see the users time

601
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:57,410
but the manufacturer's time and with TF

602
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:01,549
config you can find the IP address on

603
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:04,250
the OS directory with the threat command

604
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:07,550
we can see process is the same as H tour

605
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:09,710
if your know about light as Linux it

606
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:12,890
would be similar UCL purses on the

607
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:15,190
device if there were an a process that

608
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:19,549
is not authorized mal world whatever

609
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:23,180
just by using telnet without a password

610
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:26,900
and type in FET we would have it we are

611
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,089
done nothing else to be done simple as

612
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:32,960
that

613
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:38,060
and with men we see the rum a via memory

614
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,170
available on MFT well I thought it was

615
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,259
most agreeable but it's something

616
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:45,440
different on the MFT directory there is

617
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:48,350
this command there is test let read and

618
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,740
I top testlet read and there's a little

619
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,430
LED here it's off because the device is

620
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,509
off

621
00:39:52,430 --> 00:40:00,710
it's green when it's working red if it's

622
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:05,410
a failure so I type it test LED Brett

623
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:12,440
and if it's off it is spread but is test

624
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:13,460
LED on and off and and the LED or not I

625
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,990
don't know if it's

626
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,900
spen how many times can you turn on and

627
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:20,149
an LED no not-not-not

628
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,869
even have an hour that means that is not

629
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:25,849
good quality LED or who knows maybe it

630
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:31,160
should have been going on and off for

631
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:34,670
days and days and another order for

632
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:37,069
Amazon and the firmware version that we

633
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:39,260
can see that well as well we've changed

634
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:42,470
it remotely with this command we can see

635
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:44,990
which one's installed there's another

636
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:53,990
directory which is mirrors where we can

637
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:56,660
find out the real time time and so this

638
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:59,689
is not a discovery that this is a Spain

639
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,730
but if I find it anywhere around a

640
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,770
corner and we want to know whether it

641
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:06,589
was Russia or the US or when it came

642
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:09,650
from I can have an indicator about the

643
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:11,869
time zone when it was set up and then

644
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:15,290
Wi-Fi as well what can we know with

645
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:16,130
Wi-Fi we can know the name of the Wi-Fi

646
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,619
network

647
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:21,349
it is so that would be what's been set

648
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:24,890
up and the password from the Wi-Fi and

649
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:28,240
this is all plaintext it's not encrypted

650
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:32,299
you just open the file and you see it

651
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:35,569
timer sure is an AV peak a configuration

652
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:38,030
and here we also see DNS same as with

653
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:42,800
traffic interception we can see it it's

654
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:45,890
actually the same and oh IOT de pack you

655
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,980
see you testing is setup and everything

656
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:51,080
else here there's some fans that are not

657
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:54,140
a person and some others are very

658
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:56,839
important maybe one day we need to know

659
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,940
whether this iot was in Spain or

660
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:04,310
elsewhere and learned what survived free

661
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:07,420
they were on and then on CFG directory

662
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:11,630
we can reset to the factory settings of

663
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:14,869
the matte black so do you type brick

664
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:19,040
proof and aide recess is same as with

665
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:22,180
pressing the routers button with a clip

666
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:26,150
at home does the same so we could get

667
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:27,410
remotely delete it that could remotely

668
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,140
delete our current

669
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:33,288
and I've explained that with a slight

670
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:36,049
instead of plugging onto or locking onto

671
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:38,990
this map or there's not black I could do

672
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:42,200
it on telnet but someone thought that a

673
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:44,990
smart like that goes on the internet and

674
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:48,558
can control physical devices having a

675
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:50,538
telnet that is open by default without a

676
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,119
password thought it was a vulnerability

677
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:58,640
you think it's a vulnerability tangi no

678
00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:01,599
well as it seems odd cv e well they

679
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:06,200
decided to open a CV e so this was a

680
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:08,210
vulnerability so as soon as they opened

681
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:12,649
their vulnerability the manufacturer

682
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:17,089
changed it and crashed the telnet

683
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:19,849
service so now that device cannot be

684
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:22,279
locked on to through tablet so it is

685
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:25,369
down why did you tell us all of this

686
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,410
well as it seems if you go onto Amazon

687
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:30,500
or whatever shop and you buy this device

688
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:33,020
it will not be updated you will get the

689
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,859
device they have on stock this Jupiter

690
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:37,009
has on the stock

691
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:40,910
so the firmware will not be up to date

692
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:45,250
and ports are but you have same one I as

693
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:48,529
I got and so same vulnerabilities so

694
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:51,140
what I mean is that if a user buys the

695
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:53,930
device or it's are they do not update it

696
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:58,220
because it has to be done so just plug

697
00:43:53,930 --> 00:44:01,450
it it works and we will get lots of

698
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,770
devices on internet with the preset

699
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:05,750
configuration with all these issues and

700
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:10,279
we need to see whether they have been

701
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:14,349
victims of an attack or not but same as

702
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:17,420
with drones you have the device right

703
00:44:14,349 --> 00:44:19,849
then the phone controlling device that

704
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:23,059
something is different we also need to

705
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:25,940
look into that phone smart phone with

706
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:31,069
this demo I'll show you just the same

707
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:36,260
test and here we have to devise let me

708
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:41,650
turn it on this is a device with the apk

709
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,650
that remotely manages the smart

710
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,930
I will log into the phone

711
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:41,970
a geography face so you see this is a

712
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:44,310
way to go into the phone's memory so now

713
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:48,149
we have full access to the database and

714
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:51,349
our phone which is an Android as part of

715
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,349
the path way

716
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,600
with an LS you see all information or

717
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:19,940
four merits which is the app managing

718
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:21,380
there's a smart fly with a DB pull you

719
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,880
can do it on the computer well it takes

720
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,490
long so I will not do it here but I've

721
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:32,060
done it before hand so a DB pull pull

722
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:34,970
origin and destination so we just open

723
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:37,070
it and here we see the same folders as

724
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:39,620
we had inside the phone but now they are

725
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:43,730
on our computer and we can check them

726
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:46,279
out as soon as I see the databases

727
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:48,410
folder that's when I get all excited

728
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:52,550
that's what all the information I want

729
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:54,440
is there's some databases I open it you

730
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:58,310
can use any viewer but there's nothing

731
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:01,250
in there so I'm disappointed nothing

732
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:03,049
interesting in here but there's other

733
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:08,050
directories that have very interesting

734
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:08,050
things right so here

735
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:21,240
you have all the way

736
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:23,220
fires that the IOT device was locked on

737
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,799
well I've censured them because I know

738
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:29,819
them so but if we want to know whether

739
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:32,819
this IOT device had been on homes Wi-Fi

740
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:35,609
or a comfort of Wi-Fi here we can see it

741
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:37,579
and it is just as easy as opening it

742
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:40,859
here we have it

743
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:43,230
Wi-Fi name this one was long on three

744
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:45,990
Wi-Fi so it was not the phone but the

745
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:50,690
IOT device okay that was a smart plaque

746
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:50,689
that was on those three networks

747
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:18,779
my kendo and real India I'm doing this

748
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:26,759
life and it's not as easy as it might

749
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:29,220
seem this is my email my email address

750
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,970
all those pixels below click six what

751
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:34,560
was that

752
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:37,379
that's the users email the user is the

753
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,880
one who is managing the IOT device for

754
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,160
that you need to be registered in a

755
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,100
platform so this is a username on the

756
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,290
platform and down here what this is not

757
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:49,500
the password of course but you see we

758
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:53,070
can log in to what the platform allows

759
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,710
you can use that device so you can see

760
00:48:53,070 --> 00:49:08,750
this is not encrypted there is no kind

761
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:08,750
of security here and finally local cache

762
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:23,700
that's the name of the smartphone so

763
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:27,059
smart bloc sorry I say it's home smart

764
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,740
flow or bet black this one is cybercrime

765
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:30,779
that's the name have given it it could

766
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,660
be interesting to see how the person who

767
00:49:30,779 --> 00:49:37,829
was using it named it were somehow

768
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:40,069
wanted to name it and let me change to

769
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:40,069
this

770
00:50:00,609 --> 00:50:09,859
you look upon a key see what it says

771
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:12,200
turn off for an app so you can add some

772
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:16,119
commands on to the device so at a given

773
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:19,640
time run this so 4:00 p.m.

774
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:23,030
turn off burn up so the light goes off

775
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:25,940
and you can get in have an up yeah four

776
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:30,170
o'clock okay pinaki you just waste time

777
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:33,410
in poisons in there what else can I do

778
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:36,020
I can turn it on I can set different

779
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:38,390
times for things to happen for you to

780
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:41,509
control that I'm just giving you very

781
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:44,720
silly examples this is not a prologue

782
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:46,550
that anybody has been using but you'd be

783
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,580
surprised at the amount of information

784
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:52,160
these devices can save and it can be

785
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:58,848
terribly useful for instance the file

786
00:50:52,160 --> 00:51:02,089
keeping the AR AP ARP table well with a

787
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:06,290
mobile phone we might not be able to see

788
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:09,950
that but an IOT device with the I a RP

789
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:13,820
table we might find an a MAC address

790
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:17,210
that has been used and you would find

791
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:20,540
that a on this mark device sometimes

792
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:23,420
that path is very straight and we get to

793
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:26,960
our target easily sometimes we need to

794
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:29,740
go round and round until we find what we

795
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,740
finally want

796
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:40,299
okay now let's have a look at a

797
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:44,310
SmartWatch so can you raise the hand

798
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:47,860
your hands if your SmartWatch is Apple

799
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:51,970
I've got a polar I am NOT very terribly

800
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:55,770
rich or wealthy so this is my practical

801
00:51:51,970 --> 00:52:00,700
exercise on this polar typical

802
00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:04,720
SmartWatch used for sports is one for

803
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:09,910
double oh sorry M for mm which works

804
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:12,100
differently from other IOT devices like

805
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:14,529
the smart plug for instance in this case

806
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:16,569
the watch has to connect up to the

807
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:19,300
smartphone and the smartphone connects

808
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:22,000
up to the cloud anything the watch does

809
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:25,570
then has to go through the smartphone

810
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,780
before it gets to the cloud so if a

811
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:32,920
victim who's been killed was wearing

812
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:38,380
this watch the heart beats the heart

813
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:42,460
rate also has to go to then through his

814
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:44,770
or her smartphone and then it goes up in

815
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:48,640
the cloud you can analyse the SmartWatch

816
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:52,150
or the mova mobile phone but some Apple

817
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,730
ones have a SIM card that can connect

818
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:57,880
directly to the Internet in that case

819
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:59,770
you would need to analyze the watch you

820
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,930
could also check the mobile phone but

821
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:04,690
anyhow those that connect up to the

822
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:08,020
Internet as a standalone device without

823
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:12,609
the need for a smartphone Press Mart

824
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:15,220
phone would be different right but other

825
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:17,080
than that in most other devices you

826
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:20,350
would have that information on the

827
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,790
mobile phone so what am I going to do it

828
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:24,730
would be the same thing as we saw

829
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:27,250
earlier through ADB we connect up to the

830
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:32,080
device we go to the installation file

831
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:35,170
and we download all the databases I had

832
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:38,180
prepared that earlier on I downloaded

833
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:42,140
them here they are

834
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:47,538
we go to the shared folder can we find

835
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:55,098
all the SmartWatch so if we go to the

836
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:59,390
database folder we find this one here

837
00:53:55,099 --> 00:54:02,349
this database wow that's a lot of

838
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,348
information there

839
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:18,990
this is the cardiovascular information

840
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:22,410
days when the device recorded the heart

841
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:27,149
rate how long for at what time why is

842
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:33,200
this or zeroed well my watch doesn't

843
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:36,869
have the heart beat sensor for the rest

844
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:40,049
but on a band that has to be tied around

845
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:45,020
your waist you around your straps around

846
00:54:40,049 --> 00:54:49,470
your chest I would need to access this

847
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:53,549
so if you find that if it says zero it's

848
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:56,250
because the watch was not on was not one

849
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:59,759
properly or there was some

850
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:06,900
cardiovascular properly problem this is

851
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:11,760
the vise sensor and this one we have the

852
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:15,240
unique identifier for that a chest strip

853
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:18,569
or strap sorry this is the unique

854
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:22,578
identifier that number so if we want to

855
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:26,970
find the correct strap that this watch

856
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:29,750
works with that would be the identifier

857
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:29,750
I would need

858
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:40,259
here we have the information for the

859
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:42,900
training sessions here are the sessions

860
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:45,630
that have been saved how long for 22

861
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:47,849
minutes 20 minutes you see that's how

862
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:51,299
long it takes me to be exhausted when I

863
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:54,439
go running and here on the rice there's

864
00:55:51,299 --> 00:55:57,809
something most peculiar look at that URL

865
00:55:54,439 --> 00:56:00,749
well all the information could be

866
00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:05,069
accessed from that URL you could check

867
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:08,908
the GPS coordinates

868
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:11,969
what template details on temperature if

869
00:56:08,909 --> 00:56:18,179
I was competing up against anybody else

870
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:21,799
and in this case I didn't set it to tell

871
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:25,439
me about my Twitter Oh what's up

872
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:32,130
notifications I get I could get alerts

873
00:56:25,439 --> 00:56:34,769
on my smart smart watch screen to finish

874
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:36,029
with this section of the presentation I

875
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:40,379
would like to tell you a little bit

876
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:41,969
about other IOT devices this is a Cody

877
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,519
do you know what that is have you got

878
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:45,929
one please raise your hand sorry sorry I

879
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:48,839
just want to take a picture with your

880
00:56:45,929 --> 00:56:52,380
hands raised please keep them up here

881
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:56,219
for a second right for those of you who

882
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:59,309
don't know what a Cody is it's a device

883
00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:02,849
that allows us to watch multimedia

884
00:56:59,309 --> 00:57:06,779
contents at home and look you have a

885
00:57:02,849 --> 00:57:10,769
legal Cody's I have one at home to play

886
00:57:06,779 --> 00:57:15,179
YouTube video videos or music or

887
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:18,598
whatever but some people have one and

888
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:20,489
that's good for hacking somebody's

889
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,169
laughing laughing and that's why I

890
00:57:20,489 --> 00:57:25,380
wanted to take a picture of you with

891
00:57:22,169 --> 00:57:30,089
your hands raised without paying for it

892
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:33,269
so that you can wash a pay TV football

893
00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:36,839
matches for instance so is that right or

894
00:57:33,269 --> 00:57:39,959
wrong I'm just gonna tell you how to do

895
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:42,290
forensic analysis of this type of device

896
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:46,100
as well a Cody

897
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:50,210
a Cody has software that allows you to

898
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:52,790
watch multimedia contents and air Cody's

899
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:57,680
are normally installed on a raspberry

900
00:57:52,790 --> 00:58:00,380
why because a Raspberry Pi then goes to

901
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,419
the screen and that's in simple access

902
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:06,560
right for you to be able to watch a film

903
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:12,970
for instance forensic analysis in this

904
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:12,970
case could have two objectives one as

905
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:23,480
wanting to find criminals or victims who

906
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:28,640
had a coating at home that was hacked

907
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:31,730
and the Cody could be mined that would

908
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:34,790
mean I would then end up with problems

909
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:38,240
on my Raspberry Pi on my operating

910
00:58:34,790 --> 00:58:42,560
system or we might even suffer from a

911
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:46,240
cyber attack at all what's the goal

912
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,240
what's the evidence we need to look into

913
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:54,680
these is Pyrus libera it is the

914
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:56,780
operating system on which we can insult

915
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,839
code it well this is quite quite quite a

916
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:03,380
summary so the operating system will be

917
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:07,370
having a micro SD card which is 64 acres

918
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:09,890
and you can use Cody and you have

919
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:13,220
configured it for Spanish preset and

920
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:16,670
just what Adam for music play with

921
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:21,049
multimedia content which is ml m3u which

922
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:25,220
is IPTV system and there's some links

923
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:28,580
some you are else to send video life to

924
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:31,720
you our home this is the target that is

925
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:34,940
the source of it all naturally as I

926
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:38,839
explained on the first slide everything

927
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:43,100
that it's SD card pin drives everything

928
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:46,270
has to be always right in locked so that

929
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:49,759
they are not time good with and then

930
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:51,500
this is kind of a Linux system so we can

931
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,830
try and find the same information we

932
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:55,610
would have found on Linux was this good

933
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:58,970
for nine

934
00:59:55,610 --> 01:00:01,520
2% of what you can get with what I'm

935
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:04,040
about to tell you can be transferred

936
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,980
into a Linux system those commands or

937
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:08,110
information will be on a Linux system

938
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:11,030
[Music]

939
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:16,460
let me show you the information we can

940
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:21,860
get out of it I'll use it with ftk this

941
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:24,140
is a software that people can use easily

942
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:26,420
probably you can have it in Linux no

943
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:29,359
problem there but with ftk will be

944
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:40,580
simpler even simpler so these are

945
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:43,790
Windows virtual machine so we have this

946
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:45,890
micro SD card that we've captured with a

947
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:48,800
cloner and we have to check that image

948
01:00:45,890 --> 01:01:01,640
which is the forensic dump in of the

949
01:00:48,800 --> 01:01:03,680
card as easy if this good antivirus news

950
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:06,819
app is there so we are protected use

951
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,819
that can be proud of me

952
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:21,390
so this is the microSD card funny is

953
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:25,050
this a 64 card but see what the image

954
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:27,240
takes it's a little over 380 acres so

955
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:30,900
what's good here is that we don't need

956
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:35,459
to use a 64 gig but you can compress it

957
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:38,070
so 64 it's only compressing to over

958
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:40,260
three games little over three gigs is

959
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:50,130
easier to move around and work with it

960
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:59,880
and everything so this is not the

961
01:01:50,130 --> 01:02:01,860
purpose here once we have that image we

962
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:04,190
see the two partitions first one is the

963
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:07,200
system we will not go into there is only

964
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:14,120
512 mega and we're interesting the

965
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:20,460
second one so this is a partition will

966
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:24,210
we're load-in it so second one we're not

967
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:25,890
interested in and we go to root so if

968
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:28,110
you've ever been on linux this is quite

969
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:30,150
similar to the world

970
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:34,590
the file system is quite similar to

971
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:37,290
linux so if we go into root and the

972
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:39,140
cache folder we need to find the

973
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:43,590
hostname which is the name of the host

974
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:45,990
self-explanatory and is Levi alike

975
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:47,730
that's the name and so that's why we

976
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:49,859
know that's how we know what we're

977
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,900
looking into I cheated because I've

978
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:54,570
produced image myself but it seems that

979
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:56,430
if we have an SD card or an image and we

980
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,270
don't know what we're looking into it is

981
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:59,640
that easy

982
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:01,170
that's going into the hast name and see

983
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:05,759
that is the liver Lac which is the

984
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:09,720
operating system that is used to recover

985
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:12,540
him it is a name it that is copied on

986
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,799
the SD card and it's so useful you go

987
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:16,130
into the directory and you know about

988
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,130
that

989
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:24,240
I'm in cone and folder we have other net

990
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:29,660
whatever this number can change based on

991
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:29,660
the other net card it is a board rather

992
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:37,410
so I'm settings we see this setup of the

993
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:39,510
HTTP that this device has so we know the

994
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:43,649
last time it was updated was this time

995
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:47,160
here and that it had this IP address so

996
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:49,500
it's a local IP but this can be an

997
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:53,970
indication of what kind of networks they

998
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:57,330
were working on so 190-200 uses TT these

999
01:03:53,970 --> 01:04:01,980
are home networks those others are

1000
01:03:57,330 --> 01:04:03,480
business can it help we don't know it

1001
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,520
depends what we're looking into you and

1002
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,860
then we'll see whether it helps or not

1003
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:10,470
there's this other file as history

1004
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:13,260
history I don't know because the B is

1005
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:16,350
missing missing is usually past mr. bass

1006
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:18,510
history but no be here and this is a

1007
01:04:16,350 --> 01:04:21,930
file will we keep every command that's

1008
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:25,590
been run by the user on Linux every user

1009
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:27,750
has a file that is past history will you

1010
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:31,500
keep all the commands that you will run

1011
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:33,960
and for forensics it's very useful that

1012
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:37,280
way we know what a user has done with

1013
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:40,550
the computers here you see that they run

1014
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:44,190
everything CDLs

1015
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:45,150
move it and look at their since I know

1016
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:47,850
what I'm after

1017
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:50,790
I just find it in the not in a minute it

1018
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:53,220
was it is real live I need to go line by

1019
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:56,730
line and see what it means we have see

1020
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:59,220
the plug in video live stream Pro see if

1021
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:02,880
you know what code is about this is an

1022
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:06,240
app rather a plugin that you can use to

1023
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,940
watch videos and all the legal videos

1024
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,419
but almost illegal on Cody so that's the

1025
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:13,590
target

1026
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:19,980
we know this press pie was used to watch

1027
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:23,300
video on the live stream Pro plugin so

1028
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:23,300
Cody next

1029
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:37,750
that folder at on Adams if I'm not

1030
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:41,220
mistaken yes it's here and we see the

1031
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:49,510
plugin that the user installed manually

1032
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:52,149
this is it he have the whole setup for

1033
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:55,500
the plug-in as I said this is the only

1034
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:59,140
change of the preset of the default

1035
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:02,590
setup these plugins so here we'll see

1036
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:05,529
whether it's malicious or not so we'll

1037
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:07,660
look into the code so we're looking to

1038
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:09,700
it as I said and this what we see it

1039
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,930
might be or might not be but that's not

1040
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:13,569
what we're interested in

1041
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:16,629
we're interested in something else so if

1042
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:18,369
we go to the user data folder us the

1043
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:22,470
information we would be interested in

1044
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:22,470
that's the users information

1045
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:40,809
so we open this total file folder and we

1046
01:06:35,499 --> 01:06:44,229
see storage list m3 u dot ye by well

1047
01:06:40,809 --> 01:06:47,259
just plugins to nothing but they only

1048
01:06:44,229 --> 01:06:51,399
run if you eat emitters you list where

1049
01:06:47,259 --> 01:06:53,949
you get every URL with illegal content

1050
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:56,769
so the plugin itself is not illegal

1051
01:06:53,949 --> 01:06:59,469
what's illegal is the m3 year list that

1052
01:06:56,769 --> 01:07:02,288
you might have here and you have these

1053
01:06:59,469 --> 01:07:05,469
in storage so if we move to this road

1054
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:14,769
here above here we can get it out we can

1055
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:19,059
mine it out I kill Adela Morales na

1056
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:25,149
here's the list of course we can export

1057
01:07:19,059 --> 01:07:27,759
it and then we can say and watch it just

1058
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:32,199
open it on notepad and you have the list

1059
01:07:27,759 --> 01:07:34,150
there of course some censorship here so

1060
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:36,910
that you don't know where the signal is

1061
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:40,749
coming from but what else what else can

1062
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:43,719
we get out of a coding locks logs that

1063
01:07:40,749 --> 01:07:46,089
we for experts in forensics like so much

1064
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:54,539
log is over everything let's export of

1065
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:54,538
you right click export uncoded log

1066
01:07:54,970 --> 01:08:08,529
you see every failure every time the

1067
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:12,040
rest PI has failed so this is m3u and

1068
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:14,920
and it's failed right this one's failed

1069
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:18,460
this one's failed so even if I remove

1070
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:22,080
the m3u file from the directory this is

1071
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:25,270
a log of all the lists is been visiting

1072
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,899
here we have this other lock which is

1073
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:34,300
interesting

1074
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:37,059
I think it's line 11 we get the

1075
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:40,230
Raspberry Pi where it had been installed

1076
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:43,990
it's a PI team will be revealed

1077
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:46,330
1.1 so if we'd only have the image of

1078
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:50,550
the SD image we know which Raspberry Pi

1079
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:50,550
to look for and where it was installed

1080
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:55,960
these are examples I'm coming up with

1081
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:58,840
and naturally a quality analysis would

1082
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:01,120
need to go into every single line trying

1083
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:02,890
to find something specific what else can

1084
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,200
we get here we can see that the

1085
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:07,540
Raspberry Pi who is being controlled

1086
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:09,130
with a Logitech keyboard that's

1087
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,410
important isn't it we need to find the

1088
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:17,100
Logitech keyboard to see which one was

1089
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:20,830
login and then just to finish on network

1090
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:24,160
we see the network configuration as I

1091
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:28,029
said before so with the devices we have

1092
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:31,720
the IP they are logging on team so you

1093
01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:35,340
think this is Movistar Deanna's so this

1094
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:38,500
is humless nothing wrong about it still

1095
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:44,440
that could help us understand what I

1096
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:46,890
pass it's been login to the exam go to

1097
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:46,889
machine

1098
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:12,670
so what is the advantage here well all

1099
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:17,560
this research surgical that I can do at

1100
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:19,690
home personally I use it t for real

1101
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:22,690
police operation so everything I'm

1102
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:26,139
saying here that might seem pointless

1103
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:28,900
here doesn't make much sense to you but

1104
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:31,360
what I'm explaining here I can use it in

1105
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:35,049
what I do in the fight against cyber

1106
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:36,759
crime and evidence so all those hours at

1107
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:41,770
home and everywhere else

1108
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:45,130
this server a real purpose what I've

1109
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:46,780
explained here serves a true purpose so

1110
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:49,989
you need to take that into account all

1111
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:54,690
these details that a given time will

1112
01:10:49,989 --> 01:10:59,950
he'll be get into state information then

1113
01:10:54,690 --> 01:11:04,059
go D happen these devices are not nicely

1114
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:05,500
set up so if we try an nmap on one of

1115
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:09,280
these you can do that at home you can

1116
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:13,000
try that but by default port 22 is open

1117
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:14,830
once again the problem with these

1118
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,560
devices there is an SSH which is a

1119
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:20,650
remote control that is open by a defect

1120
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:23,290
so there might have password that is a

1121
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:25,870
bit more robust right what's the

1122
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:30,280
password here go into Google and say bye

1123
01:11:25,870 --> 01:11:35,739
so default password first forum user is

1124
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:38,800
route the Scout and pattern free choice

1125
01:11:35,739 --> 01:11:41,559
so we have leave it elect that's what

1126
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,840
they've chosen and that's for any device

1127
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:45,790
on the Internet and that's generic for

1128
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:48,670
all of them so this is quite a fail

1129
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:52,450
there is a security problem and at home

1130
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:54,219
if we have a free choice for pirate TV I

1131
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:55,840
might be watching TV but some other

1132
01:11:54,219 --> 01:11:58,870
people buy beats they've seen what I do

1133
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,780
but we asked forensic experts are scared

1134
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:03,880
because we can lock onto your device and

1135
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:07,000
perform a forensic analysis because same

1136
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:09,550
as I said with ftk with dumping of the

1137
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,530
SD card you can get all that same

1138
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:13,750
information with the remote as I say

1139
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:15,820
so you can be at home in Madrid and look

1140
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:18,490
into a cloudy anywhere else in the world

1141
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:22,990
because I do have remote access to that

1142
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:26,590
device there's a symbol as well on to

1143
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:31,420
share every folder so all the folders in

1144
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:34,930
it are shared on the homegroup known

1145
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:36,880
group you can go in and upload and of

1146
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:38,500
course no need for a password no pods

1147
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,570
were there this is quite a fail right

1148
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:43,450
but we find it useful because

1149
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:46,090
forensically we can get information in a

1150
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:49,450
very simple way we just connect a device

1151
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:52,480
or lock device onto the Internet and

1152
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:54,820
that's it and as I said before remote

1153
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:57,370
working you might think there's a sci-fi

1154
01:12:54,820 --> 01:13:00,549
but you just need to go into shodhan and

1155
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:04,000
find libera Alegre free choice and for

1156
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:06,520
Spain there is 60 plus devices which

1157
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:10,420
right now are accessible from the

1158
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:13,120
internet and the home of someone who has

1159
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:17,860
misconfigured them so for any of those

1160
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:21,120
IPS I can go in with SSH and take

1161
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:27,339
control and be on the local network

1162
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:31,330
this is children this is real life and

1163
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:34,060
same with green box but this is already

1164
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:39,100
pre-installed this is a vulnerability of

1165
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:42,310
our dream box IP where I can see all the

1166
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:48,520
users through a browser without a user

1167
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:51,100
or a password so when it's simple

1168
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:55,600
devices for example a security camera

1169
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:58,390
and smart plug I'd advise to see that I

1170
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:00,790
home a TV at home we want it to be

1171
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:02,920
simple go in black and enjoy a problem

1172
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:07,060
with Coenen and plugin and in Chinese

1173
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:09,370
that they hold default config all those

1174
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:12,310
fails we are dragging them around and as

1175
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:15,070
I said it should not be the user that

1176
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:17,350
has to fight against that it has to be

1177
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:19,299
the manufacturer that by default make

1178
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:21,190
sure that those are secure system I

1179
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:25,070
cannot ask my friend who knows nothing

1180
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:27,620
about IT to close down and SSH or change

1181
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:29,960
- tell me password or update defeat of

1182
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:31,820
an IP camera it has to be done within a

1183
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:36,610
factory it cannot be done by a user

1184
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:36,610
because they lack the knowledge to do so

1185
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:45,380
again a different device very

1186
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:52,400
interesting run a router so that's where

1187
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:56,450
we get the internet from typical box so

1188
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:59,540
as I said we had to audit a router to

1189
01:14:56,450 --> 01:15:03,980
see if a person involved in a murder had

1190
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:05,990
been aim are they home or not so this is

1191
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:07,759
a forensic analysis of a regular photo

1192
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:10,730
from router see if you have Vodafone at

1193
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,770
home and I have fiber router this is

1194
01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:14,929
what's used for of for the phone browser

1195
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:19,700
and map once again to see how many

1196
01:15:14,930 --> 01:15:25,490
services are running same protocol and

1197
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:30,920
map surface and in again here there is

1198
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:33,950
an SSH um let's try our life let's try

1199
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:37,850
to get connected to it is not that route

1200
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:43,690
but an admin well an admin into the SSH

1201
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:48,890
and we're in the router avast model of

1202
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:53,650
the router we're in first thing I run L

1203
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:57,050
as a list of every directory LS fails

1204
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:59,660
there's no LS in the configuration but I

1205
01:15:57,050 --> 01:16:02,180
show something else all configuration

1206
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:05,290
options on the dashboard of the router

1207
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:08,390
well this is even better than them l as

1208
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:11,870
here we see the LAN configuration the

1209
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:17,390
NOC table and everything else right so

1210
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:20,150
if we round show is info so sis info we

1211
01:16:17,390 --> 01:16:22,100
see the vehm work if it's updated or not

1212
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:24,799
if it is running a version this is not

1213
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:27,770
the right one we see the time that it's

1214
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:29,720
been on since it was turned off it might

1215
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:32,090
be interesting maybe not it will always

1216
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:34,660
depend on the specific case before as I

1217
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:38,840
mean shows us the time whether it's on

1218
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:41,830
is tuned or not usually it should be

1219
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:44,000
otherwise it wouldn't make sense about

1220
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:46,730
Sheamus with the smart black where we

1221
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:51,020
had to run a command to see the load of

1222
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:55,369
the processor here with the CPE show the

1223
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:59,090
CPU will see the CPU side is 2.48

1224
01:16:55,369 --> 01:17:01,040
usually the processor slow disk low but

1225
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:03,949
had been attacked with the Trojan and

1226
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:09,199
was mining a cryptocurrency as Moreira

1227
01:17:03,949 --> 01:17:11,540
we would not see 2.48 by 1995 hundred

1228
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:13,638
percent that would be an indication that

1229
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:16,909
there's something on going on with the

1230
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:20,119
router we are long to it but cannot be a

1231
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:22,040
90% working load that means that there's

1232
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:24,500
something going on same with showmen

1233
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:30,530
when you see the RAM memory that is

1234
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:33,650
available so ARP ARP we can see the ARP

1235
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:36,110
table if someone thought of an ARP

1236
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:39,230
poisoning attack inside of it

1237
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:41,750
we'll see it as easy as just like that

1238
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:44,000
because we see the IP is well rather the

1239
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:48,380
router things that IP is something it

1240
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:53,540
should not be so we see some anomaly in

1241
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:57,710
the network as for a dhcp status we see

1242
01:17:53,540 --> 01:18:00,409
every device connected connected to

1243
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:03,020
these and so we see if someone is

1244
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:05,269
hacking into our Wi-Fi if someone

1245
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:08,330
hacking on us there will be an extra

1246
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:11,150
device that should not be there with

1247
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:14,030
show not entries we'll see the set up of

1248
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:15,860
the final tribal of the prophet area

1249
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:19,489
someone's taken control over the browser

1250
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:22,040
and is using it to send a service or put

1251
01:18:19,489 --> 01:18:24,589
it live we will see it here because it

1252
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:26,630
had to start a standard or a rule rather

1253
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:28,130
or have a service that is a sniff and

1254
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:31,699
that's the only way to see the root

1255
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:33,440
router we cannot throw a net shot or

1256
01:18:31,699 --> 01:18:38,480
anything like that but we can do this to

1257
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:41,449
see what's going on and all the

1258
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:45,678
processes that are running there that's

1259
01:18:41,449 --> 01:18:48,589
one which is a remote SSH it is not that

1260
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:50,449
is someone who has attacked our router

1261
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:51,469
with a Trojan and controlling it

1262
01:18:50,449 --> 01:18:54,080
remotely

1263
01:18:51,469 --> 01:18:57,620
in order to do this I had to lock on

1264
01:18:54,080 --> 01:19:00,019
with ss8 and that's a register there to

1265
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:02,840
an extent that you see the IP that I've

1266
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:06,699
used someone from the Ukraine for

1267
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:09,199
example we would see a Ukraine IP here

1268
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:13,549
remotely administering or managing the

1269
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:17,419
router then finally once again what we

1270
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:21,199
all like log files we'll love lock files

1271
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:23,600
if we run the show lock command we see

1272
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:26,629
all the locks in that router

1273
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,370
it's easier if we download it not just

1274
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:32,630
seeing it on the screen we can download

1275
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:35,410
it and we at the digital signature and

1276
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:40,219
we look into it and this is one of it

1277
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:45,769
over the time which is nothing but a

1278
01:19:40,219 --> 01:19:48,469
file already edited and shows only what

1279
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:50,900
we're interested in in real life there's

1280
01:19:48,469 --> 01:19:52,850
thousands of prongs and lines that you

1281
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:55,900
need to read one by one to see what we

1282
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:59,540
want to see here I have it already ready

1283
01:19:55,900 --> 01:20:02,299
usually they come from soft bottom app

1284
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:05,600
is usually bottom up first thing we see

1285
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:08,570
is yeah that's right on the 4th of

1286
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:13,580
November lead was reset to factory

1287
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:16,730
settings from this IP address so here we

1288
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:20,330
see how it's booting and the time to

1289
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:24,889
boot it's 38 seconds and how the NTP

1290
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:27,350
timer is up to date days go by and here

1291
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:30,739
we have a lock where there's been an

1292
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:33,830
attack attempt from Reykjavik from this

1293
01:20:30,739 --> 01:20:37,610
IP address from this port so the router

1294
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:40,280
at home is recording every attack on you

1295
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:43,190
you cannot seize but the router can and

1296
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:46,969
can lock them away and keeps records and

1297
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:51,949
in this is puffin attack on the IP

1298
01:20:46,969 --> 01:20:55,430
address this is a local IP address so

1299
01:20:51,949 --> 01:20:58,009
some another device I hadn't a spoofing

1300
01:20:55,430 --> 01:21:01,880
on the router router found it and shows

1301
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:05,810
it on the log here we have it there's

1302
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:09,380
another spoofing here you see this date

1303
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:13,190
that is November 22nd we see the router

1304
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:16,960
firmware updated and it was done by

1305
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:20,059
Vodafone Vodafone can connect remotely

1306
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:23,050
movies are orange they all work the same

1307
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:27,820
way and so they updated the firmware

1308
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:30,080
from the router here you see for example

1309
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:35,440
another firewall alert

1310
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:39,969
so from this address here there's a drop

1311
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:43,759
so a machine is trying to get connected

1312
01:21:39,969 --> 01:21:46,390
1.55 and the router drops the connection

1313
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:49,210
because it's not part of the firewall

1314
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:52,040
here what we see is all the devices

1315
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:54,050
logging into the Wi-Fi every time

1316
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:56,960
there's a device logging onto the Wi-Fi

1317
01:21:54,050 --> 01:22:00,040
there is a record even if it is I don't

1318
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:03,860
know two months ago the router has

1319
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:07,870
recorded that it is on how do I see that

1320
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:12,889
first the MAC address for the station

1321
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:20,809
the MAC address for the client and also

1322
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:23,719
the LEAs in time here it gets 155 that's

1323
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:27,710
the address name least and we know that

1324
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:30,650
on November the 24th that our the device

1325
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:33,830
with that address connected legally

1326
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:35,719
whether illegal legally or legally we

1327
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:38,390
don't care but it could connect it there

1328
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:43,160
and here we see there was a logout from

1329
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:44,929
this IP address using the password look

1330
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,660
out and then there was another access

1331
01:22:44,929 --> 01:22:50,900
using the admin password from this

1332
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:53,269
address here could be local public

1333
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:55,660
depending on how the routers set up if

1334
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:58,520
it's public

1335
01:22:55,660 --> 01:23:00,410
we would have quite a problem with our

1336
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:03,680
routers security and all this

1337
01:23:00,410 --> 01:23:06,050
information out of the device that we

1338
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:09,020
all have at home that allows us to get

1339
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:11,720
on line see all the information that we

1340
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:15,830
are storing on the Smart Watch or a

1341
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:20,930
router or a smart plug etc all right

1342
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:23,600
then I'm about to finish a discussing IP

1343
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:25,700
cameras but there is another way to go

1344
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:29,270
into it and it's the firmware which

1345
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:34,040
would be the operating system same as

1346
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:36,140
Windows 7 or Vinci or Windows XP that's

1347
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:37,970
with these kind of devices and we also

1348
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:41,660
need to look into it to see how it works

1349
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:44,360
and see how to go into the defines and

1350
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:46,760
maybe I get this Smart Watch or smart

1351
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:49,339
plot it's my path and I have to look

1352
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:51,440
into it maybe it is to risk it to you

1353
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:54,410
perform the analysis on the device right

1354
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:56,269
away maybe it will be more useful to

1355
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:59,870
download the firmware that the device

1356
01:23:56,270 --> 01:24:03,350
has the look into and see for example if

1357
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:05,420
there's an SSH if the password is there

1358
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:08,090
or see if there's something in between

1359
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:10,070
oh this an 8 is that port port 80

1360
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:12,530
something same as with the operating

1361
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:14,420
system if I check it in that computer I

1362
01:24:12,530 --> 01:24:17,150
can see what's going on on the computer

1363
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:21,350
what the computer has been and set up

1364
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:22,969
for and if it's Apache I'll see that

1365
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:25,190
there will be Apache in there same way

1366
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:28,760
as if I look into the firmware and I see

1367
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:32,419
that there is Sh I will see and go into

1368
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:35,810
that device and secondarily I can also

1369
01:24:32,420 --> 01:24:38,230
use its you look into the device maybe

1370
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:41,780
it cannot get nothing right out of the

1371
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:44,959
plot but we can download the firmware

1372
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:49,730
from the smart flag and we look into the

1373
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:55,220
firmware as usual when we got the

1374
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:59,959
firmware it's usually a binary file and

1375
01:24:55,220 --> 01:25:01,910
so we check the integrity of the test I

1376
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,450
think I've already downloaded some

1377
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:04,450
firmware

1378
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:14,330
okay from you cannot see bars that's how

1379
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:17,630
a firmware is supposed to look like that

1380
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:20,210
bin which is a binary file if I open it

1381
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:22,100
I won't be able to open it but we need

1382
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:22,550
to decompile it when you need to extract

1383
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:37,870
it

1384
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:45,530
we have been walk if I'm not mistaken

1385
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:47,030
Bing walk variable mi and then what we

1386
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:49,190
what in the framework whether we want to

1387
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:52,190
check these are some tasks it takes a

1388
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:55,940
some time leave it there

1389
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:58,879
stop it because I have it on this other

1390
01:25:55,940 --> 01:26:00,469
side I've done it yesterday usually it

1391
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,990
takes some time because it has to read

1392
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:05,780
the binary file it has to interpret in

1393
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:06,860
parse all the information in it and show

1394
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:09,050
it in a way that is easily

1395
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:11,290
understandable for a human being I did

1396
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:14,210
that yesterday and here we have the file

1397
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:17,810
the sip of file what do we get out of

1398
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:22,730
pin walk open it there's a folder a

1399
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:25,040
structure and we opened them and this is

1400
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:31,969
where we go something that is pretty

1401
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:36,800
similar to a Linux system TPMS is prop

1402
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:39,680
home media etc so get Linux now any

1403
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:41,840
Linux and you will see that file

1404
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:43,840
structure an IP camera you look at it

1405
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,370
just the same as if it were a regular

1406
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:50,810
Linux system and what information can we

1407
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:54,230
get out of that okay let me start with

1408
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:56,840
GA so that you see the structure is very

1409
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:59,150
similar so let's see what we're looking

1410
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:01,670
into it here right now this is an IP

1411
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:07,009
camera I know that but if we didn't know

1412
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:10,180
this is the emoji for the app and that's

1413
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:10,180
an IP camera right

1414
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,690
on wireless

1415
01:27:24,050 --> 01:27:31,350
yeah we see the setup of the Wi-Fi

1416
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:38,580
network for our I become I busy it was

1417
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:42,540
locked on to you all right password en

1418
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:45,510
is and everything else those IP cameras

1419
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:48,420
had to load on somewhere to upload the

1420
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:50,310
information this file here shows as the

1421
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:52,320
Wi-Fi that has been set up for

1422
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:56,070
connection and where it is being

1423
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:58,139
uploaded the idea here would be for you

1424
01:27:56,070 --> 01:28:01,349
to see this is a Linux system so don't

1425
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:04,199
be ascared evade it's just like going

1426
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:06,869
onto a Linux or Ubuntu or Debian or

1427
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:11,669
whatever any regular one

1428
01:28:06,869 --> 01:28:13,170
no nothing but that on IOT as I said the

1429
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:16,920
complications always gaining access to

1430
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:19,290
the memory once we are in it it's same

1431
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:21,480
as with a pendrive or a hard disk

1432
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:23,730
problem with IOT is going into the

1433
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:26,989
memory if we don't gain access to the

1434
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:30,480
memory we will not be able to eject in

1435
01:28:26,989 --> 01:28:32,580
of course I had to buy many devices and

1436
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:35,428
tests so many some you can look into

1437
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:37,830
some others are very well secured lines

1438
01:28:35,429 --> 01:28:40,290
well taped and you cannot go in those

1439
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:42,480
some others you come as the ones that

1440
01:28:40,290 --> 01:28:44,909
I've just shown a minute ago you can

1441
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:47,489
look into them right away you can just

1442
01:28:44,909 --> 01:28:49,530
put them live and connect them to you

1443
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:51,388
whatever settlement or whatever but

1444
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:52,920
there are some other devices which for

1445
01:28:51,389 --> 01:28:55,170
whatever the reason cannot be looked

1446
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:57,540
into because there is no SSH or well

1447
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:59,550
secularized does not mean that those

1448
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:01,679
devices do not keep forensic information

1449
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:04,320
what it means is that we cannot have

1450
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:05,550
access because it's not a lot by the

1451
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:08,299
configuration it happened with two

1452
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:12,630
devices actually one was a decoder that

1453
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:14,790
was movi stars typical one that we have

1454
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:17,369
in home and I could not go in why's that

1455
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:20,550
because there was no service life only

1456
01:29:17,369 --> 01:29:23,460
the port where we would have movie star

1457
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:26,070
Stella charge to change the channel come

1458
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:29,400
fake that one I could not look into and

1459
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:30,929
then a smart light that you get it from

1460
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:33,228
the cell phone you change the colors and

1461
01:29:30,929 --> 01:29:35,420
that's it the smart light

1462
01:29:33,229 --> 01:29:37,610
yes I could look into that but the

1463
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:43,030
manufacturers sent an update and the

1464
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:45,409
update lucked any access to the device

1465
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:47,059
so I have a smart light I hope that

1466
01:29:45,409 --> 01:29:51,039
helps for light but forensic Elaine

1467
01:29:47,059 --> 01:29:54,800
speaking nothing else stone and terrible

1468
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:58,219
when it all fails we cannot say ok let's

1469
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:02,090
go home we need to find a plan B or C or

1470
01:29:58,219 --> 01:30:07,219
D if necessary to go into this kind of

1471
01:30:02,090 --> 01:30:09,889
devices Plan B here is no MIT let me

1472
01:30:07,219 --> 01:30:11,959
thank all the help given to me from the

1473
01:30:09,889 --> 01:30:15,440
electronics not so much for its sex but

1474
01:30:11,959 --> 01:30:18,320
electronic for the analysis that I'm

1475
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:23,839
going to explain in a minute from that

1476
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:27,049
time we move on and so it's not a

1477
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:30,590
necessary or a telnet now it'll be a

1478
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:32,809
higher level all the way up to the chip

1479
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:35,360
all the electronics is not about a

1480
01:30:32,809 --> 01:30:39,590
service running it's not about not

1481
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:43,098
knowing whether it is Wi-Fi or not it is

1482
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:44,809
hard drive memory level same as if we

1483
01:30:43,099 --> 01:30:47,900
had a laptop and we want to see the

1484
01:30:44,809 --> 01:30:49,849
process is running this way we'll see

1485
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:54,920
the information that we have on the hard

1486
01:30:49,849 --> 01:30:58,400
drive we have DTaP JTAC which is a

1487
01:30:54,920 --> 01:31:01,369
testing port and what it does is we go

1488
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:04,909
on with deep talk and we have the

1489
01:31:01,369 --> 01:31:08,239
firmware of the memory there we can have

1490
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:10,848
an IP coming up with them but the

1491
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:13,820
manufacturers they don't like us doing

1492
01:31:10,849 --> 01:31:15,679
this so they D they tack ports are

1493
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:19,429
scattered throughout the board so it's

1494
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:22,340
very difficult to have a datak without

1495
01:31:19,429 --> 01:31:26,300
the datasheet without having information

1496
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:28,130
or they were blueprint you have it here

1497
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:30,639
because it's important but it is not

1498
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:33,860
very useful because difficult to do

1499
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:37,729
another way around it may be more

1500
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:43,308
efficient would be I have usually these

1501
01:31:37,729 --> 01:31:45,739
devices have some dumb memories blue you

1502
01:31:43,309 --> 01:31:46,640
see the board for the decoder that I

1503
01:31:45,739 --> 01:31:50,330
said I could

1504
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:53,480
look into this they're basically that

1505
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:55,309
has some boards and what this one here

1506
01:31:53,480 --> 01:31:58,639
this one here and it was two numbers

1507
01:31:55,310 --> 01:32:02,270
there that's a model or it says what it

1508
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:06,950
is we might check that datasheet for

1509
01:32:02,270 --> 01:32:09,620
that number the top one so we find that

1510
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:16,370
one the one end in eut and it says it's

1511
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:19,970
a ZT box decoder and what about Samson

1512
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:23,330
for one whatever we see those are 120

1513
01:32:19,970 --> 01:32:26,630
Megas of memory that were interested in

1514
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:29,240
none memory is a hard drive is the

1515
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:31,070
memory in a pendrive that's what we're

1516
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:33,230
interested in and what about the other

1517
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:35,509
one a.m. and we see there's the RAM

1518
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:39,740
memory ser whatever we're not interested

1519
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:42,410
in that goal Samson 401 and 28 Magus of

1520
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:44,059
information of memory we need to get

1521
01:32:42,410 --> 01:32:48,530
that information out how can we get it

1522
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:52,040
out Eva the circuits connections are

1523
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:56,389
exposed cannot see you right well the

1524
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:58,400
top one pins are exposed so you can

1525
01:32:56,390 --> 01:33:01,010
touch them there you can use techniques

1526
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:03,170
such as the head them there cannot

1527
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:04,850
because it's cheap it's covering every

1528
01:33:03,170 --> 01:33:08,540
contact and say there's nothing you can

1529
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:10,340
do find the data yeah usually it

1530
01:33:08,540 --> 01:33:12,380
says it's confidential manufacturers

1531
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:15,260
don't like as playing around with what

1532
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:18,440
they produce and with the datasheet we

1533
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:21,260
can see every 48 pins they're here

1534
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:26,780
would you cannot see but number 13 14

1535
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:29,540
will be VCC 15 will be VSS lund and mass

1536
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:33,080
rather and then the clock but with the

1537
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:35,210
datasheet we see each of the pins and we

1538
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:40,220
need to connect with them to get and

1539
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:42,080
dump the information but not 48:17 is

1540
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:44,770
more than enough and we need to follow

1541
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,769
the datasheet

1542
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:50,450
this is what it looks like with the

1543
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:52,730
heart it would be like adding a Lego and

1544
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:54,620
one person on top of the other

1545
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:57,169
connectors are used or pins are usually

1546
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:59,360
a match and if it all matches we can

1547
01:33:57,170 --> 01:33:59,750
dump the memory chip is like cloning a

1548
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:03,500
heart

1549
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:07,460
but on a shadow whatever we have that

1550
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:15,010
kind of a connection but there's a

1551
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:18,740
problem on the right side what would DC

1552
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:21,500
see what's on top of the tape know what

1553
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:25,429
that is a condenser you see the size of

1554
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:26,960
the tape right or tape right so see the

1555
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:30,140
size of the condenser you need to take

1556
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:32,680
it out for the heart to be supported so

1557
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:36,080
that it's not that it requires

1558
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:39,320
intelligence or skills or knowledge it's

1559
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:42,530
a skills manual skills what it takes for

1560
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:45,940
a welding spot or removing a condenser

1561
01:34:42,530 --> 01:34:49,070
or connecting two pins without a problem

1562
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:52,129
so it's all about practice training and

1563
01:34:49,070 --> 01:34:54,469
practice M if I'm given a chip like this

1564
01:34:52,130 --> 01:35:00,710
one here or a nun some some memory as

1565
01:34:54,470 --> 01:35:03,680
this one here and I'm told perform a hat

1566
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:05,750
here probably I'll break it this is a

1567
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:07,700
condenser a small thin here and I have

1568
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:10,480
to move it I don't remove it right I

1569
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:13,610
break the board it takes some skills a

1570
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:18,799
way of working that is very specific

1571
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:21,110
right so what might happen that the

1572
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:23,360
board doesn't work that the heart

1573
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:26,839
doesn't work there can be some varnish

1574
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:29,389
made and so they had will not see it on

1575
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:31,610
the pins we will connect something but

1576
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:33,080
there will not be electric connection

1577
01:35:31,610 --> 01:35:37,849
and it will not work so it will be

1578
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:40,610
plenty instead of a hat we can use one

1579
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:43,550
of our own so these memory chips these

1580
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:46,250
are the extra memory cards that we have

1581
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:48,680
on Olympus cameras which are not SD but

1582
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:51,800
wider and shorter as the one you have in

1583
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:56,920
the picture as it turns out usually the

1584
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:58,820
non-members with IOT devices all right

1585
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:04,130
when they get when we talk about

1586
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:07,340
architecture equal and XZ card so I can

1587
01:36:04,130 --> 01:36:08,900
buy an XD card cloning or a chip

1588
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:11,180
lengthiest doesn't matter because the

1589
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:13,009
architecture is just the same a bit more

1590
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:15,139
complicated because these

1591
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:18,679
thinner the pins are thinner but the

1592
01:36:15,139 --> 01:36:21,380
architecture says the same so we get

1593
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:24,650
some copper threads and we bind

1594
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:28,130
I don't know pin 13 which is VCC so pin

1595
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:32,000
13 on the non memory to whatever the pin

1596
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:34,429
is on the x-ray reader on the left side

1597
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,619
we have the XD reader and on the right

1598
01:36:34,429 --> 01:36:38,389
side we have this other chip check out

1599
01:36:36,619 --> 01:36:44,000
the size of the chip this is what I have

1600
01:36:38,389 --> 01:36:48,559
here so this is clean Earth on my finger

1601
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:52,369
and we have 24 pins on each side so see

1602
01:36:48,559 --> 01:36:55,010
this degree of a skill needed you know

1603
01:36:52,369 --> 01:36:56,869
the two weld as you see there a thread a

1604
01:36:55,010 --> 01:37:01,150
cup of thread next to another copper

1605
01:36:56,869 --> 01:37:03,710
thread without bridge innate or

1606
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:10,789
short-circuit innate or bypass innate

1607
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:15,949
it's done manually manually and I cannot

1608
01:37:10,789 --> 01:37:17,360
weld this us on the right side I got new

1609
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:20,089
MIT's hell because they have a

1610
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:22,219
microscope and can produce it on the

1611
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:24,800
left side well I can do that as much as

1612
01:37:22,219 --> 01:37:27,710
that but the right side not for me and

1613
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:31,190
if we managed to commit all 17 copper

1614
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:33,320
threats to the XE cards would be like

1615
01:37:31,190 --> 01:37:36,799
plugging a pendrive onto our computer

1616
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:41,570
because our USB feeds the chip the chip

1617
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:44,809
sends and the TV is gonna go off in five

1618
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:48,139
minutes the chips and some information

1619
01:37:44,809 --> 01:37:51,650
and that information is dumped onto the

1620
01:37:48,139 --> 01:37:54,440
computer same as we would get an XT card

1621
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:58,400
and plug it into a reader same here we

1622
01:37:54,440 --> 01:38:00,230
can take the ftk and get the memory chip

1623
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,509
the computer doesn't know there is a

1624
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:05,928
chip on the computer thinks there is as

1625
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:07,340
XD card that is 128 make us furnace

1626
01:38:05,929 --> 01:38:09,500
because the speaking is just the same

1627
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:11,780
and once we have set it up a Linux

1628
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:13,670
system as a one that I've explained

1629
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:15,768
before you see that everything is

1630
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:18,829
repeated over and over these are devices

1631
01:38:15,769 --> 01:38:22,239
that have nothing to do with each other

1632
01:38:18,829 --> 01:38:25,530
but if we now read down to technology is

1633
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:30,370
always the same

1634
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:32,860
what what about now might be that the

1635
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:34,719
Pink's are not exposed on the side so

1636
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:37,150
there's no Weldon it there's no way

1637
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:38,199
around it there's no connection so the

1638
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:41,920
only option left

1639
01:38:38,199 --> 01:38:44,259
left is between chip of so since I

1640
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:47,380
cannot get connected I take the chip out

1641
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:50,949
so take it off and you'd get disposed

1642
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:52,719
pins for connection chip off naturally

1643
01:38:50,949 --> 01:38:55,500
is one of the most complicated

1644
01:38:52,719 --> 01:39:00,130
techniques for forensics in electronics

1645
01:38:55,500 --> 01:39:02,080
process is just the same and within the

1646
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:03,360
board we see what we're interested in

1647
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:06,580
[Music]

1648
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:09,670
there we have the processor the Wi-Fi

1649
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:12,100
Ram whatever we're interested in the

1650
01:39:09,670 --> 01:39:15,250
blue part with the datasheet we found

1651
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:18,429
that blue one is a none memory which is

1652
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:19,780
Toshiba and it's 16 gigs what's worth

1653
01:39:18,429 --> 01:39:21,160
being interested in that memory

1654
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:23,920
everything else we're not interested in

1655
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:28,360
it so what are we doing that ship that

1656
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:32,260
blue memory first we are dissolvent to

1657
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:35,980
remove the any epoxy holy glue because

1658
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:39,040
usually it's not just welding for

1659
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:40,839
corruption corrosion sorry we use epoxy

1660
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:42,160
but epoxy forensically speaking is a

1661
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:44,880
problem because we cannot interact with

1662
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:47,440
it so we need to use some solvent to

1663
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:49,030
degrade it it is a problem because it's

1664
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:54,040
very taxing so we need to be very

1665
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:58,570
careful have an some ventilation for gas

1666
01:39:54,040 --> 01:40:00,250
of equation or second and so that we are

1667
01:39:58,570 --> 01:40:02,080
not in problem then temperature

1668
01:40:00,250 --> 01:40:05,370
protection there will be a temperature

1669
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:09,940
attack a heat attack rather so we use a

1670
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:12,760
tape and so you get everything but the

1671
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:14,139
memory so once the chip is covered or

1672
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:18,730
rather the board discovered everything

1673
01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:21,820
but the chip simply with a heat plate we

1674
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:25,330
increased the temperature so it all

1675
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:27,340
melts at 190 we wanted to melt but not

1676
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:31,480
the play that the board we don't want it

1677
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:33,850
to explode so we add a heat curve so

1678
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:37,409
that it goes up I need it all heats up

1679
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:41,099
and when it goes as high as 200 210

1680
01:40:37,409 --> 01:40:44,280
hundred-twenty that that was bringing it

1681
01:40:41,099 --> 01:40:46,139
together get smelted and with suction

1682
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:49,829
cup of whatever we can get it out and

1683
01:40:46,139 --> 01:40:52,380
you have it there and it is already out

1684
01:40:49,829 --> 01:40:53,699
we have the cheap offered with remove

1685
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:56,760
the tin and that's it

1686
01:40:53,699 --> 01:41:00,239
we only have a black piece out of the

1687
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:01,499
board and then depending on the kind of

1688
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:03,829
the chip we can do something else

1689
01:41:01,499 --> 01:41:06,570
basically what it means is that if we

1690
01:41:03,829 --> 01:41:10,709
forcefully remove the team part of the

1691
01:41:06,570 --> 01:41:13,289
team beads can be on the chip side or on

1692
01:41:10,709 --> 01:41:15,059
the plates a board side we want them all

1693
01:41:13,289 --> 01:41:17,518
on the cheap side because we will have

1694
01:41:15,059 --> 01:41:19,139
to connect it afterwards usually for

1695
01:41:17,519 --> 01:41:21,780
France that's not necessary but if

1696
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:24,030
needed we also have other plates or

1697
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:26,699
boards where you can use the paste and

1698
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:29,249
it's as good as new and what do we do

1699
01:41:26,699 --> 01:41:35,428
with that chip that is outside we

1700
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:39,800
connect it to a smart card reader but

1701
01:41:35,429 --> 01:41:39,800
instead is this touch screen

1702
01:41:49,900 --> 01:42:08,420
what should I do okay you're the one to

1703
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:14,860
make sure that doesn't turn off Sonya

1704
01:42:08,420 --> 01:42:14,860
how come I to be pleased okay I move on

1705
01:42:15,010 --> 01:42:22,700
okay plain at least I see what we can

1706
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:24,769
see now I'm about to finish here but

1707
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:26,840
basically when we connected to a river

1708
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:31,310
back to the previous parameters we have

1709
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:33,470
a memory a numb memory on a computer the

1710
01:42:31,310 --> 01:42:37,040
computers in a print drive which is 16

1711
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:39,050
gigs that's all we connect that to the

1712
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:41,060
computer which is a sock which is

1713
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:43,820
computer grace it's compatible with the

1714
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:45,590
chip and it reads okay there is a 16gb

1715
01:42:43,820 --> 01:42:48,290
pendrive what do you want to do I want

1716
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:50,510
to open it with ftk we have the analysis

1717
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:55,100
they mentioned whatever simple as that

1718
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:56,930
simple for the logical terms for fck but

1719
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:59,660
it's very very complicated for the

1720
01:42:56,930 --> 01:43:02,030
physical side of removing the chip with

1721
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:04,460
that it being broken or falling into the

1722
01:43:02,030 --> 01:43:06,860
floor without anything weird going on

1723
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:09,980
and just like that any kind of an

1724
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:12,860
electronic device we will be able to

1725
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:15,230
dump it and extract the memory that

1726
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:16,910
might be in it it isn't easy but

1727
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:21,259
sometimes it's the only way to get

1728
01:43:16,910 --> 01:43:23,330
information from those devices as far as

1729
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:25,910
I know they are not encrypted so the

1730
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:29,180
information in it is fully accessible so

1731
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:31,700
phone that well my base I've encrypted

1732
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:34,130
and some other things that need it so

1733
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:37,760
you just like in the hard drive and you

1734
01:43:34,130 --> 01:43:38,960
can see everything in it and I'm now

1735
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,840
coming to conclusions

1736
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:44,150
I didn't mean to explain to you how to

1737
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:46,700
look into thousand of devices we have a

1738
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:48,710
bunch of devices here this is looking

1739
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:52,099
you can analyze it like this like that

1740
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:54,620
but as part of that men's of devices I

1741
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:56,300
want to give you a protocol within our

1742
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:59,150
possibilities so that you have other

1743
01:43:56,300 --> 01:44:01,149
forensics or learn about forensics what

1744
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:05,598
techniques will be more interest

1745
01:44:01,149 --> 01:44:08,059
efficient when conducting some forensics

1746
01:44:05,599 --> 01:44:11,659
that would be an analysis procedure as I

1747
01:44:08,059 --> 01:44:13,699
said we don't have an IOT and forensic

1748
01:44:11,659 --> 01:44:16,699
analysis I said when we started out I

1749
01:44:13,699 --> 01:44:18,879
didn't mean to set it for you but I want

1750
01:44:16,699 --> 01:44:21,919
you to understand what it would be like

1751
01:44:18,879 --> 01:44:25,909
problem is about investing money that's

1752
01:44:21,919 --> 01:44:27,709
what it takes for that looking smart

1753
01:44:25,909 --> 01:44:30,018
Black is not very complicated but a

1754
01:44:27,709 --> 01:44:32,090
drone may be there we need to buy a

1755
01:44:30,019 --> 01:44:34,429
device at my cost five thousand six

1756
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:37,849
thousand years if we cannot do it

1757
01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:41,209
manually or if we need the sucker to

1758
01:44:37,849 --> 01:44:45,679
like it on for the chip of does cost

1759
01:44:41,209 --> 01:44:49,340
money so we need to invest money and we

1760
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:51,530
also need to have other idea we cannot

1761
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:53,119
think well this is step one step two you

1762
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:54,919
on the internet that's not like that

1763
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:57,499
because this is working today but

1764
01:44:54,919 --> 01:44:59,269
tomorrow there's a firmware update in

1765
01:44:57,499 --> 01:45:02,749
everything changes we need to start a

1766
01:44:59,269 --> 01:45:05,449
name so that we need to have that idea

1767
01:45:02,749 --> 01:45:06,858
to understand what the oceans are and

1768
01:45:05,449 --> 01:45:07,759
what's not working today might be

1769
01:45:06,859 --> 01:45:10,039
working tomorrow

1770
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:12,320
and what's pointless today may be very

1771
01:45:10,039 --> 01:45:15,079
useful tomorrow to clarify all kinds of

1772
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:19,759
investigation or anything we have to do

1773
01:45:15,079 --> 01:45:21,679
and then we need to be very skilled very

1774
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:24,649
skilled sometimes these are destructive

1775
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:26,869
techniques a chip off on the device well

1776
01:45:24,649 --> 01:45:29,209
it can be quite destructive because it

1777
01:45:26,869 --> 01:45:31,999
might be that we can never connect that

1778
01:45:29,209 --> 01:45:35,898
chip to that board where it was there

1779
01:45:31,999 --> 01:45:38,269
can be damages or there was overheating

1780
01:45:35,899 --> 01:45:40,039
and something came loose those are

1781
01:45:38,269 --> 01:45:40,939
destructive techniques where we only get

1782
01:45:40,039 --> 01:45:44,329
one chance

1783
01:45:40,939 --> 01:45:46,699
we're all happy and quiet and but at a

1784
01:45:44,329 --> 01:45:49,099
forensic lab when you're told that in

1785
01:45:46,699 --> 01:45:50,959
order to clarify the other way the only

1786
01:45:49,099 --> 01:45:52,429
way around uses these and you only get a

1787
01:45:50,959 --> 01:45:57,639
chance and you know that if you make a

1788
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:59,599
mistake you will bring to an end an

1789
01:45:57,639 --> 01:46:01,219
investigation of several years of

1790
01:45:59,599 --> 01:46:02,959
duration is not the same prison as we

1791
01:46:01,219 --> 01:46:05,479
have here today that's why we need to

1792
01:46:02,959 --> 01:46:09,800
truly control that source of a stress

1793
01:46:05,479 --> 01:46:12,409
when we do this kind of an analysis and

1794
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:13,540
I think it's been all for me between two

1795
01:46:12,409 --> 01:46:15,940
hours

1796
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:18,580
thank you very much to all of you for

1797
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:34,650
being with me and it's been a pleasure

1798
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:34,650
thank you are there any questions

1799
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:10,430
insane dental economy wish he was trying

1800
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:20,000
to log on to my Wi-Fi someone on the

1801
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:22,820
front row I'm assuming sure sure not a

1802
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:29,270
question but a remark it is pretty

1803
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:32,290
difficult in Malaga explaining forensics

1804
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:36,560
to a judge or a notary public

1805
01:47:32,290 --> 01:47:39,620
explain what digital footprint is or

1806
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:44,740
chain of custody is so short midterm how

1807
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:44,740
would you explain a judge how to

1808
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:53,900
investigator the smart plug all the hard

1809
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:56,660
technique one I'm at an advantage here

1810
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:59,599
we have a prosecutor with us that can

1811
01:47:56,660 --> 01:48:02,180
attest to you the veracity of what's

1812
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:04,130
going on and ask lurks we have that

1813
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:06,200
value I get what you say this is

1814
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:09,590
complicated it is because they're not

1815
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:13,790
Republic yes they might understand or

1816
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:17,470
not would it means to you ran a kebab or

1817
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:21,670
deciphering an iPhone it is complicated

1818
01:48:17,470 --> 01:48:25,150
solution no clue whatsoever

1819
01:48:21,670 --> 01:48:28,940
thank you to be honest

1820
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:31,370
but but I see it is not a future problem

1821
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:34,370
but present problem nowadays we are

1822
01:48:31,370 --> 01:48:38,090
conducting forensic analysis and there

1823
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:40,610
is an IT expert used to ensure well the

1824
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:43,760
expert needs to have some kind of surety

1825
01:48:40,610 --> 01:48:45,110
procedure features skills and that's why

1826
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:50,330
they are an expert and not something

1827
01:48:45,110 --> 01:48:51,549
else but I guess that the weather

1828
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:54,440
releases he lies

1829
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:57,920
whoever's done it someone who is skilled

1830
01:48:54,440 --> 01:49:00,730
enough knowledgeable enough that will

1831
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:04,940
give a statement just saying the truth

1832
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:06,320
if they don't stick to the truth then

1833
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:08,559
they will be in trouble but that's

1834
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:13,990
something different

1835
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:15,730
is there another question all right we

1836
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:17,599
are told we are out of time thank you

1837
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:20,699
very much for everything thank you

1838
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:20,699
