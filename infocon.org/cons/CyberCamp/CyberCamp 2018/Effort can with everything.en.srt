2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:15,289
and the girl gracias Allah first of all

3
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:17,540
I would like to thank the organizers for

4
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:22,009
inviting me to be here and before the

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,900
closing ceremony I'm going to speak well

6
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:27,770
I've seen many young people here that I

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:33,140
started in cybersecurity this summary of

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:37,879
my CV basically shows that them old and

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:40,790
I have done lots of things I talked

10
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:44,440
about this with Eduardo before and cyber

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,440
camp would speak about cybersecurity

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:51,289
presence of security if we want to get

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:55,669
far in this world I could have taken him

14
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:57,920
I can tell and perhaps many people are

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:00,350
watching us from home and perhaps many

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,649
young people would have stayed but those

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,380
of you who have stayed should have

18
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:09,530
stayed in order to know that

19
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,690
cybersecurity has a big human factor

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:18,049
thanks to that human factor we usually

21
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:21,860
forget about thanks to that now when we

22
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:25,610
are 16 17 18 years old our technical

23
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,950
skills are highly valued but at some

24
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,509
point in life besides our technical

25
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,329
skills that we're going to be valued due

26
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:34,460
to what we can offer as human beings and

27
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:37,460
how we can get will depend on what we

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,009
offer and what we are as human beings in

29
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:44,809
cybersecurity the technical side of

30
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:45,409
human side our hand in hand go hand in

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,109
hand

32
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:53,020
this talk is not technical it's very

33
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:53,020
personal please allow me a few minutes

34
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,440
I'll give you some piece of biased

35
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,930
because I'm all with not because I'm

36
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,810
very smart because in life there's

37
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,870
something that always works and I'll

38
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,670
explain that later I always say that you

39
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:10,640
can do everything with a lot of effort

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,850
you may be very intelligent we may you

41
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,859
may win many CTFs you may be able to

42
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,410
hide many devices you may create the

43
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,870
best tools but if your human side does

44
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,150
not work at some point here to stay

45
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,460
behind and you will not fulfill your

46
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,820
dreams because there's a reason for

47
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,260
everything in life

48
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:33,620
I've already been introduced I don't

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,730
want to bore you if you pay if you take

50
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,670
a look at this letter

51
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:42,950
this was my book I don't want to sell it

52
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:46,040
it was perish and 21st of June 2018 this

53
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,510
let him was sent by me to a publishing

54
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,780
house called teaming mass which belongs

55
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:55,910
to Planeta dated on 9th in 1992 26 years

56
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,090
ago and I was with telling them that I

57
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:03,950
sent them a poem I was 15 and sent them

58
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:05,810
a poem I guess it was someone there the

59
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,260
secretary said thank you very much for

60
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,390
your poem it's very beautiful who knows

61
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,459
whether perhaps we'll it will be

62
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:19,298
published by us best regards Martha lay

63
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:22,150
keep on writing 26 years later published

64
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,939
my first book with Pineda

65
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,650
what do I mean with all this what's

66
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:30,760
there between that fifteen-year-old

67
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,170
Gerda dreamed of being a writer 20 years

68
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,328
later she publishes a book with that

69
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,488
doesn't mean that I was the best writer

70
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:38,590
in the world no I just had a dream and I

71
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:43,019
worked very hard to fulfill it to make

72
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:47,859
it real effort effort without control is

73
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:49,930
worthless perhaps you are very eager and

74
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,670
I've done that you want to do the lots

75
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,790
of things but if you don't plan if you

76
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:59,078
didn't have strategy if you get stressed

77
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,578
in the end you'll fail I remember back

78
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,889
then when I was 16

79
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:06,389
yesterday occasionally I used to study I

80
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:10,840
was at high school we had a vacation or

81
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:12,280
couch we talked to her and we said I

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,760
don't know what to do with my life now

83
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,849
you can do it and goggle Google Suggest

84
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,279
thing but in the past we had no internet

85
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:26,020
we had no Google so when you were lost

86
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:33,130
when you didn't know what to do you were

87
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:34,780
sent to the coach and they asked you

88
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,110
what do you want to do in life

89
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,119
and I I told her well I don't know what

90
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,310
to do with my life and she said well we

91
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,750
were 16 you should know because in one

92
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,520
year you are going to choose your

93
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,210
studies so instead of orientating you

94
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:56,020
you were disoriented there were not

95
00:04:52,210 --> 00:05:01,979
tutorials on YouTube explaining things

96
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:04,990
there was nothing just a professional

97
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:10,030
that was supposed to orient to you and

98
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:13,720
he did it I speak four languages back

99
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,669
then I spoke Spanish English French

100
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,669
Latin Greek I said

101
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:21,190
teacher I know what to do with my life I

102
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,260
want to study classical languages and

103
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,259
she looked at me yes you're very good at

104
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:30,229
languages you write very good you

105
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:31,850
you speak very well but you you could

106
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:36,880
die of starvation you want to make a

107
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:41,120
living out of it but our parents even

108
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,550
though we had a good marks my mother

109
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,539
always said she doesn't want to study

110
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:49,490
just lazy but I had many I was very

111
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:52,750
curious and now the other side

112
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,400
I I was so had a brother who was

113
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,050
aeronautical engineer he has studied for

114
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,090
eight years to get his degree at

115
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,740
University eight years to know how

116
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:06,619
automatic pilot works I saw him every

117
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:10,430
night three years studying and I was

118
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:15,380
coming brought back from party the next

119
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:18,050
morning he was studying and I said okay

120
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,940
being an engineer I'm not going to spend

121
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:25,010
eight years like that eight years for

122
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:28,940
what I said I don't want this

123
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:31,550
so I started to try some things with

124
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:36,530
computing there were not YouTube

125
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:40,880
tutorials there was nothing to start

126
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:45,729
with how do you have your own computer

127
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:51,490
your own CPU how to dismantle a CPU I

128
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:54,650
bought this book i dismantled his PC I

129
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:59,350
put it back together and didn't work I

130
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:05,690
loved that and left there was my first

131
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:07,850
contact with the IT world I've destroyed

132
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,770
my brother's engineer the poor engineer

133
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,030
that started for 80 years so this two

134
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:18,049
things combination

135
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:20,710
I said well science is not for me and I

136
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,870
said I'm going to publish this and

137
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,900
social media but there was no what's up

138
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:30,110

139
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,390
do with my life and you feel really bad

140
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:37,730
when you don't know what to do with your

141
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:39,560
life I was 19 one person lady told me

142
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,860
that languages was not a good idea my

143
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,910
brother has been studied for 8 years he

144
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,510

146
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,190

147
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:57,820
social media what do I do

148
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:57,820
I didn't know what to do with my life

149
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:11,620
what do I do so I joined the military

150
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:14,950
something logic what do you do if you do

151
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:18,160
the military service five years in which

152
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:24,219
I had a hard time I was very useful to

153
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:27,670
have discipline and to think to go to

154
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:31,390
the thinking corner five years you're

155
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:35,710
receiving the hitting you everywhere so

156
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:37,510
you think about lots of things I was in

157
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,610
the military for five years this that's

158
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:44,610
why when I left I'm an expert in tying

159
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,610
knots

160
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:55,689
I was going to become a policewoman and

161
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,990
I learned how to tie a knot what did I

162
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,160
do

163
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:05,079
I ended up with the police force I

164
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,730
didn't plan anything and being a

165
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:09,430
military woman I realized I liked

166
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,950
helping people and that's why I ended

167
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:16,420
I'm the police force and I discovered a

168
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:22,300
new world a world that fulfills me where

169
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:26,130
you risk your life where you gave help

170
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:29,769
other people and I've been very happy

171
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:33,040
this is advice I can give you to tell

172
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:36,010
you that you should never miss an

173
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,040
opportunity don't listen to people that

174
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:42,010
tell you this is not listen right for

175
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,279
you there are no professional exits here

176
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:47,920
many people do these that do what you

177
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,700
like doing do whatever you like doing

178
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,740
I'm the only police woman the only

179
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,709
member of police forces in my life I

180
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:01,180
didn't care I want to do that and I

181
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:04,989
learned a lot and why did I ended up in

182
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,579
the units of technological investigation

183
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,040
and I just covered my vacation his

184
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:12,339
provocation being a policewoman either

185
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,399
knew my vocation is cybersecurity ladies

186
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:19,029
and gentlemen cyber security I was a I

187
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,430
was 25 years old I reached this unit I

188
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:21,760
arrived to this unit and back then the

189
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,609
wars

190
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,040
social the way social media Facebook

191
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,010
existed and I discovered that type of

192
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,819
security was my real vocation you don't

193
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,449
need to be a hugger

194
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:37,149
8:14 many of you you're huggers today

195
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:40,329
and perhaps in five ten years time

196
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:42,790
you're electricians you never know you

197
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:46,599
never know here I discovered my true

198
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,759
vocation and after that

199
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,389
happened when I joined the police force

200
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:54,490
I saw that in order to carry out my

201
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:56,380
investigations to have more

202
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,190
responsibilities to continue growing and

203
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,860
had to study and become a detective I I

204
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:06,610
do it like everyone I took an

205
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,850
examination I combined my job and my

206
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:13,660
personal life oh my not personal not so

207
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:15,670
personal life because I remember my

208
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,550
brother starting for eight years well I

209
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,899
studied for 12 and I used to laugh at my

210
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:25,089
brother poor guy

211
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:28,870
and I realized over the years I was

212
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:30,940
telling him to become a detective it was

213
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,220
a hard time for me I was fighting

214
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,540
against myself from a personal point of

215
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,569
view I said no to everything I just

216
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:42,660
worked and studied that's it I had a

217
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:47,860
dream which was being a detective and

218
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:50,740
many colleagues said don't do that this

219
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,769
is subject to nepotism this is for the

220
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,860
detectives children well my father is

221
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:58,689
not a detective my father was a builder

222
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,970
within the construction industry and I

223
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:07,329
got the position it wasn't easy

224
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:10,240
the third year I failed if I've ever

225
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:11,739
faced this type of process you know how

226
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,319
hard it is when you fail you have to

227
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,520
start all over again so when I fell it

228
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:22,819
for the third time

229
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:27,620
I was I at least hair was a bit bored

230
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:31,070
had skin problems and I remember sitting

231
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:35,870
down in my room

232
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:39,530
aged 35 32 well I'm 32 I cannot be a

233
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,840
detective because I can't because I'm

234
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:44,540
not good enough for that and it's true

235
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,760
other people say that this is for

236
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:51,500
detective children is it true maybe it's

237
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:55,670
true and at that point when my mother

238
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:58,040
came in she said well perhaps this is

239
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,829
not for you yes it is for me it's what I

240
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,560
want to be I want to be a detective

241
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:07,790
I want to take the cuts the bad guys I

242
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:15,500
want to go back to the uit there was my

243
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:18,500
dream he seconds later I got up I wrote

244
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:22,160
some motivational quotes and I realized

245
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,820
that what what makes us different is

246
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,620
this I am given a talk without shoes

247
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:32,210
barefoot why why should I wear shoes

248
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,790
when I'm here because other people say

249
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:38,990
that what we should do is reach in

250
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,699
places or other people don't it's all

251
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:45,170
people don't greet that should give us

252
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:48,140
strength in order to know that we can do

253
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,569
things people instill limiting thoughts

254
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,250
into our heads we can do whatever we

255
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,430
want

256
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:58,329
well I'm just checking what do we need

257
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:04,959
to do in order to be successful

258
00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:07,128
and high school they teach you that the

259
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,229
formula in order to be successful has

260
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:14,600
already been invented besides learning

261
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:18,079
lots of things studying you need effort

262
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,670
vocation and patience because patience

263
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,739
as we say in Spanish is the mother of

264
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,870
every science that's a key for success

265
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,750
you don't need to be more or less

266
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,910
intelligent if you're intelligent you

267
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,560
put some effort and your patience you

268
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:33,800
can do whatever you want

269
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:40,069
I can assure you that we don't have much

270
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:42,949
time but I'm going to give here's some

271
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:44,599
piece of advice perhaps because I've

272
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:47,359
done some things in life which were

273
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,300
difficult and I'm old enough you have to

274
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,000
look at opportunities no one's give you

275
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:58,099
anything for free no one came to from

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:01,819
Canada to tell me write something in one

277
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:05,149
year I published 150 papers in a

278
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:09,979
thousand blogs everywhere I published

279
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:13,009
every week I didn't go out on the

280
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,380
weekends I just stay home writing until

281
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:18,620
you get your opportunity you have to do

282
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:21,019
something you may be at home you may be

283
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,329
the first the best technical person in

284
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:26,269
the world but no one's going to look for

285
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:27,920
you no one's going to come looking for

286
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:33,949
you you need to look for your

287
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:35,899
opportunities make yourself you have to

288
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:38,899
see yourself where you want to reach I

289
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:41,269
saw myself as a detective I saw myself

290
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:44,809
you have to visualize where you we want

291
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:48,740
why you want to be it has to be in your

292
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:51,529
mind your brain thinks in images when we

293
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:56,720
smell a perfume we have a feeling we'll

294
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:58,759
remember something when we go to the sea

295
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,819
and we smell something we go to Madrid

296
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,380
with smelled pollution our success

297
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:05,300
should be in images here

298
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,600
if you consider that tomorrow you're

299
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:13,810
going to be the best hackers you should

300
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:17,360
see it here it's in your power

301
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:22,189
competitive 'ti now everything is more

302
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:28,520
complicated thanks to the Internet

303
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:32,120
now we can have full languages 18

304
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:35,600
degrees masters you may be indebted in

305
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,610
order to train and to have a

306
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,070
qualification we're very competitive you

307
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:44,510
need to look for something that makes

308
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:46,970
you different if you know that cyber

309
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,819
security is a very complex world a very

310
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,070
wide world you cannot be the best at

311
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,660
everything you have to say I have my

312
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:58,430
technical limitations mental limitations

313
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:02,089
to be technical and someone asked me

314
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:04,639
someone well everyone knows about you in

315
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,500
Spain so talk about this we'll have FFN

316
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,760
not good at that I'm not going to do it

317
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,780
you need to look for something that

318
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,940
makes you different

319
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:16,190
why because if you're different in that

320
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:20,690
you can do that otherwise do you you

321
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:23,330
will be just someone else go for what

322
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,970
you want and don't let other people's

323
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:29,590
limiting thought thoughts to block you

324
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,590
you have to keep going

325
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,330
I haven't tweeted and I'm here at

326
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:39,509
Cybercom talking at cyber gums

327
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:42,418
sometimes people tell brag about things

328
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:48,119
in social media and their lives the real

intelligent she speaks very well I'm

333
00:17:57,029 --> 00:18:03,179
here thanks Gigi social to social media

334
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:06,330
published every day every day I worked

335
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:08,999
hard and I published my work my

336
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,730
colleagues work too but my work use

337
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:14,580
social media with strategy because

338
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:18,090
social media will take you to places

339
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:20,279
such as myself I if I just depended on

340
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,100
my bosses my superiors I would have

341
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:28,259
never been here because they want to

342
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:31,139
make my successes of this don't be

343
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:33,690
demoralized about the cool life or the

344
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:35,850
people who have don't believe social

345
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:41,210
media you have to believe in your own

346
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:45,269
capabilities you cannot generate high

347
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:49,019
expectations so step by step you win a

348
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:52,190
league by getting points three points

349
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:55,440
after three points and each match

350
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:58,470
matches don't generate too high

351
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,659
expectations you may think that would

352
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:03,269
you do everyday doesn't add but

353
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:07,639
yesterday talk is important yesterday's

354
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:10,440
talk was important everything matters

355
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:14,998
there will always be someone with wish

356
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:18,779
which who wishes you know good it

357
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:21,360
doesn't matter how good you are how

358
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:27,090
could you principles are someone will be

359
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:29,719
jealous envy someone will wishes bad

360
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:32,668
things because people are jealous and

361
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,190
miracles so we shouldn't wait for people

362
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:37,799
to tap us on our shoulder sometimes yes

363
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,220
and we're thankful for that but has to

364
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,710
be within us

365
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:46,270
you cannot think okay I did good things

366
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:49,240
I do everything I did for everything why

367
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:52,120
do people treat me like this because

368
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,570
there will be people that wish you no

369
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,899
good because otherwise we'll all be here

370
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,730
here are people who we adore and people

371
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,070
that has no effect on a ship here

372
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,470
[Music]

373
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:08,439
acknowledgments are very good a word

374
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,150
taps no shoulder or back it's not as

375
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,990
when they give you a big round of

376
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:18,460
applause and thinking I'm so good but

377
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:22,950

professional stop it's okay I learned

381
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:38,169
from my mistakes I'm not going to sit

382
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:39,900
down and think oh people are so evil but

383
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:41,860
you learn from your mistakes

384
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:46,570
acknowledgments are ok to know that

385
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:50,580
you're doing you in the right way but

386
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,580
that's it that's it

387
00:20:51,369 --> 00:20:58,939
cheers your principals choose who you

388
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,549
want around you if you're surrounded by

389
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:04,340
mediocre people you'll be mediocre if

390
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:10,099
you if you surrounded by brilliant

391
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:12,459
people you'll have that media crew

392
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:15,259
people will never allow you to be there

393
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,149
people who allow you to be there will be

394
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:19,070
people who actually want you to be there

395
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:20,869
so choose your principals do you want to

396
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:25,158
work for money well don't complain if

397
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:28,009
you get treated a badly if people over

398
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:31,639
you are making your lives impossible you

399
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:34,450
sold yourself for money if you want to

400
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:37,158
do what you like

401
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:42,710
you will probably do fine we'll need

402
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:45,859
money for things in life I left the

403
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,789
police I had a good salary to be an

404
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:49,129
entrepreneur

405
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:53,479
perhaps I'd trust myself and my

406
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:58,789
possibilities what about cases of

407
00:21:53,479 --> 00:22:01,070
success jet vs. Mark Zuckerberg don't

408
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:04,399
use them as a reference you have to be

409
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:07,099
happy you need daily life you want to be

410
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:09,649
here you come up first second third at

411
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:13,720
city if that's already a success forget

412
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:18,049
about Amazon Aliexpress or Facebook

413
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:20,599
that's what people want to sell to us

414
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:23,899
cheap philosophy how many people reach

415
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:26,749
that one among how many people that are

416
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:31,478
really poor well at cases of success if

417
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:36,590
you hear you hear because you want to be

418
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:40,340
doing what you want that success being

419
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,349
here on stage to speak about this that's

420
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,019
a success for me I don't need to be Mark

421
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:48,320
Zuckerberg or having a few beers with my

422
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:51,470
best friends that's a success great

423
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:57,678
projects are made of people

424
00:22:51,470 --> 00:23:01,460
it big projects are based on people what

425
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,520
people offer if she can't offer

426
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:07,760
something he would do

427
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,639
people make projects grow we don't it

428
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,270
process with need leaders and big

429
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:18,950
projects are made of people that's why

430
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:21,620
the 99% of companies that are created

431
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,130
fail because they don't have money no

432
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:27,110
because people do not create a group big

433
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:30,710
projects are made of people

434
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:36,709
everything you provide adds things adds

435
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:40,150
value surround you with talent and

436
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,590
motivation people who like what they do

437
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:47,750
because if you're surrounded by negative

438
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:50,090
things it would be contagion and you

439
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:53,230
have negative people around you what

440
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:56,918
isolate yourself think about your path

441
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:02,450
be surrounded by talent and motivation

442
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:05,950
that's doing what you like and be with

443
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:08,419
people was like you and you'll be fine

444
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,909
it's great to read motivational books

445
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:12,799
but your motivation comes from here you

446
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:18,530
need to believe in this that I'm telling

447
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:21,020
you because it's useful my father was in

448
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,530
the building industry my mother was a

449
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,250
woman

450
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:28,700
heis wife and I made it when you reached

451
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:33,860
here you'll be by ourselves the more you

452
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:38,299
grow the lowly or you be when people

453
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:42,090
don't know you people tell you how

454
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:45,100
you're great but when you go up

455
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:49,360
you're by yourself because people become

456
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:51,520
envious and jealous why because you did

457
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,969
things right so motivation comes from

458
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:57,690
here not from there and the difficult

459
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:01,240
thing is not being successful is

460
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:05,710
maintaining the success I'm not Fred

461
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,390
about being successful I'm afraid that

462
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:14,260
the expectation is generate have to be

463
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:17,800
kept when people introduce me people the

464
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,480
audience expects me to keep a certain

465
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,450
level of qualities and once you've

466
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:26,190
reached what you wanted you have to keep

467
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:32,050
on working hard you have to maintain

468
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:34,780
that situation last but not least be

469
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:37,330
humble and never stop learning you learn

470
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,730
from people who have just come to the

471
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:41,919
company everything has something to

472
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,290
offer if I'm here it's not because I'm

473
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,600
more intelligent I'm older perhaps I was

474
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:49,330
more lucky I did things better but never

475
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,550
stopped learning even the youngest

476
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:55,300
person has something to show you

477
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:58,178
to teach you and then don't be afraid of

478
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:03,370
change change is always positive what

479
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:06,429
can I say I've quit my position as an

480
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:08,800
employee to become an entrepreneur it's

481
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:12,610
okay you always have to try something

482
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:15,850
new so I'd like to encourage you to use

483
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:19,750

486
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,869
