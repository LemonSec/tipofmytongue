00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:19,480
Cadell yeah good morning welcome back I

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,520
forgot to thank mikela to death for his

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,980
fantastic presentation and now we're

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,500
going to be hearing from Pedro Perez

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:35,050
Lopez who was also selected for the J n

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:38,280
IC seminar the event which in Spain is

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:42,790
the benchmark for cybersecurity

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,330
researchers and organize together with

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,220
in civic as well to promote a R&D and I

11
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:53,110
and this particular presentation today

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:55,299
was selected for that event he's going

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:59,140
to tell us on how electro cardiogram

14
00:00:55,299 --> 00:01:01,900
systems ECG systems and those streams

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:07,960
data streams can help for continues

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:11,470
authentication good morning thank you

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,570
very much for that kind introduction

18
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,170
I'm going to start with a little bit of

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:21,548
background about myself my name is Pedro

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:26,499
pedis I I am a lecturer at the Carlos

21
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:33,189
the third University and I work with

22
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:37,979
cyber security in health and lately very

23
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:42,568
much as well with a implanted systems

24
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:46,658
for health together with Carmen camera

25
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:50,409
one of the co-authors of the piece of

26
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:53,649
research that was the start for this

27
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:56,799
presentation she's currently doing

28
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:59,229
research in Oxford which is why I'm here

29
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,249
on her behalf to deliver this

30
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:07,689
presentation so let me start with what I

31
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:10,008
call our motivation why is it that we've

32
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,829
been doing this type of work

33
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:15,980
and I just want you to understand first

34
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,269
what we mean by implantable medical

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:23,060
devices

36
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:26,470
I am DS you've probably been reading in

37
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:30,620
the press they so called a implant

38
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:34,549
reports or that controversy is this

39
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:38,840
connected with that scandal or not well

40
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:43,610
we'll see about that what is an IMD it's

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:47,470
a device implanted that means that I

42
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,599
would carry it in my body permanently

43
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:54,709
although there are systems were part of

44
00:02:50,599 --> 00:03:01,220
the system is implanted and part is worn

45
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:03,489
not actually implanted in the body what

46
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,709
do they treat well very often

47
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:13,280
cardiovascular pathology or when there

48
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:16,630
is a severe tremor and why are they

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,209
these devices implanted because of

50
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:25,310
treatment purposes plus we can then

51
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:28,250
monitor continuously the patient and in

52
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,250
future those individuals will not just

53
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:35,180
be monitored but also a new capacities

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:38,930
egg will be added who knows improving

55
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:42,319
memory for instance in Alzheimer's

56
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,130
patients for instance why is this good

57
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,518
or bad

58
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,349
positive or negative after listening to

59
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,840
Mikkel he was telling us about

60
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:53,238
industrial environments what's the

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,109
difference in this case well in this

62
00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:00,500
case were not talking so much about

63
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:03,139
security but safety individual patient

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,530
safety that would be the core for us

65
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:10,069
that would be our main purpose keeping

66
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:13,910
the patient alive so please remember

67
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:15,470
that during my presentation and bear in

68
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,168
mind as well that we're talking about

69
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,139
electronic devices that can also be

70
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:22,729
attacked

71
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:27,990
for instance the FDA in the u.s. clearly

72
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:32,729
state these devices and systems can also

73
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:35,699
be attacked so what should be done what

74
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:38,930
should manufacturers do to improve

75
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:42,319
security and safety of these devices

76
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:45,360
logically safety and security should be

77
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:49,169
included from the beginning of the

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,050
design what was wrong about the internet

79
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:55,560
to start off with it gives us all these

80
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,439
new possibilities and capacities but it

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,250
wasn't terribly secure to start off with

82
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:06,060
which is why we need to patch it up time

83
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,189
and time again so these new technologies

84
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,729
and systems

85
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:14,550
that's what's been done in the past

86
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:17,039
they've been patched up which is not

87
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:21,240
great because we're not just talking

88
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:24,419
about a IT security but individual

89
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,300
personal safety that's critical isn't it

90
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:29,609
I would also like you to pay remind

91
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,740
during my presentation that I'm not

92
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,300
going to be talking about

93
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,839
science-fiction but about systems and

94
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:42,319
devices that are currently used by many

95
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:45,930
people so implantable medical devices

96
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:48,270
IMD's what's the background what's been

97
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:53,490
done in the past what does the future

98
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:56,909
look like here we can see a time line up

99
00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:01,409
on the screen the first pacemaker was

100
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:06,839
the first implanted when quite a long

101
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:10,289
time ago in 1926 there was the first

102
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:12,930
proposal for something like a pacemaker

103
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:16,620
was there an implantable device it

104
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:21,560
wasn't look at that poor patient with

105
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:25,430
all those gadgets around around him

106
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:29,490
one of the main landmarks was in the

107
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:34,439
1960s when the first devices that were

108
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:41,060
still pretty big we're still were small

109
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:44,340
enough to be implanted truly implanted

110
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:48,150
there will be other landmarks but let's

111
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:51,169
move on to 2006 which which is when

112
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:55,580
wireless connectivity was first

113
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:59,818
incorporated so implantable devices with

114
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:03,180
wireless connectivity as a huge paradigm

115
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:06,539
shift previous devices couldn't

116
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:11,210
communicate with the environment unless

117
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:11,210
you were in a very very short range

118
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:18,419
there are many different devices for

119
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,460
instance pacemakers that the ones that

120
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:26,549
are best known why because they were the

121
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,508
first ones to come and also because

122
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:34,469
thinking about pathologies that humans

123
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:38,219
suffer cardiovascular pathology is by

124
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:42,029
far but not by far one of the most

125
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:47,819
common pathologies that would require

126
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:51,900
these devices then other devices in this

127
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:54,180
group would be neuro simulators the

128
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:59,818
difference here is that catheters should

129
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:02,550
call them wires in this case go to a

130
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,759
particular type of the brain depending

131
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:10,440
on what you need the main difference

132
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,960
between pacemakers and neuro simulators

133
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:19,350
is that neuro simulators are a little

134
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:22,599
bit dumb compared to pacemakers they

135
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:25,360
transmit a current to that particular

136
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,930
whatever type of the brain part of the

137
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,810
brain whereas the pacemaker monitors

138
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:35,740
your heart so that when it goes too fast

139
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:39,099
or too slow only then there and then it

140
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,909
will act nearest emulators are

141
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:46,750
differently mostly because of our level

142
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:50,620
of knowledge of the human body we know

143
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:55,170
how the heart works better much better

144
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:58,330
than the brain so we can simulate us

145
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:06,699
much more easily to then diminish

146
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:09,370
certain symptoms not constantly and then

147
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:13,120
I have here up on the screen insulin

148
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,310
pumps we know that these devices are

149
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,450
becoming much more common in this case

150
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:22,719
the device is partly implanted the

151
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:26,200
controller of the system is not imported

152
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:31,570
and only catheters are this is an

153
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:37,060
interesting device because thinking of

154
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:40,500
the implants reports journalists after

155
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:45,959
the research came up with their report

156
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:49,810
analyzing medical devices not just IMD's

157
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:54,550
but other medical devices including

158
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:57,279
prosthesis but in fact L they found that

159
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,000
insulin pumps are one of the systems

160
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,000
that seem to fail more often partly

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,860
because of their operate the way they

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,490
operate

163
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:12,430
so again insulin pumps a very popular

164
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,800
these days and unfortunately they seem

165
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,920
to fail

166
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,490
far too often I mentioned earlier that

167
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,399
it was in 2006 when wireless

168
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:27,029
connectivity started for these devices

169
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:30,540
and you might be wondering why is it

170
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:36,510
that important to have full connection

171
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:40,500
and continuous data streams for these

172
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:45,620
systems one of the motivations has to do

173
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:49,579
with costs thinking about health care

174
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:52,829
management and costs these systems

175
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:56,819
reduce costs because patients need to go

176
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:59,969
less often to the hospital or to their

177
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:03,300
specialist instead of going once a month

178
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:06,300
for instance they would go less often

179
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,269
and that I would call cost less and it

180
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:12,810
would improve their quality of life also

181
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:15,450
a patient monitoring can be continuous

182
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:22,550
the pacemaker for instance can be a

183
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:27,570
transferring data non-stop so that the

184
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:29,880
doctors can check and thanks to machine

185
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:33,149
learning capabilities there would be an

186
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:37,079
alert if something goes wrong logically

187
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:41,190
that means that patients can be managed

188
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:45,620
much better and early detection can be

189
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:51,000
can happen far more easily for different

190
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:54,480
problems and yet very often we find

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,480
still now that they continue to work in

192
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,149
an isolated manner whereas in the near

193
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,220
future all these different devices will

194
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,060
be able to communicate amongst

195
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,470
themselves

196
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:10,319
transfer information from one to another

197
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:13,160
much more easily wireless connectivity

198
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,860
logically first leads needs a

199
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,370
proprietary access point and one of the

200
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,519
problems

201
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,680
and thinking what Michael was saying as

202
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,290
well about industrial environments well

203
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:31,300
in medical in the case of medical

204
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:34,139
devices the world is very small there

205
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:38,589
are very few three four large

206
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:41,350
manufacturers that have all of the

207
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:44,910
market really with very large market

208
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:48,129
shares a very restricted market then and

209
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:51,879
with rather restricted access to

210
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:55,689
information with very few players which

211
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:58,990
means that it's much harder for us to

212
00:12:55,689 --> 00:13:01,269
find out exactly what is going on so

213
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,149
what's required in the case of the

214
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:06,730
pacemaker maker would be the device then

215
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:10,480
an access point and then something like

216
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,139
a Rooter which can't travel or move is

217
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,620
static although more and more

218
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:19,870
manufacturers are beginning to offer

219
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,579
mobile access points and you would need

220
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,600
to carry with you something like a

221
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:28,479
mobile phone that way what happens is

222
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,410
that the pacemaker cells information to

223
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:37,389
the access point and that the data then

224
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:40,749
go to the cloud a to a proprietary point

225
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:44,410
as I said and that information then goes

226
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:48,129
to the doctor or to the hospital when

227
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:51,579
the pacemaker is implanted it first

228
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:55,089
needs to be configured and back in the

229
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:57,399
day in the 1960s that meant that in the

230
00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:01,029
operating room you would have to have

231
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:04,439
all the IT equipment with all the

232
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:06,459
problems you can imagine for hygiene and

233
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:08,319
sterilization which is not the case

234
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:11,378
anymore you can have all that equipment

235
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:14,639
in a room next door for instance thanks

236
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:19,350
to wireless air connectivity which makes

237
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:23,010
surgical hygiene far easier

238
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:25,770
can these devices being be attacked from

239
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:32,189
the point of view of security absolutely

240
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:35,069
they can nurse that's the case and even

241
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:37,530
though there are less devices to be

242
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,170
attacked than in other fields or

243
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:43,920
industries but still they can be

244
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:49,250
attacked on what type of attack attacks

245
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:52,530
I was talking about well a long list

246
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:57,630
although the attacks that we know about

247
00:14:52,530 --> 00:15:01,199
so far have mostly been all laboratories

248
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:04,740
labs being attacked I'm going to tell

249
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,640
you about some of those cases because

250
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:12,570
many of the IMD's a transfer information

251
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:16,380
that's encrypted encrypted data and then

252
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:18,810
how is that information encoded well you

253
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,840
will go to the lab you would go to get

254
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:25,020
UV or Scylla scope you would look into

255
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,270
it and find the coding it does use it

256
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,710
because sometimes they're conventional

257
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:34,380
and encoding system sometimes propriety

258
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:36,960
proprietary systems some are harder to

259
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,570
crack than others but it can be done and

260
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,360
then logically you would be accessing

261
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:46,500
very confidential information on the

262
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:51,000
patient devices can also be reprogrammed

263
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:55,950
and look at this case where an insulin

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,700
pump was reprogrammed and using fairly

265
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:04,110
simple hardware an arduino motherboard

266
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:08,220
and an antenna that was currently kind

267
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:10,170
of finely chewed tuned to do something

268
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,250
else we will be talking about 500

269
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:17,760
megahertz in that case not the same as

270
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:21,510
for wireless systems but again it can be

271
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,210
done for insulin pumps together with

272
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:28,439
reverse engineering just to check which

273
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:30,100
codes can be understood and followed by

274
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,910
the insulin pump which

275
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:39,310
one sconce but the main problem in this

276
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:41,529
case was understanding in Reverse engine

277
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:47,380
engineering what kind of language

278
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:49,990
this device can understand once you find

279
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:53,800
what language it can understand things

280
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,990
you can do most things so that's the

281
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,829
situation with an insulin pump what

282
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:03,130
about a pacemaker which is more critical

283
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:06,730
if you can send it commands that the

284
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:12,159
pacemaker can accept you could simulate

285
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:15,730
and provoke a heart attack for that

286
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:16,419
patient or a neuro stimulator for

287
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,510
instance

288
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:24,510
if a patient has a very similar severe

289
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:28,179
tremor just simply by deactivating the

290
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:30,580
neurotransmitter the patient would

291
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:35,049
suffer from very very severe tremor

292
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:38,908
again or anyhow quite dangerous

293
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:46,299
situations or having a very high voltage

294
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:51,880
applied just by switching the device on

295
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:55,389
and off that also hurts the battery in

296
00:17:51,880 --> 00:18:00,130
the device and why can that be critical

297
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:03,100
because it's a device we have in our

298
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:07,000
body and in a pacemaker for instance a

299
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:13,658
battery tends to last for three to five

300
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,820
years as the life but if you make it

301
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:18,100
switch on and off continuously the

302
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,320
battery life would be shorter and then

303
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,168
if you need to have it changed that

304
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,600
would require a surgical procedure which

305
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:33,740
is not a critical procedure but still

306
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:36,770
the it has associated risks

307
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:41,809
well I will talk more about batteries

308
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:44,899
later on and why Wireless should or

309
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:48,639
shouldn't be used but anyhow batteries

310
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:52,729
are fairly critical for these systems

311
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,990
when security and safety solutions are

312
00:18:52,730 --> 00:19:00,200
designed for IMD's you might be thinking

313
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:05,120
well why are they so different why not

314
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:08,059
just use normal security mechanisms that

315
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:12,620
we are familiar with and as I often say

316
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:16,370
well you can and you can't because the

317
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,408
main difference here is that firstly we

318
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:22,428
need to think of the patient safety and

319
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:27,820
only as a second factor we need to think

320
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:33,409
about ID security so for instance

321
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:37,120
computing capabilities and memory and

322
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:39,799
battery they're all fairly limited in

323
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:46,360
IMD's so we need to bear that in mind

324
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:50,658
when we talk about safety and security

325
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:54,500
solutions for these devices and we need

326
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:57,649
to strike a balance amongst all those

327
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:01,789
elements so let's go back to batteries

328
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:05,120
I said how these batteries tend to last

329
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:07,850
for five to ten years if they need to be

330
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,729
replaced most of the time that would

331
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:14,480
involve a surgical procedure although

332
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:16,940
some of these devices can be recharged

333
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,270
overnight for instance through a

334
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,370
wireless system why is that a problem we

335
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:26,000
do it we can do it for instance with

336
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:29,600
mobile phones well in the case of IMD's

337
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,580
because the device has been implanted we

338
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,520
don't know really

339
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,059
if that wireless

340
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:44,220
Reeth charging of the battery might have

341
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:50,590
a negative impact in on what organs or

342
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:54,120
biological systems we don't know we need

343
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:58,389
to look into it so we've got that house

344
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:01,270
some imd manufacturers as i said i have

345
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:05,020
been launching and products with this

346
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:09,809
system but it's still quite risky what

347
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:17,320
about memory IMD's have a fairly limited

348
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:20,950
memory for storage and storage means for

349
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:26,100
instance keeping what's been happening

350
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:30,880
for cardiovascular events during the day

351
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:38,559
why is memory limited because if it was

352
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:41,410
greater it would need more power so

353
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:45,910
computing and communication capabilities

354
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:50,260
are also limited in IMD's and let's not

355
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:53,890
forget how communication it's quite

356
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:57,990
critical here and why is it so limited

357
00:21:53,890 --> 00:22:02,530
because again it's power intensive and

358
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:08,429
if it was any greater then the batteries

359
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:13,059
would last a shorter so again whatever

360
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:17,380
security mechanisms we decide need to be

361
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:20,770
added we need to weigh a

362
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:23,919
the impact that will have on battery

363
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:28,330
life if wireless recharging of the

364
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:31,690
batteries was improved and safe that

365
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:34,539
would be very interesting this is an

366
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:38,260
adversary model with active and passive

367
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:42,610
attacks which can be possible in AI and

368
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:46,020
IMD's what can we do for protection

369
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:49,809
mechanisms basically we would have our

370
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:54,879
traditional mechanisms although in this

371
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:58,510
particular industry they need to be well

372
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,340
adapted to these devices some of the

373
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,450
solutions that I'm going to be telling

374
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:09,428
you about have to do with biometrics

375
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:15,190
I've brought you two examples then here

376
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:19,590
we can see biometrics based on ECG which

377
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:23,080
is the system that we know best about

378
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:26,320
well we design an authentication system

379
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:31,389
we can use something that we know about

380
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:36,090
a password or a key something we own or

381
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:42,480
have like a smart card or maybe a

382
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:46,449
fingerprint or some biometrical signal

383
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:50,289
by in biometrics systems should always

384
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:52,659
be universal unique only and identifying

385
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:53,679
me and nobody else it should be

386
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:58,059
permanent

387
00:23:53,679 --> 00:24:01,090
over time it wouldn't change over time

388
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:03,970
all the signals biometric signals are

389
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:07,030
not totally absolutely permanent since

390
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:13,870
we were born until we die systems will

391
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:17,110
have to be updated every so many years

392
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:20,789
but still fairly permanent invariant

393
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:24,770
over time system should be collectible

394
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:28,460
reliable and with signals that can be

395
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:33,860
attained easily and then as I said well

396
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:38,960
obviously reliable and acceptable let me

397
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:42,678
focus now on ECG signals here we can see

398
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:46,610
a heart what are we measuring then well

399
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:48,850
we're measuring electric activity in the

400
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,850
heart

401
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:58,550
specifically action potentials that

402
00:24:52,900 --> 00:25:02,600
heart cells have here we have different

403
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:07,550
waves then that can then be added and

404
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:11,149
finally give us the ECG signal made up

405
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:15,350
by different waves the P wave then the

406
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:19,220
QRS complex then that peak you can see

407
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:23,149
there are equates to the heartbeat every

408
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:26,540
beep as we said as we say and then the

409
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,100
two final waves one of them is the T

410
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:31,510
wave which is the one that we're going

411
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,580
to be monitoring and playing around with

412
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:39,500
I'm going to tell you now about a piece

413
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:42,320
of research that wanted to find use a

414
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,190
compressed ECG signals for

415
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,649
authentication purposes before I tell

416
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,660
you about this today I want to tell you

417
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,200
give you a little bit of information

418
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:58,250
about biometrics when we work with

419
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:02,570
signals we can work either with time or

420
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:04,910
with a transformed domain here we can

421
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,610
see the different points and the peaks

422
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:11,470
of the signal peaks and valleys

423
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:15,830
difference in time between the peaks is

424
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:18,620
that easy to calculate well it is but

425
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,659
it's very time-consuming and that's why

426
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,360
some other people think instead of using

427
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,210
time why about freq whatever frequency

428
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,428
which seems some time to be simpler if

429
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,850
we talk about frequency we have some

430
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:35,059
many transforms that help me transform

431
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,090
that temporal signal into the frequency

432
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:38,309
we have for ears

433
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:40,799
transform one of the best-known what

434
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:43,668
Wyler's transform quite fashionable now

435
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,710
and we specifically we use walls Halla

436
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:50,580
once had a man transform and I'll

437
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,480
explain why why did we could for what

438
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,149
these ones

439
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,850
Hadamard transform we wanted it to be

440
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,740
very efficient in computational terms it

441
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,719
has to be a solution that will be

442
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,850
embedded in a very limited advisor we

443
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,830
really wanted to be easy to be computed

444
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:09,330
and actually this is what we get out of

445
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:12,360
WH T WH T is multiplying a matrix the

446
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,740
time signal so you have ones and minus

447
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,299
one so it's quite simple to calculate

448
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:22,049
this transform and then this feature is

449
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:23,820
not exclusive to the WH T but it

450
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:27,510
compresses signal what does it mean that

451
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:29,399
it compresses signal well it get all the

452
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,779
information it gets all information that

453
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:32,908
it would be the first coefficients or

454
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,970
ratios of the signal and with that we

455
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:39,539
have all the information and so it helps

456
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:41,190
us a rule out or despise so to say the

457
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,740
remainder of the signal this is

458
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:50,549
important because with a compressive

459
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:53,159
version of the signal we get it all so

460
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:55,440
this is a classical biometrical system

461
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,270
if you are not familiar with biometric

462
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,450
system on the one hand we have the

463
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:02,429
sensor the sensor can be the IMG that

464
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,580
it's inside of us or it could be a

465
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:08,610
sensor with some probes or electrodes or

466
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:11,490
leads or electrodes on the body so this

467
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:14,789
looks like an AKG but usually lots of

468
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:17,010
noise and absent tones etc so these for

469
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:19,770
this we need to have a pre-processing

470
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:22,770
sin of the Sigma so we need to clean the

471
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:26,129
signal so it looks like a textbook AKG

472
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:28,559
after which we need to mine out some

473
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,360
features in order to distract or minor

474
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,178
the pictures of well we have two options

475
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,000
I've already set that first we go to

476
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,980
time to manor then frequency domain

477
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,919
there's also an option of mind in

478
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,470
features and time and frequency I and

479
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,880
then combine them actually we chose

480
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,559
something simple that it's only

481
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,470
frequency

482
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,080
then we have what is machine learning a

483
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:54,480
classifier and we have so many different

484
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,360
classifiers here then I'll explain that

485
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,820
we use a simple approach theory but

486
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,719
works very nicely and it's not too

487
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,639
complicated this would be the system

488
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,830
basically with these kind of systems we

489
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:10,408
have the pre-processing typically at

490
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,799
least you need to do a couple of things

491
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:16,200
first remove the continuous stream and

492
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,259
then have a passband filter to remove

493
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,330
most of the noise that we have there

494
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,970
these are the typical parameters that we

495
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,070
handle in order to read an AKG

496
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,929
and then something else has to be done

497
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,200
well you have an AKG which is a

498
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:34,470
continuous stream that has to be

499
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,869
segmented so split into parts here what

500
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:40,379
we did was get to second windows and you

501
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:45,899
might ask why two second windows instead

502
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:50,789
of less if you take into account the

503
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:53,340
heart beat of a person the heart of a

504
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:55,429
raid of a person a man or a woman for

505
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,949
the average rate we wanted that window

506
00:29:55,429 --> 00:30:00,509
to have two bits

507
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,940
yt bits because according to the

508
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:05,279
literature it is quite simple to you

509
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,980
correct your ass biometrics system using

510
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,980
a cane EKG using just two bits and

511
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,139
that's why and taking into account you

512
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:19,590
our sampling frequency we've got two

513
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:23,039
seconds or 256 samples and so this is a

514
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:25,320
transform this is a sequence II and this

515
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,320
is a coefficient we got every test and

516
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,090
we saw that just with 24 ratios require

517
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,529
features we can characterize the signal

518
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,428
you need to understand that we move from

519
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:38,460
250 examples that we have for time 324

520
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:41,810
ratios or samples for frequencies so

521
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:44,360
it's quite a significant reduction right

522
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,010
and then we also check whether if we

523
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,189
were adding something else that's

524
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:51,110
entropy entropy fondest to the signal

525
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,930
and see if with that we could improve

526
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:57,649
the identification system or not this is

527
00:30:53,930 --> 00:31:01,220
what we put forward for a system as

528
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,930
classifier I said so if you've learned

529
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,480
some machine learning or you're familiar

530
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,880
with it there are some so many options

531
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:12,610
here we used a very simple one which is

532
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:15,740
an GAE LD a nonparametric and vague

533
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:18,080
system and why did we use it well

534
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,230
firstly because it's simple and easily

535
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,360
implemented and secondly because there

536
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:27,590
is no guessing about the data

537
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,990
distribution which is good and why does

538
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:32,149
it not well well it doesn't take any

539
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,130
tree training for this there is no

540
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,560
training only thing we need to do is to

541
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:41,630
store the sample and then compare it you

542
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:45,740
need a sample to what you had there's

543
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,930
this with the K Ln there's a parameter

544
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,270
see how many neighboring values you will

545
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:52,190
check for the classification here we'll

546
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,900
looked into several configurations and

547
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,920
even with yes one neighbor neighbor

548
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:00,440
Valley in good word usually three five

549
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,090
nine neighbors it was enough but we

550
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,040
didn't have any significant improvement

551
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:09,050
as to increase the complexity of the

552
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:11,210
system so what data's are did we use in

553
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:14,860
order to check this system we used a

554
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:18,260
data set which is well known when

555
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:21,500
there's a database a large one known as

556
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:23,840
fishing net and there if you are into

557
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,030
this topic and you want to go deeper

558
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,850
into it you have so many data sets and

559
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:32,270
you can have so many signals there here

560
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:34,159
well I said there's this one why did we

561
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:38,810
choose this data set basically because

562
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,330
it has a iki JS for G's for 24 hours

563
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:43,370
they are not so many data sets where you

564
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,340
monitor the subject for so long so this

565
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,659
is one of the largest data sets and then

566
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,020
on the other hand

567
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:53,840
it is also that subject have no severe

568
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:57,139
heart disease or condition no

569
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:02,300
significant arrhythmias so here we have

570
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:04,250
to say that this data said it is true

571
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,560
that it's great for experimenting for

572
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,090
the early testing but and you need to

573
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,030
take into account that this subject that

574
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:14,209
is people are in ideal conditions they

575
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:17,690
are standing still or lying down and

576
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:20,270
usually this data set has been with

577
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:25,280
seven to nine electrodes on the subject

578
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:27,889
so this is ideal you also need to test

579
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,660
these with a hostile environment where

580
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:33,350
the subject develops differing

581
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:35,270
activities and moves around and where

582
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:36,530
there's no seven electrodes but usually

583
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,150
the typical three electrode

584
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,680
configuration so there will be more

585
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:43,130
noise in the signal that's the kind of

586
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,810
thing so you really need to play around

587
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,430
not just with this kind of data set that

588
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,860
is for a clinical environment but also

589
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:51,890
for a more realistic daily life

590
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,389
environment as well let me show you

591
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:57,710
without going into detail of what the

592
00:33:53,390 --> 00:34:00,650
results are and so depending on with

593
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:05,900
them well so we have two options one and

594
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:07,790
two option one we only use had about

595
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,470
gracious and then have them outrageous

596
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,989
and entropy in the second step and

597
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:14,239
there's a significant improvement as you

598
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:18,020
see on the screen but not that big so we

599
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:22,839
are somewhere around 95 97% of accuracy

600
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,840
so that means that it works quite well

601
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,529
[Music]

602
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:30,049
this is a first approach a classical

603
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:32,089
approach and how to solve the biometric

604
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:36,079
authentication problem and next what I

605
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:38,319
wanted to say is one of our recent works

606
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,029
I don't know if you know about

607
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:43,518
authentication systems continuous

608
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:45,829
authentication systems but the previous

609
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:47,719
system is a classic system for non

610
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:48,889
continuous authentication where the user

611
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,018
for example non continuous

612
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,690
authentication would be you get educated

613
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:55,908
ones for example where we lock onto the

614
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,019
system you set your user and password

615
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:59,900
and you don't need to authenticate

616
00:34:57,018 --> 00:35:01,848
yourself any longer for continuous

617
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,829
authentication that's more demanding

618
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:09,170
because the user has to log in every

619
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:12,859
given time that given time will be set

620
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:14,809
up in the system it can be chosen every

621
00:35:12,859 --> 00:35:17,869
three milliseconds every three minutes

622
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:20,180
or whatever the meta parameter we choose

623
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:22,640
but there we check continuously and we

624
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,859
make sure it is a legitimate user and

625
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,240
it's quite significant difference for

626
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:31,730
this kind of a solution problem is that

627
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,828
classical techniques from data main in

628
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:35,359
mine an old machine learning what they

629
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:38,000
do not work it is true that the

630
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,119
classical ones help us deal with large

631
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,279
data sets but we cannot treat with this

632
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,910
concept that is known as data stream

633
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:49,670
mining so the data stream mine and it's

634
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,129
a new area of artificial intelligence

635
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,619
and we can treat signals in a continuous

636
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:57,799
way so what are the features of this

637
00:35:54,619 --> 00:36:01,279
kind of systems first difference is that

638
00:35:57,799 --> 00:36:05,119
signals or the samples we have were only

639
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:06,920
done once then another important feature

640
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,980
is that the number of resources is very

641
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,720
limited both were memory both for

642
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,200
working conditions if we compare a

643
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,328
classical session with datum a mining if

644
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,399
you have trained and testing the

645
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:21,589
training and the testing data said you

646
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,500
can all go into the memory it all fit

647
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:26,930
same and then for a data stream mining

648
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,450
the data set and the testing does not

649
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,640
testing or no training the testing

650
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:33,618
training would be just one and it's all

651
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,940
fierce together so I cannot tell apart

652
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:36,680
what's destined under the strain in

653
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:39,530
problem is that I get samples and I

654
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,109
continuous basis which means every

655
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,730
second every millisecond I get that and

656
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:46,060
that's an indefinite it seems the

657
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:49,670
process starts and never stops

658
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:51,650
that process is to be infinite and then

659
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,990
another feature that I have to take into

660
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:55,550
account is has to be immediate I might

661
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,919
have a system but that system needs to

662
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,540
predict I need to get a sample and I

663
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,300
need to be able to predict that very

664
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,829
same minute Mahmood this would be the

665
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:06,050
greatest difference between the previous

666
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:11,150
system which is a bit more static and

667
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:13,520
this one is a bit a time series that

668
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,630
evolves with time and keeps feeding on a

669
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,349
continuous basis

670
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:20,750
for this to happen there is new field in

671
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:23,510
artificial intelligence a data stream

672
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:25,910
managing systems it's a different way of

673
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:29,630
processing the system that we put

674
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:32,210
forward well some are similar to what we

675
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,920
had but so we have the sensor first we

676
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:36,710
have the pre-processing and the feature

677
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,770
extraction originally this would be the

678
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:41,240
same as with what we had with the

679
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:43,280
previous proposal then we will see

680
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,759
whether it is just the same as what we

681
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,880
proposed and then we had if we forget

682
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,490
about this it's a similarity module we

683
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,130
would have what's known as been learned

684
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:57,609
at the learning system here it will be a

685
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:00,770
learning system that can be based on

686
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:03,078
learning systems for data stream morning

687
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:07,250
or data mining rather that we know but

688
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:09,079
they need to be updated they need to be

689
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,599
transformed that is in order to use it

690
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:15,260
for our new paradigm and as I was saying

691
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:18,470
we add a new module that we called the

692
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:21,410
similarity module and what we say here

693
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:23,359
is that before feeding the system we

694
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:26,240
wanted to say do not add samples into

695
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:29,420
the system that are too bad quality so

696
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,459
we discard those that are too bad that's

697
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:35,390
what we did with the similarity module

698
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,980
so without going deep into it processing

699
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:40,759
is just the same

700
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:44,660
and then feature distraction we used

701
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,490
hatha Mars but since the system is a bit

702
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:50,240
more than mundane because I'm checking

703
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:52,669
the system every few minutes I need to

704
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,839
you better characterize the signal and

705
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:58,700
for that I need 256 coefficients the

706
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:03,440
compressed version is not enough I need

707
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:05,629
all 50 256 as for similarity basically

708
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,070
here we have a very simple model this

709
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:09,430
the first approach is a correlation

710
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:15,170
model and that would be 8

711
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:18,618
the idea is to rule out samples as for

712
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:26,119
the learner we basically use but we use

713
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:27,859
an K and n okay and n which is

714
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,380
simplified and with a limited memory

715
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:32,839
this is a slide in window as it is

716
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:36,050
called basically we only keep in the

717
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:38,690
memory what's the most recent sample it

718
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:40,880
makes sense because in the end what this

719
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:44,230
may say as well or what these systems do

720
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:49,310
is they adjust to the changes in our

721
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:51,710
time series this would be an a EKG and

722
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,450
it seems that our EKG is better

723
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,970
characterized with the most recent

724
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:58,009
samples and this is what we keep in our

725
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:05,060
memory but this is a very limited memory

726
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:06,980
of okay so for the memory you need to

727
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:10,460
consider that we used different

728
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:12,830
approaches we use the buffer and

729
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:16,970
unbuffered

730
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:20,210
so we analyzed the system a high-demand

731
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:24,169
an analysis that is that where we check

732
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:26,870
the system every two seconds she says

733
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:29,120
that is and then we have the buffered

734
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:34,640
approach where we check the system every

735
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:36,680
three minutes so it is real time well

736
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,290
not real time but every few minutes and

737
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:45,129
we have a larger regular time interval

738
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:47,930
so this is what's shown here basically

739
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:51,770
what you see here is how the system

740
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:55,730
behaves if the authentication is every

741
00:40:51,770 --> 00:41:02,780
two seconds or 90 seconds that is 32

742
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:05,000
minutes if it's 2 seconds the accuracy

743
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:08,240
well there is some slight deterioration

744
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,300
down to 80 percent not bad but

745
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,990
relatively low and so if we're less

746
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:17,000
demanding in the system we managed to

747
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:19,970
get the accuracy that we were having in

748
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,390
a classical system around 95% which is a

749
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:27,259
figure which is much more relevant as I

750
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:28,940
was saying the greatest difference here

751
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:32,470
is that what we are monetary in real

752
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:35,360
time and the other great difference is

753
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:39,049
that the memory that the system needs is

754
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,510
way lower so it can embed these systems

755
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,490
in limited systems because you don't

756
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:50,540
need that much memory to keep working

757
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:52,790
and say must be before Y KL and here it

758
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:57,470
is because it is simple and it takes

759
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:58,430
little computing power of the system and

760
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:01,270
neck

761
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:03,500
what I wanted to say is well okay so far

762
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,569
what we had is we can have

763
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,990
authentication systems where the

764
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:12,770
continues are not which are a EKG phased

765
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:15,290
but then we thought of the future and we

766
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:18,079
said okay can we improve the system can

767
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:20,779
we put forward a system that is better

768
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,119
if we're using instead of one signal

769
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:26,390
several signals that was known as a

770
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:30,800
multi modal system and this is what we

771
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:36,859
did here so here we have a prototype it

772
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:40,309
is homemade and you do that well it is

773
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:43,339
low cost to clean some roofs not to easy

774
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:45,859
to move around but it is lab study so

775
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:47,720
it's a test and basically what kind of

776
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:59,140
signal would be cared we would get the

777
00:42:47,720 --> 00:43:05,569
EKG PPG the accelerometer and the GS are

778
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:08,328
two hot signals motion signal and the

779
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:16,000
galvanic answer which is usually used by

780
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:16,000
those who work with motions or emotions

781
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:23,240
biometric system even if the figure is

782
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,740
it looks better this is the classic

783
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,339
biometric system there's nothing new

784
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:30,319
here what kind of signals are we using

785
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:34,308
will arise as I said before and the

786
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:38,869
features same as for EF GS kilometer or

787
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:44,329
PPG the same back to frequency and we

788
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:47,270
were not sure to see whatever we used in

789
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:49,190
hot Mars or few years transformed just

790
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:52,160
to see if one was filled in better

791
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:54,079
results than the other but GSR I don't

792
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,359
know if you've ever looked onto a GSR

793
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,930
signal but it's quite simple not much in

794
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:03,020
fluctuations and we see that with some

795
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:04,940
statistic metrics we can characterize it

796
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,119
quite easily doesn't take much more than

797
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,119
that

798
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,370
as for the glass of fire there is a

799
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:17,380
basic difference here compare team

800
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:19,330
previous proposals and that is that what

801
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:22,630
I've said so far we've followed a

802
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:26,680
classic approach of data mining you have

803
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:29,290
a 10 subject data set and that data set

804
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:31,060
you'd split it into training and testing

805
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,580
and you have 10 subjects on training and

806
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:36,250
10 and testing that's was usually done

807
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,840
with data mining but if you are thinking

808
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:41,170
of a system that you want to train with

809
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:43,300
your own signal first you get your

810
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,970
signal and then you got your signal and

811
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:47,800
everyone else's but initially I don't

812
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:51,509
have that signal from anyone else if you

813
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:54,070
want to train your phone with your heart

814
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:58,480
signal it you need to use your same out

815
00:44:54,070 --> 00:45:02,530
not anyone elses and so we used the one

816
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,210
class of classifiers where the trait for

817
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,910
the train will have one signal one

818
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:10,780
subject and for the testing we have a

819
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:15,009
set of subjects the target and some some

820
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:17,190
more that's what we saw here and the

821
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:19,480
advantage here okay the what we've done

822
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,950
one of the advantages our main

823
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:26,080
difference is compared to the previous

824
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:29,379
ones is that so far and it is a weakness

825
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:31,840
or a deficit in many papers but in most

826
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:34,720
of the previous papers that I have

827
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:37,690
introduced here and also others are

828
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,299
based on data sets that are limited see

829
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:42,250
the medical environment because that's

830
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,660
what's available soon now if you want to

831
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:46,240
do something and you don't have a data

832
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:49,660
set the databases we have are from a

833
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:52,899
medical setting so we produce our own

834
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:55,000
data set quite rudimentary but it would

835
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,950
allow us to look into several things

836
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,210
first

837
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:59,980
you have several activities this is

838
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,860
activity number one when the subject is

839
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:05,920
standard still subjected activity to you

840
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:10,510
when walking three when the years stand

841
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:13,260
the sealed but just after walking and

842
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:15,970
back to sit in

843
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:18,340
we wanted to see how the system behaves

844
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:20,770
for several activities and how it

845
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,690
behaves if strained for activity and

846
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:25,330
then test it in a different activity

847
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:28,930
which was not a large blood by other

848
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:31,330
datasets here you see that's not the

849
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:34,000
accuracy you've seen this the other way

850
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:40,029
around this is the ER stands for error

851
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,380
in the system probably well you don't

852
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:43,810
see the scale but what we're interested

853
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:46,900
in is having a figure that is as clear

854
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:49,150
as possible we have a pale yellow and so

855
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:52,900
much as possible each you have one

856
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:55,600
single signal at the a EKG is what works

857
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,480
best and we already knew and so this

858
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:03,160
contributes to our theory and other

859
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:05,410
signals PPG GSR or the accelerometer in

860
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,080
themselves do not work so it's better to

861
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:10,450
combine them and here you have a

862
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:13,000
combination of all the signals and

863
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:17,770
typically if we combine I don't know for

864
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,440
scenario 3 and we combine PS PPG and GSR

865
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:24,640
and others we have good accuracy and

866
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,920
good error levels which means what well

867
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,230
the conclusions we can draw are that it

868
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,270
seems that if we combine several

869
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,830
sickness well it's not that it seems we

870
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:35,380
see that from the results if we combine

871
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:39,310
different signals we improve results it

872
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:40,870
is true that with a key EKG we get

873
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:46,900
better with also it's a slight

874
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:50,440
improvement so what I think is that we

875
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:53,160
need to be heading towards combining

876
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,170
different signals and why that because

877
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,690
actually in most cases our body whether

878
00:47:56,170 --> 00:48:03,010
inside or around as we have a series of

879
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:05,530
senses and in this about tapping on the

880
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:11,800
potential of all those signals that we

881
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:13,930
get from sensors so just let me discuss

882
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,930
a few conclusions for medical devices

883
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,879
that are implantable so I am DS IRA

884
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:21,879
reality yeah that's true the new

885
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,220
generation of IMD's are already out in

886
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,700
the market

887
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:29,640
most producers or almost every producer

888
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:31,618
off for these imd with wireless

889
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,680
connectivity it is a reality it is true

890
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:37,680
though that is a reality for some I am

891
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:40,140
days for pacemakers everywhere for

892
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,149
simulators there are some manufacturers

893
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:45,509
that add it but not all of them for

894
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:48,300
insulin pump yes they add these features

895
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:50,400
so it is a reality from the point of

896
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,310
view of cybersecurity it is a very

897
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,950
serious problem then we would need to

898
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:59,220
approach from the design stage I would

899
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:00,390
say my main criticism here is how

900
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,640
restricted

901
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,379
this is how difficult it is to have

902
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,710
access to information how difficult it

903
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:10,530
is to can access you manufacturers we do

904
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:12,180
have experience dealing with several

905
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:16,140
manufacturers trying to gather

906
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:20,368
information trying to have devices and

907
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:23,879
reality is that most cases it's a

908
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:26,010
negative response and and only little

909
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,930
information why is that I guess that

910
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:30,770
they are risking lots of money and not

911
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:36,419
are not willing to crack the melon open

912
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:38,819
for our security analysis and the thing

913
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:42,740
is whether they crack them themselves or

914
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:45,839
someone else the reality will be found

915
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,790
so it's all about spilling the beans so

916
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:51,690
one of the main things that it's saving

917
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:55,440
us it is that nowadays if we want to be

918
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:59,250
treated with a pacemaker it is not easy

919
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:02,040
to get one and if you have to buy it it

920
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:05,010
is somewhere from 6,000 to 12,000 years

921
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:08,930
so we will not just go on eBay and buy

922
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:13,200
one so it's difficult to buy and so the

923
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:14,040
research is moving slower than we would

924
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,618
like it to

925
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:21,690
as for paid pacemakers you need to be in

926
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:24,089
contact with hospitals and doctors and

927
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:27,780
then through them you will gain access

928
00:50:24,089 --> 00:50:30,029
to devices or information of that kind

929
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:32,210
and from the point of view biometrics it

930
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:35,510
is true that biometrics

931
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:37,670
few years back what we've known for many

932
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:40,940
years now but it is true that in recent

933
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:43,070
years there's been some progress in this

934
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,530
field but I guess all new techniques for

935
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:48,440
a data stream mining dip learning it can

936
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:52,250
all help design new security solutions

937
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,869
for this kind of devices but we need to

938
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:56,960
know whether it will be embedded or not

939
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:59,480
if there are things you can do with it

940
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,810
and then my proposal would be that we

941
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:06,650
move on to a world where it is not just

942
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:09,890
a single Signum sector but a combination

943
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:13,430
of signals rather and that will make

944
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:17,990
things easier lower error greater

945
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:19,368
accuracy more stable systems etc so

946
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:22,810
thank you very much for your attention

947
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:22,810
in any of their questions

948
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:45,140
what about state of security in devices

949
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:50,410
implantable or not there was one looking

950
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,410
into brain waves and

951
00:51:51,160 --> 00:52:02,500
so aren't you working on privacy of data

952
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,500
which are not medical setting per se but

953
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:09,110
then we would need security right

954
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:14,419
security measures because it's about

955
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:19,610
health but about privacy as well I do

956
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:22,640
agree I do agree on the one hand safety

957
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:24,440
patient safety comes well that comes

958
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,359
first but then security the safety as

959
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,700
security come in hand in hand and we

960
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,410
need to protect as well the privacy of

961
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:32,569
information access information and

962
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:35,420
everything else what do we find now well

963
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:40,640
reality is that most of the devices out

964
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:43,100
in the market do not give that the

965
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,560
problem is access and information so if

966
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,759
you take the data sheet with the

967
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,980
manufacturer's description they'll say

968
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:52,790
the it's a safe and secure device with

969
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:55,910
mechanisms in place but truly what we've

970
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:58,490
proven this this paper just a few months

971
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:01,009
back with some investigations of

972
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:03,290
researchers looking into every pacemaker

973
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:06,530
for air from every manufacturer and same

974
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:10,730
conclusion is that barely any security

975
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:11,810
measures are taken as for brain devices

976
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,520
whether implantable and or not

977
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:16,670
implantable I don't know which one

978
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,130
you're referring to some come to mind

979
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:20,900
but most of them I would say there is no

980
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:25,000
security mechanism when there should be

981
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,000
some in place thank you very much

982
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:35,319
but is their model kind of the agreement

983
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:39,190
Geneva agreement for regulations on

984
00:53:35,319 --> 00:53:46,500
attacks and devices very closely linked

985
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:49,420
to patients lives I'm unaware of where

986
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:52,450
if there's anything as you say with the

987
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:54,970
agreement of Geneva but there is a law

988
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:57,279
in Europe for privacy that needs to be

989
00:53:54,970 --> 00:54:00,939
complied with and it's basic and if

990
00:53:57,279 --> 00:54:03,880
information is on plain text it's not

991
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:06,130
been complied with so these are things

992
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,170
basic things that need to be done and

993
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:11,319
are not being done why I don't really

994
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:13,660
know I would say the main problem

995
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:17,400
nowadays well fund manufacturers have

996
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:19,629
just focusing on patient's safety and

997
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:24,339
improving the quality of life of their

998
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:28,420
patients that's it but adding wireless

999
00:54:24,339 --> 00:54:32,259
connectivity it's that huge paradigm

1000
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:33,880
shift and this opens new doors and

1001
00:54:32,259 --> 00:54:37,779
that's what they need to focus on now

1002
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,970
and I'd say they are not paying

1003
00:54:37,779 --> 00:54:41,349
attention and a main problem as I said

1004
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:43,328
is the interface how they will

1005
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:45,849
communicate with the manufacturers it's

1006
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:51,430
only a bunch of them and it's a very

1007
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:52,950
limited environment so we published

1008
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:57,578
every vision

1009
00:54:52,950 --> 00:55:00,118
this was Commons first attempt on her

1010
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:03,190
dissertation and there was an interview

1011
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:05,079
for a journal and the next day and it's

1012
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:06,670
been man's that we had been trying to

1013
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:08,349
talk to some manufacturers and the next

1014
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,839
day we got calls from every manufacturer

1015
00:55:08,349 --> 00:55:14,460
because we were saying that IMD's were

1016
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:16,839
not safe nor secure so there this

1017
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:19,029
there's money at stake here but only

1018
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:22,000
when you think that their business might

1019
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:24,630
be compromised that's when they worry if

1020
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,630
you ask me

1021
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:32,049
I hope these changes and I hope they

1022
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:34,510
include security measures as they

1023
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:35,859
but what about the battery battery I

1024
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:39,480
think it's critical as well and

1025
00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:42,869
everything you do will reduce a battery

1026
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,869
thank you very much

1027
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:51,910
I'd like to know if there is a specific

1028
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:52,900
use case for which units continuous

1029
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:56,828
authentication

1030
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:59,349
I am designated to guarantee the

1031
00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:02,339
continuous authentication of users well

1032
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:04,660
it depends on how critical the system is

1033
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:07,000
there are systems that require

1034
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:11,500
authentication actually there's this one

1035
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:15,310
company that is selling and see a system

1036
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:17,349
that is based on EKG it seems to be and

1037
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:20,500
continues authentication for your home

1038
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:22,030
this is for a dramatic house where you

1039
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,700
are pressing the state in what you can

1040
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:26,980
do and cannot do but I'd say that the

1041
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:29,319
authentication methods continuous with

1042
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:31,450
integration methods not just hard right

1043
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:34,990
but that's where we are headed so if you

1044
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:37,839
think of your cell phone it does check

1045
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:40,089
so instead of locking and unlocking all

1046
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:42,670
somehow making sure that you are there

1047
00:56:40,089 --> 00:56:44,078
that you are who you say you are but

1048
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:46,390
actually there's nothing you need to do

1049
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:50,260
so it would be a much more transparent

1050
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:54,970
system for the user but making sure that

1051
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:57,960
the user there is legit this other

1052
00:56:54,970 --> 00:57:01,149
question there's another question so

1053
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:03,849
biometric systems such as FID preneur

1054
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:08,290
retina scam could they not be

1055
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:14,520
replaceable here the retina scan is very

1056
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:14,520
reliable but problem here is invasive

1057
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:20,410
that's probably why is less popular than

1058
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:24,160
the fingerprint that has been going for

1059
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:33,848
quite a few years what's the main

1060
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:37,868
difference between EKG or ECG signals

1061
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:43,029
and the fingerprint well with ECG

1062
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:45,970
systems you might wear say a t-shirt

1063
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:48,700
with sensors and that's not science

1064
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:51,910
fiction that's being manufactured and

1065
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:54,848
that would be measuring not just your

1066
00:57:51,910 --> 00:58:03,129
heart rates but all of the biometric

1067
00:57:54,849 --> 00:58:05,589
parameters that's a very rich signal and

1068
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:07,990
not only that does transparent as far as

1069
00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:11,049
the user is concerned there is no need

1070
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:14,439
for continuous interaction where you

1071
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:17,500
don't need to keep your finger or your

1072
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:22,890
hand on a particular Sports every so

1073
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:28,720
often so those biometric signals a very

1074
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:41,670
user friendly less invasive and easier

1075
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:41,669
for the user any for

1076
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:49,140
if that's not the case I would like to

1077
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:53,919
thank you once again for attending my

1078
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:56,319
presentation and if you think at a later

1079
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,839
date of any doubts or questions please

1080
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:02,710
get in touch I'll be very very pleased

1081
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:05,980
to give you more information about this

1082
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:10,300
particular topic it's not just me doing

1083
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:12,640
this research it's a group of us and we

1084
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,490
are currently still under which is still

1085
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,930
under way thank you for your attention

1086
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:17,930
