131
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:39,478
orange book the which was the first

132
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:43,598

134
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,080
other countries George it and

135
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,710
implemented as a computer system

136
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,860
evaluation criteria it was well javi

137
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,050
myself have been dealing and working in

138
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,810
their computers using evaluation

139
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,579
criteria for 11 years now okay when

140
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,380
having watched the film for the first

141
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,390
time ever he would have never have

142
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,140
dreamt that at the end the in few years

143
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,569
time he would be working in that field

144
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:16,540
so the importance of that

145
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:18,430
movie has been seen in few years time

146
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:23,769
and then when we talk about

147
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:26,529
entrepreneurship often we talk about the

148
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:30,010
world of ideas that you need to have

149
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:32,889
like a breakthrough a disruptive idea

150
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,800

151
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:40,329

152
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,459

153
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:47,920

158
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,810
in my life was a dream a dream which was

159
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:09,910

160
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:14,189
my life to something that I loved

161
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:19,880

169
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:53,160
and now a dream that you put a day to

170
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:55,670
becomes goal a goal which has his broken

171
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,010
down in the steps becomes a plan and

172
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:02,819
implemented plan can turn a dream into

173
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:06,260
reality okay this is the only complex to

174
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:09,180
follow a step in from the self-help book

175
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,290
but at the end of the day this is true

176
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,140
this is the way it is we all have dreams

177
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:18,540
but we really need to put a date

178
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:20,189
deadline to fulfill our dreams we need

179
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,120
to give a timeframe to it

180
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:30,480
if we don't do that we will leave most

181
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:33,750
likely be bitten or by laziness or by

182
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,300
the mandates of society or by what the

183
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:40,470
others expect from us and then was

184
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:43,979
extremely important having a plan if you

185
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:46,380
want to achieve a goal the best way or

186
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,590
easiest way to achieve your goal is to

187
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,750
break it down into steps the steps that

188
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,930
you have to follow that ultimately will

189
00:11:51,750 --> 00:12:01,500
take you to fulfill your dream and this

190
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:07,410
is what I did step number one work in

191
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:13,700
the field that I want to work have you

192
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:13,699
heard about a key guy this word here

193
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:21,010
it's a term a Japanese word that means

194
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,700
what makes you wake up every or get up

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,600
every morning it became very famous

196
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:35,600
after TED talk I guess you're familiar

197
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,110
with TED talks they it was talked about

198
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,600
longevity they carried out a study and

199
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:45,410
they saw in which regions of the world

200
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,160
people lived longer and they saw there

201
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:53,120
was a bunch of Isles south of Japan

202
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:56,240
Okinawa region where people lived longer

203
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,910
it longer than the rest of Japan which

204
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,209
is the control with highest life

205
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:05,930
expectancy in the world and besides the

206
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:08,089
climate food and other factors one of

207
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:11,479
the factors that made these people live

208
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:14,660
longer is was that everyone had a clear

209
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,880
idea about their ikki guy the thing that

210
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:21,350
made him get up every morning later on

211
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,689
psychologists have developed this idea

212
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:29,779
and they say that EQI is the crossing

213
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:33,529
point for the combination of the things

214
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:36,140
you like things the work needs the

215
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:39,620
things you can be paid for the things

216
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:45,610
you're good at the crossing point

217
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:48,980
between these four areas is your ikigai

218
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:53,060
here's you we say passion your passion

219
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:54,890
your mission your vocation and your

220
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,589
profession if you combine these four

221
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,319
things and you can do that apparently

222
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:02,870
you're going to live longer in order to

223
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:06,479
find your ikigai

224
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:12,990
they say that you need to ask yourself

225
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:15,029
four questions first with which things

226
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,920
you feel really comfortable there are

227
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:19,079
people who feel really comfortable just

228
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,029
picking him in front of an audience but

229
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:27,719
for other people they have it's horrible

230
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:30,779
other people risky sports is really

231
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,570
great and for others well they would

232
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:35,339
never do it

233
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,649
another question with which activities

234
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:40,769
time goes by really quickly I'm sure

235
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:43,560
there are things that you started to do

236
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:47,850
them and time goes by very quickly it's

237
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,160
3:00 a.m. and you still sit in front of

238
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,050
your computer and you say oh I can't

239
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,240
believe I haven't realized how late it

240
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:59,790
is what things if I'd easy did well have

241
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,300
natural talents natural skills some

242
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:08,339
people draw perfectly well and others

243
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:10,800
like myself were poor drawers so the

244
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:15,000
natural abilities that define your et

245
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,910
guide for example I cannot prepare a

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,120
PowerPoint presentation I can't live it

247
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:24,839
the last question was what did you like

248
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,970
when you were a child that's very

249
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,940
important in order to discover your icky

250
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:32,990
guy as

251
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:37,550
we get older society teaches you things

252
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:39,530
they force you through towards the path

253
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,439
which is not necessarily yours but one

254
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,150
year kid you just thinks more naturally

255
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,290
and you devote your time to things that

256
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:52,459
make you happy in my case it was perfect

257
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:58,150
here when I was a kid I like this

258
00:15:52,460 --> 00:16:03,350
I was super freak and I was lucky

259
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:08,590
because when I was a kid my brother was

260
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:12,950
eight years older received this device

261
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:17,030
as a present and three months later he

262
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:20,170
was sent to a boarding school so I got

263
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,170
to keep the computer

264
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,050
I was very young back then I didn't have

265
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:35,120
games but I wanted to play with a

266
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:38,670
computer I had that book that handbook

267
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,670
with a series of games it was a knockin

268
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:45,810
idea need to edit it to copy it and once

269
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:48,870
you had copied you executed copy I mean

270
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,489
six seven pages of code and if it was

271
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:56,040
correctly copied you could execute it

272
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:58,530
and then you could play I didn't know

273
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,870
about print coat or anything similar I

274
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:04,280
just copied what was stated there and

275
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,280
then I could play my game

276
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:12,970
then we had the Golden Age of Spanish

277
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:16,090
software there were plenty of games you

278
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:20,560
could I could play with plenty of games

279
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:24,149
but that my mother bought me department

280
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,879
stores were in flea markets there were

281
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:29,470
cracked games they were like this it

282
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,660
looked like they were great with the

283
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,580
graphics the graphics back there were

284
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,350
more or less like this so there was a

285
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:43,240
difference between the cover and the

286
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:48,850
actual game and my first contact with a

287
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:51,220
hacking world was pokes this is before

288
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:54,990
the Internet era back then we didn't

289
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,990
have internet at home

290
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,340
and the only way we could access this

291
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:02,710
type of information with the magazines

292
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,988
that reach your neighborhood if you were

293
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:09,399
lucky because if they didn't you had to

294
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:14,559
go to the other part of the city to look

295
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:17,498
for the magazines this comes from the

296
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:22,720
English verb to poke which means to

297
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:26,830
change when you change memory address it

298
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:31,720
was code exceeder sibling cold and you

299
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:33,549
modified the game so that when he

300
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,489
detected that you had crash into your

301
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:39,749
enemy well it was as if you hadn't

302
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:45,849
crushed into it and things like that so

303
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:53,369
you can imagine after all of this when I

304
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:53,369
was 15 I was studying at high school I

305
00:18:53,489 --> 00:19:03,909
thought I was God with my Linux is

306
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:08,049
diskettes to install it I just watched

307
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:12,039
the film hackers I spent the whole

308
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:17,649
nights in IRC remote session I did

309
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:22,239
everything I could I used to tell my

310
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:24,879
parents I'm going to be self-taught

311
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,450
hacker a study and going to learn much

312
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:32,408
more than at university my mother was

313
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:35,799
terrified at the thought that his child

314
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:42,659
was going to end up in prison robbing

315
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:42,658
banks poor woman

316
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:50,800
and one day she said you're going to go

317
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:53,170
to university you didn't study computing

318
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,010
science so I went there to grandmother

319
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:58,900
to study that I didn't like it because I

320
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,510
want I wanted to be a self-taught hacker

321
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,320
but with time I thanked it because I

322
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:07,120
know the love of data structure

323
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,370
mathematics that were essential to

324
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,780
understand more complicated concepts

325
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:19,000
notes so the naps I took and the friends

326
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:24,760
I made we were a thinner in that picture

327
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:30,190
but that's us and I have nice memories

328
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:34,230
from that time we studied at University

329
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,230
for five years to you not bad

330
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:42,440
we didn't like going to class but we

331
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:47,240
managed to finish our studies in five

332
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,580
years but I wanted to continue in the

333
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,110
world of cybersecurity but unfortunately

334
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,620
yet another was not a good place for

335
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:58,159
that in 2006 the world the word

336
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:00,260
cybersecurity was not something you

337
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,760
would listen you would hear in Granada

338
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:09,200
so like many people from my class I had

339
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:12,200
to go to Madrid I started to work for a

340
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:18,980
consulting company and after a while I

341
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:21,470
received a job proposal a job offer in

342
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:25,370
which a job was offered and they

343
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:30,020
required knowledge about assembling

344
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:33,559
regular expressions and for me there was

345
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:38,179
the big up to nity so I went for it I

346
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:44,510
got it and I started to work there with

347
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:46,970
that orange book I remember then when

348
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:50,929
they told me that I was accepted

349
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:54,710
they sent me for PDF files for me to

350
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:56,950
read is for books and for me was the

351
00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:03,730
dream come true because I could finally

352
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:06,140
work in what I wanted my life was

353
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,670
simpler when I was a kid I used to play

354
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:09,990
football

355
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:14,280
perhaps I watched football with my

356
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:17,070
father and TB but I was it I had never

357
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:21,660
heard about cybersecurity I was doing

358
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:24,260
what I wanted but it's true that when

359
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,940
you're a child and adolescent a teenager

360
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,700
that's important for you there are some

361
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,350
things that happened and have a

362
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,430
consequence in the future I would say

363
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:41,790
there was mainly my parents my father

364
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:44,640
used to say this walk the talk I could

365
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,830
just say that I had studied but I had

366
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,600
fail the exam no he wanted hard facts

367
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,600
and your life you want facts

368
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,940
another thing my father said you have to

369
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:01,530
listen see and shut up you I would

370
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,510
change it I think you have to speak of

371
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:06,000
when it's the right time not at the

372
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:08,750
wrong time and this sentence is from my

373
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,670
mother nothing in the world can replace

374
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:15,030
being constant it doesn't matter how

375
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:18,179
good you are if we do not continue to

376
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:19,620
work in the world of cybersecurity what

377
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:22,200
we did 10 years ago is completely

378
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,479
different from now you have to recycle

379
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,240
yourself all the time so the education

380
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,910
received when you're a child even it has

381
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,970
nothing to do with cybersecurity it laid

382
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:35,760
the foundations for my training I've

383
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,770
always looked for challenge for

384
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,490
challenges I remember I was at school

385
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:44,309
and so I was very happy but I saw that I

386
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:49,650
received good marks even I didn't do a

387
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:51,840
good job I got bored and I remember that

388
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:59,280
when it was time to move on to high

389
00:23:51,840 --> 00:24:03,510
school I told my parents I was I wanted

390
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,840
to go to private to a public high school

391
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:12,750
I went there it was a very good for me

392
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:17,340
and my little brother went that high

393
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:19,500
school after me then picking up a degree

394
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:23,429
at University I studied computer science

395
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,410
speakers when I was in high school there

396
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,840
was a psychology there and he told me

397
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,180
okay you're going to become really rich

398
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,439
with computing science I didn't have

399
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:36,390
much I said okay why not

400
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:43,590
perhaps I think I've let myself low

401
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:45,630
until I I decided to to do what I was

402
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:47,490
going to do with my life I started to

403
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,710
work with a consulting company in Madrid

404
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,690
because they come to an employment fair

405
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,810
in Granada they showed us a job first

406
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,670
experience and back then it was quite

407
00:24:54,810 --> 00:25:02,370
fashionable working for a consulting

408
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:06,600
company we just spent the same six seven

409
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:12,030
months are you familiar with culture

410
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:15,360
over time well 12 years ago the cool

411
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:17,820
thing was staying after working hours

412
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,560
because other times it would look like

413
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:25,230
you were not you were not good enough

414
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:29,970
after while there I said these guys are

415
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:33,250
crazy and I wanted I left when my

416
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:38,289
working hours were over

417
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:41,669
and in consulting world the usual thing

418
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:44,440
was for bosses to be really hard on you

419
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:48,909
as I've said before my football team is

420
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,429
at lady and our trainer coach says the

421
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:55,620
people behave in the football pitch same

422
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:55,620
way they behave in the personal life I

423
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,710
think that this situation has changed a

424
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:07,060
lot

425
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:09,640
cyber what

426
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:15,909
after six months in a consulting company

427
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:18,010
my friend told me do you want to come

428
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,930
and work with me in cybersecurity

429
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:23,830
I said well I don't know maybe things

430
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:31,540
have changed a lot in CB was born in

431
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:33,939
2005 and this happened in 2007 no one

432
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,620
spoke about cybersecurity ever I knew

433
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,930
something a little bit between you know

434
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:44,020
having a beer with him perhaps he said

435
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:46,960
something but I had no clue about it why

436
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,600
did I go to cybersecurity what would

437
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:55,300
they paid more you work you're working

438
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:57,879
hours and you it wasn't frowned upon and

439
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,399
he said there are nice challenges here

440
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,080
you're just not copying and pasting and

441
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,100
a website for another client they're

442
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,639
very interesting things here so I liked

443
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:12,550
it we had with the power start

444
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,020
challenges we were given time to

445
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:19,090
understand products in product

446
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:22,090
assessments and I started to love it it

447
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:25,360
was the first time that I thought ok I

448
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:31,090
could work in this it's very interesting

449
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:33,449
and my past was basically playing

450
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,449
football

451
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:51,119
met Rita was nice I think I went every

452
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:54,389
possible theatre musicals don't get

453
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:57,449
fooled his wife lived the south of Spain

454
00:27:54,389 --> 00:28:01,049
yes my wife lived in south of Spain and

455
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:07,889
I had a dream I wanted to do this but in

456
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:12,359
the south of Spain not in Madrid so the

457
00:28:07,889 --> 00:28:16,649
date came closer I worked in Madrid for

458
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:18,839
five years I learned what it was getting

459
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:20,939
up early in the morning in order to go

460
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:26,789
to work

461
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:30,529
traffic jams managing teams teaching

462
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:34,469
people junior people learning from

463
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:36,989
people with more experience being humble

464
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:40,820
and accepting that there are people that

465
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:40,820
much better than you are

466
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,610
that those were things that had to learn

467
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:53,189
and those here in Madrid

468
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:55,320
they were very useful for me then I was

469
00:28:53,190 --> 00:29:01,620
lucky to work with Xhosa they were

470
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:04,889
friends from from University those if

471
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:09,770
you have done things like this one there

472
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:14,460
are few feelings which can compare to

473
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:18,540
overcome a challenge we dance when we

474
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:22,260
make made something explode over making

475
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:27,020
something overflow and we had fun a lot

476
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:34,110
of fun but time went by and one day I

477
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:36,270
said this is it and I quit I am I had a

478
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:39,179
good salary a promising career but it's

479
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:44,970
not what I wanted so with the contacts I

480
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:49,950
made I wanted to I went to run Anna and

481
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:52,260
I had a part-time job in bio tronic my

482
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:54,870
sister-in-law's company well that's life

483
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:56,620
she worked in microcontrollers and I

484
00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:00,010
helped her

485
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:03,300
and at the same time the other part of

486
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:08,740
my day was devoted to cybersecurity

487
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:11,919
consulting as a freelance so I could

488
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,660
work in something I liked in the city

489
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:18,280
and light in the middle of the crisis so

490
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:20,620
he was very brave and I was with my

491
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:26,850
girlfriend back then she's my wife today

492
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:29,500
so it was great wonderful years however

493
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,600
there's something that they don't tell

494
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,540
you when you decide to become an

495
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,050
entrepreneur and it's paperwork you're

496
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:40,379
not aware of how how many things we have

497
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,379
today

498
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:47,949
since you're self-taught yourself taught

499
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:51,900
for everything and you don't go to a tax

500
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:58,179
advisor you study the law Social

501
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:59,940
Security the tax forms everything

502
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:02,740
self-taught

503
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:05,930
well I received some fines because I

504
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:08,360
made mistakes in my paperwork

505
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:11,240
and besides there was the commercial

506
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,250
side of it I needed someone to sell

507
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:18,500
myself I'm not good at selling myself

508
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:20,510
I'm good at the gate board and I

509
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,260
realized that I needed help

510
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:30,920
what did I do I heard another friend

511
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:35,450
from university his company has just had

512
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:37,520
just went into bankruptcy and I realized

513
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:41,990
that he did the cool things and I was

514
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:45,190
his salesperson I did the paperwork but

515
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,190
he did the coolest things

516
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:56,850
I spent seven years doing technical

517
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:59,129
things but at some point every time I

518
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:01,679
woke up in the morning was worth because

519
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:06,120
then a little boy when they have to go

520
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:08,550
to school I'd liked learning I had the

521
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,129
foundations but I was bored and you

522
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,840
don't know how sad it is to wake up at

523
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:16,770
the morning in order to go to work

524
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:22,590
without wanting to you and I wanted

525
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:25,550
something else I wanted to lead teams I

526
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:28,530
wanted to move forward as a professional

527
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:33,450
and I remember one of my bosses he said

528
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:34,920
just a soldier and I said well that's

529
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:39,480
hot and the sahabis

530
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:41,820
says it was a good salary good working

531
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,250
hours when I explained this to my

532
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,419
friends it laughed at me they said

533
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,570
what's your problem

534
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:52,880
you're privileged person perhaps I was

535
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:52,879
but every morning it was very hard

536
00:32:53,309 --> 00:33:00,250
and my god an angel came to me it was

537
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:03,549
LinkedIn I would have never thought of

538
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:07,809
sending surveys to companies in the

539
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:12,760
industry and one day a company called me

540
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:15,660
and they said it was a competitive and

541
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:19,150
they said do you want to be in charge

542
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:21,490
the Common Criteria who service but

543
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:24,549
beginning I said that crazy what do they

544
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,260
see in myself now nowadays link eating

545
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:30,460
is it's a very common thing but four

546
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:33,640
five years ago wasn't that common in

547
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:39,750
fact they coded us through LinkedIn but

548
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:44,650
they called the the company they called

549
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:47,799
my company and asked for me and that's

550
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:50,140
how many adventure was born in your life

551
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:53,530
I would say

552
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,540
they told me that I had to be a

553
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,970
technical manager I'd said that's

554
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:02,879
perfect

555
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,879
I have the project

556
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,080
I help with the projects I had trouble

557
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,489
at the beginning it was really cool once

558
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,889
you start to travel all the time you

559
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:14,770
didn't like it that much but I was young

560
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:18,010
so I had everything in control managing

561
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:22,179
teams it was okay I like being with

562
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:26,080
people I like that part but no one told

563
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:29,230
me that I need to you carry out cell

564
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,460
tasks the first week when I arrived they

565
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,310
said tomorrow we have a meeting with

566
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:35,980
some Chinese guys and we need to sell

567
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:40,540
this to them what do you know who you've

568
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:44,710
hired perhaps you're wrong and no one

569
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:52,210
ever trained me about how to sell and

570
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:56,668
now I sell my company's services so my

571
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,668
only solution was being myself

572
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,610
I'm not interested at selling techniques

573
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,800
what I did back then and what I do now

574
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:11,640
was being honest with people being

575
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:13,710
myself before explaining offering before

576
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,049
explaining a problem I had to make my

577
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:18,540
problem mine and then I had to provide

578
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:21,210
my client with solutions I have a story

579
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,490
with a client from Israel they called on

580
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:28,470
a Sunday they were very angry we guess

581
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:30,779
we had made a big mistake and we

582
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:33,629
accepted it we started work on it we

583
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,160
solved it and that same client has

584
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:38,270
continued to work with us because he

585
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,270
would say perhaps

586
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:46,020
someone else would have blame others

587
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:48,510
read the small things in the contracts

588
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,339
but we just accepted reality there's

589
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,890
been a failure we fail all the time

590
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:56,339
cobby tells me I'm bipolar I say one

591
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:59,490
thing then he talks to me and then I

592
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:07,200
changed my view and I say it's okay I've

593
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:09,629
just changed my mind I tried to be

594
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,089
myself all the time I happen to prepare

595
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:17,220
this talk we made the slides

596
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:22,180
representation and then I go with the

597
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:25,879
flow and that's how I like to do things

598
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:28,370
so when I arrived there they told me my

599
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,280
position was common critique criteria

600
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:34,130
leader I thought my boss is crazy how

601
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,440
could he come up with his name I still

602
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:39,190
think that he was a bit crazy a very

603
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,190
good person though

604
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:49,690
and one day he said this and for me it

605
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:53,950
was quite affirmative ation he was

606
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:56,530
motivated to see that people below him

607
00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:03,279
in the company he was motivated to see

608
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:05,620
them grow I'm sure he's happy for me and

609
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,890
I have that with people working with me

610
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:11,380
I always try that they grow to make them

611
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:16,799
grow and if you manage to start in the

612
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,800
future you'll see how satisfactory it is

613
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:30,450
I love the job but the truth is that

614
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:32,549
sometimes you love it so much that well

615
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:37,020
sometimes I thought they come the money

616
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:44,450
earned by the company was mine have you

617
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:44,450
ever seen this video have you seen it

618
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:56,170
that's how I felt when I was given the

619
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,170
job

620
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,939
[Music]

621
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,799
when I was given the BlackBerry my

622
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,480
company's blackberry I felt like this

623
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:22,430
you're just no one with a blackberry

624
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,599
that's it

625
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:28,848
and for a while I was that and if you

626
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:33,339
haven't worked in the consulting

627
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:33,339
industry well I believe that

628
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:43,660
so I saw that my life was not a normal

629
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:46,330
one it was very important to have a

630
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:49,359
personal life to have a balance and with

631
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:52,390
the what does I have in my company I

632
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,299
have weird office hours because I'm

633
00:38:52,390 --> 00:39:00,220
taking care of my kid and I sent emails

634
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:03,790
at weird hours and when they answer me

635
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,500
at that time I get angry because I say

636
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:08,740
you shouldn't be answering that at that

637
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:18,369
time you need to protect your personal

638
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:19,779
life you know it's hobbies turn Y Jose

639
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:25,660
was living

640
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:27,160
there's experiences I was working with

641
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,490
the friend I had

642
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:35,799
where did cool things we had some sort

643
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:39,250
of infrastructure but we were working in

644
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,220
a small room in my flat it was our

645
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:47,260
office was not a garage but it was the

646
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:51,069
idea it was like Bill Gates garage yes

647
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:57,460
where it was second floor at some point

648
00:39:51,070 --> 00:40:00,670
I wanted to do something else I wanted

649
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:04,330
to stop being under a Raider I wanted to

650
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:07,390
start doing bigger things

651
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:10,420
and also I was given the opportunity to

652
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:13,230
be a teacher in the master's degree in

653
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:18,280
cybersecurity the University of Granada

654
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:22,710
so I thought that the pieces started to

655
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,710
fit together to do something bigger

656
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,810
Arvind

657
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,670
talking to cross it for a while saying

658
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,920
well why don't don't we create something

659
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:37,320
together we've worked and we were a good

660
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,780
team and he represented the commercial

661
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:42,450
side of things he had the ability of

662
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:46,050
talking to clients and he has a good

663
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:49,160
technical background so partly the

664
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:50,820
pieces of this puzzle will fit him

665
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,569
little by little

666
00:40:50,820 --> 00:41:01,170
he hasn't said that he was very scared

667
00:40:54,570 --> 00:41:05,010
at creating a company and I had a bit of

668
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:06,450
a disappointment I think that first you

669
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:10,170
have to give and then you have to

670
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:12,359
receive but requesting well if you just

671
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:15,210
paint two months in a company you can't

672
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,250
request I like things to come naturally

673
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,320
after two years the company had grown a

674
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:23,700
lot the department decided not to

675
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:26,190
increase my salary I said okay I have to

676
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:28,109
travel less and say okay Jose better and

677
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,460
Monty please come to Barcelona because

678
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,150
we have a very important meeting

679
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,910
I requested more resources for more

680
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:37,859
people and there were promises that were

681
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:41,940
never fulfilled at some point I felt

682
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:44,790
like was being a fool we weren't

683
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:47,680
thinking and being interpreters

684
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:52,020
just life brought me here

685
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,020
but at some point I took the decision

686
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,460
Abby and I hadn't discussed the details

687
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,829
about work was going to a group we were

688
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:03,339
going to grade but I said that's it

689
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:09,700
enough is enough I called my boss and I

690
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:11,890
told him there's a set I quit I exploded

691
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:16,089
but in a controlled way you have to be

692
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:20,740
very elegant in life into my old company

693
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:23,700
well they hire us it's our main customer

694
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:27,189
why because I left with elegance I

695
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,558
worked for five months in the company

696
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,390
after saying that was living she lived

697
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:37,089
things in order I think you always have

698
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:40,509
to be elegant so we started to talk more

699
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:42,609
seriously with Hobby we had to make our

700
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:46,420
calculations we have a couple of napkins

701
00:42:42,609 --> 00:42:50,619
our business plan was very simple

702
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:53,890
because it was just being brave but I

703
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:56,980
had doubts what happens if it goes wrong

704
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:59,710
I had worked in two most important

705
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,980
companies in the field ad we were

706
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:07,869
working I saw I had to go abroad but I

707
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:10,450
wanted to stay in Spain and then a

708
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:13,869
foreign multinational company offered me

709
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:16,450
to work from home and I said well there

710
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:21,270
are other opportunities out there I

711
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:24,750
never thought about that then

712
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:30,090
I decided to go on a holiday and well

713
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:33,050
when your holiday is that is almost good

714
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:38,280
Freddy and at that time I was reading

715
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:42,960
that book as a working week of four

716
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:47,280
hours and then well I will did not stick

717
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:52,920
to that to those four hour quickly hours

718
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:56,160
oh and then there is a list in this book

719
00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:00,150
about advantages and disadvantages and

720
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:07,649
everyone talks about entrepreneurship so

721
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:09,660
since but we have some saved money so

722
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:13,230
those people who become entrepreneurs

723
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:15,240
and they ask her to the bank for a loan

724
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:18,060
and everything they are very

725
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,370
praiseworthy but we didn't we didn't do

726
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:24,720
that we didn't have to do that and this

727
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:28,410
is javi and then well he decided to quit

728
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:32,040
his job and then to go into partnership

729
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:36,390
and then to set up our company and well

730
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:42,080
he at the end I twisted his hand and we

731
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:42,080
assess a setup our company

732
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:53,920
what is that it's it's

733
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:56,329
it's a problem with a presentation okay

734
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,490
do you know that the more effect is

735
00:44:56,329 --> 00:45:03,859
exactly the same thing and as I say we

736
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:06,200
started to build the team because I was

737
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:11,359
teaching the cybersecurity master's

738
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:18,558
course then we offered people to come

739
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:22,249
and work with us and then we also hired

740
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:28,160
someone to take care of administration

741
00:45:22,249 --> 00:45:31,069
and say well bureaucracy okay and then

742
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,910
well hobby was from Granada

743
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:37,099
he lived in antequera he wanted to

744
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:41,089
create the company set up the company in

745
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:45,140
antequera someone else ed and then we

746
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:47,538
also sort about Malaga as possible days

747
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:51,460
for our company and then in the end we

748
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:51,460
decided for Granada

749
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:58,770
and I continue to live in Madrid who

750
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,570
knows perhaps in few years some things

751
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:05,640
will change but nowadays many of there

752
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:08,040
is a significant business activity in

753
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:11,690
Madrid so therefore we have that

754
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:19,830
structure will have the actual office in

755
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:21,510
Ranade and based in Madrid so I love

756
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:22,950
living here in the south of his brain

757
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:25,310
here in the South of his face very easy

758
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:28,740
for me to go for a few drinks with

759
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:31,770
friends and well it doesn't ever

760
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:35,310
happened to me in Madrid ok so I'm not

761
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:38,810
going to go and live in Madrid so what

762
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:41,850
are we doing nowadays and what do we do

763
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:44,120
well I take care of relationship with

764
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,120
customers

765
00:46:49,580 --> 00:47:00,060
well another the other jobs are ihara

766
00:46:52,860 --> 00:47:03,570
also worked indeed lots of teamwork our

767
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:07,430
company's a very small company our sales

768
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:10,950
force is just about building up great

769
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,419
working groups and what this is what I

770
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,330
do

771
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:18,120
teamwork building up good teams and

772
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:21,509
doing good team work and then as much as

773
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:25,230
possible we try to deliver presentations

774
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:27,060
to attend conferences so that to make

775
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:30,240
ourselves known because we do not have

776
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:33,000
any sales reps in our company we also

777
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,359
give very good level of service to our

778
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,250
clients to our teams I treat them the

779
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,560
way I would like them to treat me

780
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:43,650
now I also like to have a life other

781
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:48,900
than my professional life I spend time

782
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:52,110
with my kids the time that I could not

783
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:55,650
spend with my kids if I were to work for

784
00:47:52,110 --> 00:48:00,000
a multinational company I pray so

785
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:02,820
they're my clients pay me on time or

786
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,210
Juli and then what do I do

787
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:08,040
well I have fun breaking things this is

788
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:10,890
something that I always wanted to do now

789
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:14,370
I'm doing it and I also lead a team of

790
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:18,200
hackers which is even better fun there

791
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:18,200
being a hacker yourself

792
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:31,598
and then we also do R&D we do well small

793
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:39,910
research we know that this is important

794
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:41,710
for team-building and now it again well

795
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:44,230
because of research and development that

796
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,210
we do we are offered to give

797
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:49,119
presentations at conferences and

798
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:55,630
congresses and we also take part in

799
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:58,540
competitions such as CTF well at the end

800
00:48:55,630 --> 00:49:03,599
of the day our company is driven by

801
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:07,779
three values technical excellence also

802
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:11,170
commitment with our clients in some of

803
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:15,880
the projects that we carry out we lose

804
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:18,250
money and but we are sure that we want

805
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,920
to implement that project with work with

806
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:25,380
that client and then time to market this

807
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:29,980
is what we offer as competitive edge and

808
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:34,089
these are the outside values but when we

809
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:36,940
decided to create our company we decided

810
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:39,310
also to stick to a number of internal

811
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:42,640
values so the first project our be

812
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:44,799
carried out together was in Malaysia so

813
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:49,598
the two of us decided to fly over there

814
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:52,750
12 hour flies than a few years later we

815
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:58,270
were in Thailand Thailand and then in

816
00:49:52,750 --> 00:50:00,480
that in the trip to Thailand we decided

817
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:03,359
to

818
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,990
write down the ten values that we

819
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:09,750
believed were cool for our company and

820
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:13,609
then in the end we end up with this

821
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:17,339
Decalogue with this list of ten values

822
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:19,230
so having these values in place is very

823
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:24,060
very important because sometimes you are

824
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:26,070
very busy and then you tend to forget so

825
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:28,740
if we ever forget we come back to those

826
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:35,060
values and these are values that we also

827
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:37,890
share and communicate with our employees

828
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:45,740
so we just don't want our company to be

829
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:49,290
just pure machine to make money and now

830
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:52,848
tips for successful company be

831
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:56,960
surrounded by the best people the thing

832
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:59,010
in all the projects you require to have

833
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,470
multidisciplinary team someone who is

834
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:05,130
well hartle-hawking the other one who

835
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:09,359
knows about reversing other is about

836
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:13,140
exploring so it is just impossible to

837
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:15,569
know it all also motivating your

838
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:20,190
employees help them growth make them

839
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:22,579
growth something our company there are

840
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:25,190
ready to people who have already

841
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:27,900
delivered presentations are hacking

842
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:30,420
conferences

843
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,579
so we wanted to go back to their

844
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:35,069
families and to feel proud of the

845
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:38,249
company where the work and to speak good

846
00:51:35,069 --> 00:51:44,819
of ourselves or the company they work in

847
00:51:38,249 --> 00:51:48,419
and then we never had any disruptive

848
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:51,839
idea any breakthrough idea about any

849
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:54,539
breakthrough product will have our

850
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,328
business model we believed that we can

851
00:51:54,539 --> 00:52:01,549
be better than our competitors and this

852
00:51:57,329 --> 00:52:05,819
is what has taken as where we are now

853
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:07,650
look for challenges for challenges of

854
00:52:05,819 --> 00:52:10,319
the time you need to challenge in

855
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:17,490
yourself worth the time has to keep

856
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:19,799
going - so now we have now turned up Tim

857
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:22,709
welcome we will be taking part in the

858
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:24,839
European lympha series for the last

859
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:28,170
month I've been the problem director of

860
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:30,900
two congresses we are all the time doing

861
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:32,880
new things things that help us to drive

862
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:36,900
ourselves to develop ourselves

863
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:40,140
professionally so not always things are

864
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:44,670
take place immediately thinking in the

865
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:46,589
long term is always important you have

866
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:49,200
to be elegant you have to be sure that

867
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:52,799
what you will do today will bear fruits

868
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:57,180
tomorrow if you treat a client badly if

869
00:52:52,799 --> 00:53:01,249
you treat an employee badly you will see

870
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:06,118
the negative impacts of it very soon

871
00:53:01,249 --> 00:53:08,609
taking risks but with some control with

872
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:12,810
some level of control it is good to make

873
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:14,850
decisions but timely the right time

874
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:18,420
mainly well you want to become

875
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:20,819
entrepreneurs and then but perfect but

876
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:24,060
be entrepreneurs when you are ready for

877
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:26,610
it when you have all the necessary basis

878
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:28,950
for it there well many startups are

879
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:32,400
created but many of them also fail very

880
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:35,790
soon after being created and I feel that

881
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:39,570
that could be really disappointing also

882
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:45,360
her wealth firmament takeaway message go

883
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:49,200
for that that you actually love so we

884
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:51,540
may get trained that they finish

885
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:56,009
training at 20:20 result and get retired

886
00:53:51,540 --> 00:54:00,810
at 65 life expectancy is set at 84 years

887
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:06,360
old so it means that you will spend 42

888
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:12,420
years at work working looking forward

889
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:15,990
for Friday and time off so balance

890
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:21,190
between work life working life that is

891
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:24,009
just essential believe it

892
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:31,180
this mic Hut you have to believe it

893
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:31,859
yourself be yourself clients like that a

894
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:35,848
lot

895
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:45,250
the other day I was with a client was

896
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:47,589
and he told me well he so he just played

897
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:52,630
the same joke and I said I just don't

898
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:56,950
want to work with this person and then

899
00:54:52,630 --> 00:55:00,220
the markets globally say trouble markets

900
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:03,578
you can do good cybersecurity from

901
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:09,689
malama from security from Granada from

902
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:13,180
your small town 80% of our invoicing

903
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:16,230
turnover comes from work that we do

904
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,230
outside of Spain

905
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:27,670
so Grenada is a good base for our

906
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:29,740
company but very very agency that we all

907
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:34,350
have learning English speaking English

908
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:34,350
you have to have a good level of English

909
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:43,440
and this is my personal tip improvise

910
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:46,630
when you improvise something things flow

911
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:52,990
when you see a problem when you see

912
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:56,710
challenge go by your guts okay and this

913
00:55:52,990 --> 00:56:01,810
is something that your clients also can

914
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:05,320
see and appreciate and do those things

915
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:07,259
your mother would be proud of if my

916
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:10,900
mother were to understand what I do

917
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:15,220
surely she would be very proud of me so

918
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:18,160
this year I delivered a presentation in

919
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:20,529
a conference and my parents went over to

920
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,990
Canada to see me delivering that speech

921
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:26,860
and they were extremely satisfied and

922
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:30,279
well thank you very much for putting up

923
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:33,280
with us up until now so we wish you all

924
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:36,490

925
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:41,220
in life and then well as long as you are

926
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:41,220
