[Music]

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,750
you

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:14,520
[Music]

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,130
Oh No me llamo Jose Ignacio

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,200
good morning my name is Jose Tanana

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,860
we'll be sharing with you the design of

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,160
a platform for cybersecurity sinners we

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:33,000
aimed our learning and training well

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:35,010
this is me I am an IT engineer and my

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,790
participation in the world of cyber

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,370
security has been through CTF

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:46,950
competition challenges etc I have taken

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:51,030
part in the European cyber security

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,250
challenges in 2016 and 2017 the first

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,430
one was held in Dusseldorf and the

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:00,830
second one here in 2017 in Malaga

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:03,379
actually we were the winners so we had a

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:08,070
great time okay

19
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:12,090
and then now CTF cyber camp which will

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:15,270
be held this Saturday I participated in

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:19,080
all the editions and I want the warning

22
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,929
2015 and I was second T in the 2017 so

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,229
therefore I am very much due to take

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:29,820
part in competitions in hacking and CTF

25
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:32,220
set cetera and well this is related to

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,919
the platform that I will be sharing with

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,370
you this is me this is a company where I

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,530
work SGS accessories companies a

29
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:45,650
multinational company its present in

30
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:49,920
1066 and it employs some 400,000 people

31
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:52,409
why a platform of these characteristics

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,130
well previous speaker told us that in

33
00:01:52,409 --> 00:02:00,070
the Spain or well all over the world

34
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:03,280
the attitudes of people working in the

35
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:06,548
field of security is extremely important

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,818
and then the aptitude and the attitude

37
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:12,880
has to be focused on in learning in

38
00:02:09,818 --> 00:02:15,700
training in cybersecurity do you have to

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,340
get training and then and that training

40
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,920
requires having a number of resources so

41
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,709
this is not about studying only this is

42
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,470
not theory so every one part

43
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:29,650
well little creatures plumbers very many

44
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,530
professions have to put things into

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,480
practice have to practice and we have to

46
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,610
practice at a cybersecurity world so

47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,929
that's what I have said active platform

48
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:42,519
offering see simulation and sense

49
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,920
platforms or scenario similar to those

50
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,390
that we will be facing in the real life

51
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,328
that here we have two elements

52
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,819
scalability and final costs well for

53
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:53,590
perhaps for company's cost is not a

54
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:56,380
significant problem but in the world of

55
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:59,140
Education cost is a crucial factor and

56
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:02,950
this is what I try to optimize the my

57
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,988
platform and I believe that cyber

58
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,630
security training is based on three

59
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,760
pillars nowadays there are very many

60
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,799
well-known days and in this sector there

61
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,590
are many self-taught people there are

62
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,769
very many competitions competitions are

63
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:20,410
helped us learn a lot and also we have

64
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:22,870
university training University training

65
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,420
it's getting better and better in this

66
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,540
new field it is quite new fields and

67
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,690
then the universities are adapting to

68
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:35,590
real world but still we have

69
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:39,990
small gap between University and real

70
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:42,910
life and then we also have professional

71
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,790
certifications and I believe that these

72
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:50,230
are the three pillars when it comes to

73
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:52,440
cyber security training so no well there

74
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:58,630
are other challenges platforms out there

75
00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:01,570
where people learn all by doing a very

76
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,290
much like hack the Box platform I'm sure

77
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:08,380
many of you have tried it out have

78
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:10,630
several challenges and work to it to me

79
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:13,810
this is a significant source of learning

80
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:16,149
very interesting ok so what is the focus

81
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,930
of hack the Box well has a base with

82
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:22,299
thousands of users and these users are

83
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,960
updating contents all the time so there

84
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:29,850
is a new washing every single week at

85
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:33,489
5:00 p.m. every Saturday new content is

86
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:37,000
included or offered so these are virtual

87
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,310
machines well has number implications

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,140
that we will refer to later on but to

89
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,790
summarize there is a high cost of

90
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,120
infrastructure we wanted to replicate

91
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:48,310
this model at a university so now it is

92
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,850
the business model of hacked box this is

93
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,460
based on a subscription so you have the

94
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,400
option of not paying anything and to

95
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:02,169
share to share a scenario of machines

96
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,479
with very many other users some but

97
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:08,550
sometimes sharing some of those machines

98
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:12,370
is an actual problem is a big problem

99
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:16,960
well your training capability is quite

100
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:21,880
reduced however you may go subscribe to

101
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:25,870
it and you share that laughed at a

102
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,730
scenario with 20 people the problem with

103
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,980
this type of a scenario is that the

104
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,180
advancements and progression of people

105
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:35,110
you are sharing the platter

106
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:39,310
we may either benefit you or be a bit

107
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:43,450
well detrimental for you but anyway it's

108
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:46,120
a moral it's a modern which I feel is

109
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,039
good and the problem a fear is the high

110
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,560
cost of it if you want to implement it

111
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,940
yourself and then also another downside

112
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:59,070
this is not an open platform some

113
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:04,570
motivation for me to work in the

114
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:06,849
platform I was doing the dissertation at

115
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,040
the end of my Master's course and then I

116
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,980
decided to focus on this topic for my

117
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,400
dissertation so the challenges platforms

118
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,290
that are open source do not manage the

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,060
infrastructure of the challenges that is

120
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,230
to say the virtualization

121
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:27,340
these platforms only manage these corpus

122
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:31,570
how to insert the flags but they do not

123
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,450
manage the challenge infrastructure and

124
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:37,770
then there are also other of the shelfs

125
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:40,390
platforms I would not say out any names

126
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:43,000
I've tried some of them and actually

127
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:46,140
I've juiced some of them in competitions

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,500
very sustained here at incident but they

129
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:54,099
leave a lot to be desired

130
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:59,980
they are not that good so therefore I

131
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:02,440
decided to improve whatever is available

132
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,200
up there and I said well is this

133
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:09,010
business opportunity well I decided to

134
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:12,700
go for it and I'm quite happy with the

135
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:17,360
outcome so this is the work that was

136
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:19,940
presented at the GIC 2018

137
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,759
we got a diploma so it's in the word to

138
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,030
the first the best article about

139
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:29,000
training and innovation so now let us

140
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,280
move on into the platform and its design

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,310
well the technical architecture

142
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,330
technology just is quite simple which

143
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:43,099
works is based on NYNEX

144
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:47,740
the front-end is its angular GTS its

145
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:50,150
angular GA s so I have thought about

146
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,069
rewriting it in a different technology

147
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:57,440
Google or other but that will be in the

148
00:07:52,069 --> 00:08:00,919
future and now I want to shift it into

149
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,789
something which is can be compiled but

150
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:07,698
the prototype that we use is no Delta J

151
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:09,650
s and angularjs and the performance of

152
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,349
far so good so in terms of

153
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:16,128
virtualization maneuvering costs the

154
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:19,610
main proposal is using docker containers

155
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,680
these implies many things so we should

156
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,909
be based on Linux it is lightweight and

157
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:30,110
it is scalable and as it is designs can

158
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:33,140
be configured in from module of cluster

159
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,959
module it is plain and simple so the

160
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:39,229
platform allows you to set up many

161
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:41,779
parallel servers when we say many we

162
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:46,149
refer to four or five remember that the

163
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,149
objective here is to lower costs and

164
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:55,230
it is an API rest controlling the

165
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:58,490
infrastructure very easy to implement at

166
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,020
university you will Francis with

167
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,480
authentication at University features

168
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,420
and everything and then it proposes a

169
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,630
standard design of scenario so everyone

170
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:15,209
knows how to do token any students who

171
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:21,000
want to produce dissertation can provide

172
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:25,860
content to the to this platform so well

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,260
there are also some sausages only few

174
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,560
platforms can be virtualized but well we

175
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:36,540
are not talking about virtualizing here

176
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:39,930
well perhaps Linux and Windows 2016 you

177
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,770
may introduce applications that network

178
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,969
but there are many possibilities

179
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:48,449
alternatives are also proposed through

180
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:52,920
support other platforms the main problem

181
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:54,750
is the kernel is shared any kind from

182
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,329
durability makes your platform

183
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:01,530
vulnerable and you cannot depositors in

184
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:04,680
the scenario because it doesn't give you

185
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:09,300
the necessary protection or installation

186
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:14,069
but here we find an offset in between

187
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:16,829
comic how hard it is for you to make it

188
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,900
and but you can do for instance P

189
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:22,500
because if a student is doing something

190
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:26,819
which should not be doing okay well you

191
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,790
can also get to know about it so it is

192
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,630
quite an acceptable trade-off ok you

193
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,900
know what people are

194
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:38,680
doing with it it is like copying in an

195
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:41,410
exam okay and now well we will be

196
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,430
discussing ot later on because this is

197
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:48,640
an interesting proposition

198
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:51,489
IOT devices can be used through a shift

199
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,710
system often will have five devices from

200
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,630
the same model and students will

201
00:10:53,710 --> 00:11:01,090
candidates or those who are getting

202
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:04,720
training have to share these devices and

203
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:07,840
then also hack the box model so while it

204
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,600
is known as booting fruit and it is a

205
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,240
virtual machine with a snap shell and

206
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,060
then you configure the challenge and you

207
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,280
may reset it as many times as possible

208
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,140
to reset it over and over and then you

209
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,530
set up five or six in parallel for each

210
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,750
scenario but as well that means that the

211
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,120
cost will grow exponentially

212
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,910
but if needed the platform would also

213
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,760
support it and then we have

214
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,709
infrastructure as a service why having

215
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,980
no convert realization when you can

216
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:41,110
start the machines when the students or

217
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,780
whoever is getting training needs them

218
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,990
so if you need a hundred machines for

219
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:49,120
three minutes or 40 minutes then you

220
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,790
will be invoiced only for those 40

221
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,780
minutes and then the platform will be

222
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:58,660
internet dated with the i-s platform

223
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,150
whether it is Amazon or you name it okay

224
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,410
so this is idea it is not fully finished

225
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:07,810
but it is quite simple to implement

226
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,790
logical architecture well but it is

227
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,410
important first of all to have the logic

228
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,530
of the competition and then on the other

229
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,510
hand the logic to manage the

230
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:20,319
infrastructure and which is the main

231
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,780
driver for this project some recent

232
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,930
improvements feels that a jet already

233
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:30,480
tested and tested them in Luzerne Swiss

234
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:32,640
Swiss Atlanta the past weekend and my

235
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,370
well if the

236
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,430
allow me I would like to implement it

237
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,410
the Polytechnic University in Madrid

238
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,989
support for virtual machine

239
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,640
infrastructure-as-a-service

240
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,190
controlling costs well we will see

241
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,130
whether we will succeed in that then a

242
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,769
number of a couple of keys have been

243
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:55,620
generated for the equipment everything

244
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:57,839
is unified well two keys will allow you

245
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,410
to access all the scenarios all the

246
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,950
challenges also it automatically manages

247
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:07,439
the VPN access if needed for instance

248
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,060
indirect as the Polytechnic University

249
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,329
will put the Technical University Madrid

250
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:15,630
Wi-Fi is available to students so not

251
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:18,269
all the ports of entry or inbound or

252
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,950
outbound ports are open so how do we

253
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:23,250
resolve that will resolve that through

254
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:25,950
VPN VPN allows us to control all the

255
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,740
activity that is carried out on the

256
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:33,180
platform we can produce analytics we can

257
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,740
produce retrieval interesting data so

258
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,569
well this has been integrated in the

259
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,490
platform it's up and running and works

260
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:43,829
very well and then supports first

261
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:48,690
physical devices and I hire a hardware

262
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:51,859
side channeling et cetera and management

263
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,860
of the different shifts

264
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:59,189
now let us look at the scenarios that

265
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,040
are supported by the platform especially

266
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,370
the docker model and we start off with

267
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:08,760
the most simple environments okay so

268
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:14,370
containers is started they use a long

269
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:15,630
time against that container so to decide

270
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,820
the challenge system the only

271
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,160
requirement is that the docker container

272
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,830
but you may have whatever you want to

273
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,160
have in it but it will have entry node

274
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:29,160
in the one three three seven port and

275
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,640
then the user will have to log on to

276
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,290
this URL and to this port have random

277
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:38,490
port and every time to start the

278
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:41,750
scenario the port changes and then what

279
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,760
different ports four different equipment

280
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,560
so this provides us an insulation

281
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,170
between the different isolates the

282
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,060
different devices but all the members of

283
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,860
the team I can access to the same

284
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,640
scenario to the same container so that

285
00:14:52,860 --> 00:15:01,620
they can work in parallel all on the

286
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:04,319
same container so this is what we was

287
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,120
very much decided and then we attempted

288
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,830
this is very simple you can do that in

289
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,950
ten minutes you don't need a platform to

290
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:14,700
manage that for you but what is actually

291
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:17,580
interesting is this Wellum this more

292
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:20,220
complex setup I hope you can read it so

293
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,990
you have entry point in the scenario and

294
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,000
then the scenario have several network

295
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,540
with several containers in this case so

296
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,280
do you go into SSH container or through

297
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:33,810
the web and then you pivot from there

298
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:35,339
and then you escalate privileges in that

299
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,959
machine then you move on to the other

300
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,880
users you get more information from the

301
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,920
other you said you move on to remain

302
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,290
access to the second network and only

303
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,510
through the container the user cannot

304
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,270
access that network through the device

305
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,069
has to call mandatory through this

306
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,319
intermediary node and then there are

307
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:56,930
other services and other visible

308
00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:00,000
containers that led you to access more

309
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:03,209
networks and how to

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,550
design these exercises well in theory

311
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,770
this is quite simple you have festival

312
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,750
to define the networks that you have the

313
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,449
networks to which each container is

314
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:17,690
knocked in and then an entry point and

315
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:24,120
the entry point has to go through 1 3 3

316
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:27,810
1 3 3 7 port which simplifies content

317
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,150
management and now the complexity and

318
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,000
well at the end of the day cost okay

319
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:36,180
which is were driving this project

320
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,340
so all these depends on the complexity

321
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:42,079
of this scenario because we are talking

322
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:47,940
about containers is is quite can be

323
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:50,040
easily scaled so at the end of the day

324
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,390
you will have students grouped in three

325
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,370
or four teams so at the end of the day

326
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,050
training professionals working

327
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,420
individually well that's a different

328
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,459
story that we are not talking about now

329
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,280
so to summarize at the end of the day

330
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,130
you will have less than 80 teams less

331
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:12,079
than 80 instances in this scenario I'm

332
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:14,640
trolly this scenario in the best case

333
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,188
but at the end of the day we will have

334
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,280
in like eight containers so it is cheap

335
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:25,350
it is cheap in terms of resources in

336
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:27,660
terms of machines so an example change

337
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:31,770
scenario such as this one on the screen

338
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:36,240
with 40 people 18 team consumed reduced

339
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:40,940
up 1 gigabytes of them with 2 CPUs that

340
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,940
were virtualized CPUs from Amazon

341
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:49,940
basically it went very well performed

342
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:55,930
very well users did not complain at all

343
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,930
12 euros for 24 hours affordable

344
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:07,780
now examples of exercises exercises that

345
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:13,650
can be supported by this platform I will

346
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:17,260
be sharing three categories cryptography

347
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:21,400
exploiting web analysis three different

348
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:26,800
types of fixin areas and the most simple

349
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,300
example is statement headline you enter

350
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,909
the solution and that's it

351
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:35,080
any open source platform can do that for

352
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:38,980
you this is a cryptographic puzzle this

353
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:47,260
is the statement and then this is the

354
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:51,930
solution so you have a base64 chain to

355
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:55,960
code it and then you have fake has hex a

356
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:58,570
chain and then the secret message is

357
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,760
this one this is the flag then you

358
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:09,220
insert it here and that's it okay so

359
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:12,070
very no no mystery behind it now a more

360
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,350
complex exercise would be an exploding

361
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,120
challenge do you have a bite in binary

362
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,060
but you don't have to download it in

363
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,520
your computer and trust it no you don't

364
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,909
have to do that the platform gives you

365
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,670
an environment but in this case a

366
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:31,740
container you launch the container and

367
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:35,500
then you get on detail login details

368
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:39,030
some hast purged username password this

369
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:42,570
is an SSH chain

370
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:45,510
so you first configure the private and

371
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:48,300
public key and the actual platform gives

372
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:51,330
you the command that you need so you do

373
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,990
current paste and then you just go

374
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:59,879
through you log in through that SSH and

375
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:02,280
then tells you you have binary in - a PP

376
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,760
gives you the tools that you need to

377
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:09,690
debug the binary to do overflow whatever

378
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,660
you want to do so this one we will

379
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,730
resolve it later on in our demo this one

380
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,490
and the next one which are simple

381
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,920
success cases well have I applied this

382
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:24,750
platform and I give you the most recent

383
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:28,680
example I applied it in and events last

384
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,050
weekend in my louse hug in Lausanne

385
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,810
Switzerland

386
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:36,530
it was the Polytechnic University in

387
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:41,820
those an discipline 19 challenges

388
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:46,830
including 17 coyote challenges so I will

389
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:49,820
show you a few photographs 17 teams 40

390
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,820
participants

391
00:20:52,050 --> 00:21:03,960
the consumption of had resources to CPUs

392
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:08,400
and one gigabyte of RAM so invoice world

393
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:11,460
less than 15 euros 24 hours so that was

394
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:16,170
the objective and the user experience

395
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:18,870
was very flowing but I've seen in the

396
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:20,100
last five years in competitions is at

397
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,610
the end of the day in virtualized

398
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,060
environments as user experience is not

399
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:31,080
never too good because well everything

400
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:35,330
is no you are just I don't know do

401
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:39,000
typing in one language and then you then

402
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:42,870
you get like a serial Aiken language so

403
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,650
not a good user experience but not last

404
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:52,590
weekend so IOT so the problem with IOT

405
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:56,700
often you have your own never for each

406
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:59,929
device has of devices that you know what

407
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:04,050
you can see it ok top left is in

408
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:08,040
lightbulb then this is an IP camera on

409
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:13,820
the right we have radiofrequency so we

410
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,820
take a hack RF and then they had to

411
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:24,710
communicate or broadcast a walkie talkie

412
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:29,100
communication so there was an emphasis

413
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:32,040
NFC reader for control access presence

414
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:35,129
sensor and then we have this electronic

415
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,769
lock the temperature control temperature

416
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:41,850
sensor

417
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:45,700
driving fun and then the presence

418
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:47,949
detector activated an alarm this was a

419
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,830
result of doing that man-in-the-middle

420
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,220
attack will had a Wi-Fi network for all

421
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:58,809
these devices here at the bottom and

422
00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:01,840
basically these works through HTTP so do

423
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:04,690
you apply RP spoofing and then you

424
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,369
hijack the connections and you can do

425
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:10,119
whatever you want to do with the sensors

426
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:11,678
actuators so the objective of the

427
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:13,720
challenges were these months these were

428
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,090
basic challenges that were not advanced

429
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,779
challenges so there was quite a basic

430
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,129
training for students at this university

431
00:23:18,779 --> 00:23:23,889
there were not cybersecurity

432
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:27,580
professionals although I should say that

433
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:30,158
some professional jointing and then well

434
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,009
they did all that in two to three hours

435
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,289
and the students took 24 hours to

436
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:39,070
resolve the challenge in the case of the

437
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:42,730
camera was very simple API land mode

438
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:47,739
control just send commands and then IP

439
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:50,470
camera this vulnerable to a well-known

440
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:53,379
exploit rather than as Proteus impactor

441
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:56,350
do sent in a command or every quest HT

442
00:23:53,379 --> 00:24:02,019
to the best which is Parliament do

443
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:04,988
connect unit then get logging dot CTE

444
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:07,840
with no - intro intro and what you get

445
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:11,080
back part username equals this password

446
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,199
equals the password that you gave to it

447
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:19,199
and then you go into the cameras and

448
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:23,139
admin then you see the Wi-Fi password

449
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,389
and then taking advantage that there are

450
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:28,059
like some hundred thousand cameras

451
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:31,629
connected to the internet so you have

452
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:33,070
access to some 100,000 Wi-Fi all over

453
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:34,350
the world but but that's a different

454
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:38,610
topic

455
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:41,629
so these are oil tea challenges we gave

456
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,729
the students half an hour for each

457
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:48,090
device however that can be multiplexed

458
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,889
so if when a team was working on the lap

459
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,799
of and another one on the camera and

460
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:55,250
another team was working on the button

461
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,070
devices the button devices cannot be

462
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:02,220
multiplexed because they had to do a net

463
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,289
spoofing and you don't really want to

464
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,019
multiplex it because you cannot do it

465
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:09,600
okay you cannot work in parallel so what

466
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:11,519
is the what did you get what do we get

467
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,949
from the platform but it does a platform

468
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:18,029
deliver well it allows you to manage

469
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:20,519
shifts so let us say a team gets an

470
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:22,409
appointment from the 3 to 2:30 for this

471
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,850
challenge from 5:00 to 2:30 for this

472
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:25,950
other challenge from 6:00 to 2:00

473
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,689
success into this other challenge and

474
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,159
for this challenge you have to read this

475
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,620
document for this other challenge you

476
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:36,350
have to read these other documents well

477
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:38,549
which is good way to start so these

478
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,620
students resolving the challenge and the

479
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:44,590
winners and now

480
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:48,178
well let us see whether the platform but

481
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,178
soon we can see a live demo

482
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,090
okay that will be brief

483
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,819
[Music]

484
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:13,000
so there are two panels here a user

485
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,799
panel and admin panel and we are

486
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,250
primarily interested in the user panel I

487
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,830
am NOT ready logged in so there is a

488
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,139
profile itself where you run it for each

489
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:26,699
category where your team is where you

490
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:31,750
are in your team and then you may

491
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:34,029
download the VPN config file which is

492
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:37,240
the solution choose for VPN in this case

493
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:40,799
is not needed may be needed

494
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:45,159
yes you just log on to the public URL

495
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:48,549
for this web app you don't need VPN but

496
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:52,419
from here you may download the file then

497
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:55,418
you import the VPN piano pin and then

498
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:58,539
you may access challenges right away and

499
00:26:55,419 --> 00:27:01,179
this is the team public team well

500
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:04,539
actually there are a couple of keys and

501
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:07,330
then Jews I know the private key I don't

502
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:09,629
know whether you can see here bottom

503
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:18,780
left

504
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:21,960
it is very simple so this is the panel

505
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,260
for the challenges we started off with

506
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:29,570
the easiest one

507
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:33,240
well resolving this challenge was very

508
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:40,909
easy so this is a string at the same

509
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:40,910
place 64 for sure then you code it do

510
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:48,419
one did you put it into practice when

511
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,040
the students first is difficult to

512
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,220
resolve this one and the next one was

513
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,990
much easier well I thought it very

514
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,030
strange but the thing is that because

515
00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:00,060
they couldn't read I don't know that you

516
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:03,240
can read her not this is an exact XML

517
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:05,360
chain and while they found it very

518
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,440
strange and they did not continue

519
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,379
believe they were to read this is the

520
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,120
secret message and this is the exit

521
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,880
decimal chain if they had done that they

522
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,530
would have resulted very quickly so it

523
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,080
took them an average of an hour to

524
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:21,470
resolve the challenge which is quite a

525
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,470
strange

526
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:58,870
okay 25 points okay

527
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:03,159
[Music]

528
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:09,580
so this is the scoreboard that we used

529
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:13,420
last weekend so this is scoring this is

530
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:18,270
a horizontal line standing for a week we

531
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:23,050
see the well but each of the teams did

532
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:25,780
the progression and it's quite user

533
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:28,480
friendly platform and now when you need

534
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,970
a virtual environment let us go to the

535
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,260
first exploding which is easy to resolve

536
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:37,870
to click on it hook is very quickly it

537
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:41,650
gives you the environment you copy the

538
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:50,169
command or you just type it in while you

539
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:53,110
that you can copy it then gets locked in

540
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:58,290
I don't know how to enlarge the screen

541
00:29:53,110 --> 00:30:01,030
so that you can follow it so do you see

542
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:04,990
binary there there are many ways to

543
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:09,100
resolve it well gdb is one of them and

544
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:11,140
then it uploads in front and gdb

545
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,510
that is to say gives you the tools that

546
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,490
you need it also has radar and other

547
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,400
tools you don't really need to download

548
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:21,510
the binary or having anything installed

549
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,510
in your computer

550
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:32,000
so I'll show you how the binary works so

551
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,129
you run it and then it says okay give me

552
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,560
a password then you enter the passwords

553
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:39,680
and then it says no now that is not the

554
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:44,389
right password then we debug it very

555
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:48,110
quickly then we integrate it an argument

556
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:52,910
we see there Naugatuck the disassembling

557
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:55,550
we are doing step by step okay this is

558
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:58,330
basic thing to do in exploring well

559
00:30:55,550 --> 00:31:00,280
actually do you kind of consider this

560
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:05,980
exploding

561
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:08,980
then here right on top we see part of

562
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,980
password

563
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:30,179
okay we have the logs stuck and it is

564
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:35,370
comparing that to the all the contents

565
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:37,890
that have entered okay give me a sec

566
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:41,100
okay we should be getting it now here it

567
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:44,240
is this is the password okay password it

568
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,240
is just a random password

569
00:31:50,290 --> 00:32:01,690
okay and then give me the flag important

570
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:04,240
this is a dynamic flag if I pass it on

571
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:07,150
to different to another team it will not

572
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:13,110
work for them so flag is generated every

573
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:13,110
time and launch the launch and scenario

574
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:21,970
so this is good because it helps it

575
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:25,420
people not to cheat another an easy way

576
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:35,260
to resolve this challenge because this

577
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:38,470
is a string in the binary to do a great

578
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:42,580
flag or crack password and then you get

579
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:45,730
the password it is faster this was yes

580
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:48,490
an example for you to see how the

581
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:54,600
platform manages that you may buy a hint

582
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:57,190
and you use the string commands and well

583
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,469
you resolve the challenge very quickly

584
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:05,050
well there are other challenges that are

585
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:08,590
more complicated because this other

586
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:12,340
thing help to contain access to content

587
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:16,689
through SSH and it says connected easily

588
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:20,889
are L and I I know is STP and don't

589
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:25,480
answer it yes there's the container just

590
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:32,160
for you in this case you solve it it's a

591
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:32,160
felt the database table

592
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:46,918
and you have like it's easy to solve etc

593
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:50,158
it's a web panel dashboard

594
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,899
you push the button we have URL you

595
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,180
click and you have the environment to

596
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:58,379
solve it so it's trivial

597
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,380
[Music]

598
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:04,200
it works correctly because the

599
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,019
environment is only active if you're

600
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,000
solving it if you're not solving it the

601
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:13,349
environment is not as Human Resources

602
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,800
and once you solve it the platform

603
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:18,810
throws this away the user does not have

604
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,690
to do it and if it's open for more than

605
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:28,250
one hour it's also thrown away so it's

606
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:31,290
configured say that after one hour it's

607
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:38,510
thrown away so that does not consume

608
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:38,509
resources the administration panel

609
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:46,159
which is in Spanish here

610
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:49,870
you can see active environments in this

611
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,870
case there's no nothing

612
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:56,279
but you can more or less check what's

613
00:34:53,339 --> 00:35:00,599
consuming resources the flags that have

614
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:03,240
been captured when who in the team you

615
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,609
see the seductive environment here by

616
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,390
demo device

617
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:11,910
it shows the state you can access the

618
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:19,890
environment and you can check the logs

619
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:25,078
of that container the platform has an

620
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:28,799
event record the events that I think are

621
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,320
interesting have recorded it takes the

622
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,130
time to load because there's there are

623
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,369
recordings for 24 hours

624
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:42,109
basically demo device has logged in at

625
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:49,349
this time this challenge has been solved

626
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:53,390
the clue was bought the hint was bought

627
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:53,390
and there these are the types of events

628
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:08,810
we're bit behind schedule

629
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:11,540
I'm going to solve a couple other

630
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:13,580
challenges array you can see the spirits

631
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:16,390
of the competition for those of you who

632
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:16,390
are not familiar with it

633
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,519
this one is interesting

634
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,609
only one team solved it last weekend is

635
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:33,069
an exploiting event exploiting

636
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:36,339
environment but it doesn't give you the

637
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:37,960
binary code know whether sage it says he

638
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:40,569
have to connect through his socket

639
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,170
cities at the binary response how do you

640
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:43,170
face this

641
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:54,629
you connect gives you a user all up

642
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:58,620
give me a password Paulo it says no

643
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,620
incorrect credentials

644
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:16,310
I'm open text editor so you can see this

645
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,310
easily

646
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:47,100
with this little script we solve the

647
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:50,080
challenge so basically for exploiting

648
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:54,430
challenges this is a framework in

649
00:37:50,080 --> 00:38:00,930
Theismann which is quite useful upon

650
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:00,930
tools I strongly recommend it

651
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:08,359
as listen to there are two points you

652
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:14,440
send string format which is

653
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:18,920
vulnerability and basically I tried to

654
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:23,450
download the block of the process memory

655
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:25,430
which is what you're doing here the fly

656
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,259
is transmitted as an environment a

657
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:30,828
variable or the comparison is in the

658
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,359
memory the password against which you

659
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:34,670
are comparing to the memory it's going

660
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:37,720
to be shown in that piece of memory

661
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:41,599
you've downloaded so for each position I

662
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:44,629
connect I send the command I want and it

663
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,020
returns eight bytes memory which is

664
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,020
interesting

665
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:54,190
so I'd show the vulnerability here

666
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:10,070
the percentage P memory pointer first I

667
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,970
were going to give him give one which is

668
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,970
a first position

669
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:22,829
this is the first position is the memory

670
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:22,829
in hexadecimal so I do the same thing

671
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:41,079
and it gives me the next piece of memory

672
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:44,819
so to speak so I execute this solver in

673
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,819
the port given by the platform

674
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:55,710
it starts dump the memory until it finds

675
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,709
the flag

676
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,980
takes a while a few seconds

677
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:20,049
well step-by-step

678
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:20,049
there's not much left I think

679
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:29,510
and then you find the flag it finds the

680
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,510
flag so it's walked

681
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,930
simple challenges with very basic

682
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:37,930
notions

683
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,330
we've seen a series of environment there

684
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:55,000
are more this one for example

685
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:58,310
it was solved with just one Tim its

686
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,570
handbook buffer overload didn't have the

687
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,570
binary to do period

688
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:07,940
to debug it sorry

689
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:11,710
and no one tells you you have to go to

690
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:14,300
this direction within the binary code

691
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:19,400
SLR is activated perhaps is not that

692
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:24,230
easy this would be the solar in this

693
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:26,420
case with palm tools it's easy to do the

694
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,490
only difficult thing is finally the

695
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,760
offset it was a small buffer if you

696
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:34,549
iterated the opposite in which you

697
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,160
control the red in this case was 38 the

698
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:42,760
direction is given by the binary code

699
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,759
itself you code it as you should and

700
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:54,319
and then you get the flag in this case

701
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,319
we execute it to see how it is

702
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:11,970
I don't know if you can see it but this

703
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,970
is the flag quite simple

704
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,910
if you asked for a hint

705
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:28,120
his binary a function called scanf which

706
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:28,120
is vulnerable to overflow attacks

707
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,270
[Music]

708
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:37,609
another example because I haven't shown

709
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:40,670
any complex environment scenario a

710
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:42,440
comfort scenario a very and as example

711
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,119
boosie's one if you connect to a

712
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,619
container through as a sage the

713
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:50,539
environment says this I continue down

714
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:52,609
the network if you put DNS challenge

715
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:54,380
it's going to route to you there's a

716
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:57,470
token problem which is that you cannot

717
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:02,030
control I peers you cannot use fixed IP

718
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:03,259
so you need to use the internal DNS and

719
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:06,410
docker which is the name of the

720
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:09,230
container move less and it's routable so

721
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:11,569
the environment is called challenge it's

722
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:13,760
going to invert but you have no idea

723
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:15,500
what the IB is so every time you launch

724
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,020
it a different IB and it's very

725
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,730
complicated to use fixed IPS it doesn't

726
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,250
make sense in this case whether you work

727
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:26,180
within internal DNS and that's a that's

728
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:29,170
what the platform does it has

729
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,169
disadvantages too

730
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:44,410
in this case machine is responding right

731
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:46,450
this to see something and in this case

732
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:53,710
you connect to a server it says access

733
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:56,680
deny this is your token this was great

734
00:43:53,710 --> 00:44:01,300
idea if you realize there are with

735
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:02,799
numbers and consecutive numbers the name

736
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,800
is certainty cotton alternative and

737
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,980
Spanish it's authenticated based on your

738
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:15,570
so sport I can't remember the name of

739
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:15,570
the parameter I think it was this one

740
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:24,420
I can't remember the name

741
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:37,130
[Music]

742
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,130
local port

743
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,460
I can't remember

744
00:44:54,789 --> 00:45:06,900
this one if you send the HTTP request

745
00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:06,899
with a specific port which is 3 1 3 3 7

746
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,189
you realize that it was sent to getting

747
00:45:09,939 --> 00:45:14,848
against your local port you we were

748
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:18,009
given the flag and that's it

749
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:21,189
to measure that shot out of the box

750
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:24,779
thinking of candidates its platform

751
00:45:21,189 --> 00:45:29,319
beside training and education it's

752
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:31,749
designed also to hire staff I'm a

753
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:34,390
company I have a red team at pentester

754
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:38,229
testing team how do I know that

755
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:44,769
candidates or that are arriving have

756
00:45:38,229 --> 00:45:47,348
knowledge or not but they have the Exile

757
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:50,288
but they do it themselves that governed

758
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:53,140
the team of the company I need them to

759
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:55,989
know this to have the skills I can have

760
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:59,679
specific exercises with the specific

761
00:45:55,989 --> 00:46:02,229
topic and as a company as team leader

762
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,909
Canada I can assess their skills and

763
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:05,319
whether they they comply with the

764
00:46:03,909 --> 00:46:07,989
requirements I have for a specific

765
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:10,869
profile or perhaps it's more generic

766
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:13,209
move that I make profile what I want I

767
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:17,219
can measure this with it say can you

768
00:46:13,209 --> 00:46:17,219
please go back there to presentation

769
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,210
these are my conclusions

770
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:29,520
the cost visualization strategy is

771
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,380
pivotal more particularly for teaching

772
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,160
environments which was the main goal of

773
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:45,050
this project well it was that any

774
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:45,049
question what everyone that no questions

775
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,430
well that's it thank you very much

776
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:57,430
you
