I´m Maria, from Colombia. Public prosecutor. 

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,480
Coordinator of the comprehensive care center for victims of sexual abuse.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,680
As you will understand, many of our crimes today are committed online

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:24,520
and it is fundamental for us to be here, 
to participate and to acquire investigative tools

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,640
Get to know how it´s done, and to understand the dimensions of crime

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,460
But also know how it is researched in other places

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,620
where we have peer pairs, people doing the same thing

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,099
human beings serving human beings

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,560
in this area of knowledge, which is at the same time is so unknown for us

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,660
learn from technicians, learn from jurists

11
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,440
and get to know that the boundaries are just in our mind

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,640
Some minds, as ours, who work at service of the justice,
should be limitless.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,320
Thank you
