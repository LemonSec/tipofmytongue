1
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:11,606
New technologies have created possibilities unthinkable until now 

2
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:16,586
in the field of investigation of crimes and those responsible for them.

3
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:20,762
Maybe this is the time to formulate a new theory 

4
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:27,153
a general doctrine on the new
fundamental rights in this new digital environment.

5
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:31,454
Along this line, jurisprudence from the Criminal Chamber 
of the Spanish Supreme Court

6
00:00:31,546 --> 00:00:36,826
in the area of, for example, access to massive storage devices

7
00:00:36,918 --> 00:00:42,378
where fundamental rights such as the 
right to privacy and to the secrecy of communications,

8
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:46,198
or the fundamental right to the protection of personal data,
come into play  

9
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:49,342
has begun to consider a new, fundamental right, 
the right to have a private digital environment.
