1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,799
Well, really almost every attendee come form OAS countries

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,524
so we have a lot in common with them.

3
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,902
Mostly with Latin America countries we have a very good cooperation

4
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:23,643
engagement with the heads of cybercrime investigation units.

5
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:28,620
We try to harmonize our research methods, our procedures

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,465
as long as the different national regulations allows it.

7
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,894
But yes, I think we are all at quite the same level. 

8
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:37,568
Maybe, for a matter of time, because there are
units that have started a little later

9
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:40,708
then, well, they do not have the experience
and background that we can have

10
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,079
but in general yes, I think we are all at the same level.
