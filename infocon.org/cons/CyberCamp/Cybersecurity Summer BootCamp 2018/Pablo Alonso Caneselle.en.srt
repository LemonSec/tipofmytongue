Last year we already worked on this

2
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:12,719
on engagement with Policy Makers

3
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:17,416
as such, not as an aggregate part of the other groups.

4
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:25,862
It is a quite important cooperation
in order to see what their work procedures are

5
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:31,083
and in order for them to know what the investigation entails

6
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:34,664
what problems do we have when it comes to doing research

7
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:42,654
or submitting the information to be valid for their work.
