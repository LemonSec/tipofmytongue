1
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,380
This new edition is a fundamental achievement for us

2
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,480
as we welcome more than 300 participants

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,940
from 43 countries from the Americas, Africa, Europe and Asia.

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,100
This will allow our country, Spain, to strengthen its own cybersecurity

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,000
given that cybersecurity is a matter of international co-operation

6
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,720
The evolution of the Summer BootCamp 

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,900
has been like the evolution of cyber attacks: exponential. 

8
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,760
Since the first edition in which it had a very good reception

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,760
until this third edition that surpasses the 43 countries of multiple continents

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,480
I believe that there is no doubt that
this is one of the most important cybersecurity events in the world.

11
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,300
OEA and INCIBE have developed different initiatives 

12
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,860
which are reference points on an Ibero-American level, and on a world level

13
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,800
such as the International CyberEx, the Cybersecurity BootCamp

14
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,660
and the forum on gender and cybersecurity.

15
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,000
We are also involved in discussions to develop new initiatives 

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,820
which will allow the prevention and response capacity for cybersecurity incidents

17
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,960
in our member states to be strengthened.

18
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:13,920
In this way, we aim to offer better response tools to all the citizens of the Americas and Spain

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,160
in order to be able to counter emerging threats in cybersecurity.

20
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,940
We need to be ready, and to understand the latest techniques and advances in cybersecurity

21
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,840
and, at the same time, reinforce relationships and contacts with other countries.
