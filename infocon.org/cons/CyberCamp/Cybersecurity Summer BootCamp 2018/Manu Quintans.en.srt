00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,355
One of the major points that is created here is the networking

2
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:15,731
I have pupils from the last year that still writes me

3
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:17,655
and I keep the contact with them

4
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:25,352
To exchange opinions, share information about threats and
well, is very interesting in this respect.

5
00:00:25,352 --> 00:00:28,606
It is an initiative that in my opinion is a success.

6
00:00:28,606 --> 00:00:32,185
I have several years of international experience

7
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:36,550
and I believe that there is no other country
as far as I know, using this format. 

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:44,327
To make different countries, cultures
and different ways of working come together.

9
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:48,320
It´s almost two very intense weeks

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,867
in which there is much talk

11
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,897
a lot of collaboration and information exchanging

12
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:54,687
and I think it is something very positive.
