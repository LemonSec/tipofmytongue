1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:08,340
good afternoon thank you very much for

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:15,059
welcoming us we will try to explain

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:16,980
cybersquatting and consider a solution

4
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,900
we have to approach is ready and the

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,090
idea here is to convey a concept I'm

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,028
with technical and this is my colleague

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,369
even portilla the presentations in a

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,269
structure into the following bullet

9
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:34,559
points concept concepts ivory squatting

10
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:37,079
and Dominion so based on the information

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,110
that we have we'll see how we gather it

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,120
how we handle it and tools we have a

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,489
solution that you can have leg around

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,160
and another one that we have offline so

15
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,709
that you see how it can be detected the

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,019
same with swiss trick to Calais that you

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,300
probably know where you have open source

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,910
tools then we will also summarized as

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:02,069
well for those of you who are streaming

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:05,309
we have a telegram channel on telegram

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,010
got me laugh cybersquatting that's what

22
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,289
is open unfold Twitter users and you see

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,369
that own screen site hashtag

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,100
cybersquatting dot s this is the way for

25
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,330
you to ask questions or continue with

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,729
the project if you find it interesting

spinosum who is not here with us today

49

for the presentation but he's the one

50
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,870
that develops up to the beautiful

51
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,079
presentation and tools that it are

52
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,970
working is in thanks to here to him this

53
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,650

54
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:42,050
has been submitted as a dissertation and

55
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,210
he got the maximum school at the

56
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,620
University so it seems we are going down

57
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:50,180
the good way pathway brother so if

58
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,030
you've read the introduction you know

59
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,250
what this is all about so we give you

60
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:59,330
context and examples and regulatory

61
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,770
entities and I dms so with the

62
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,100
presentation what we wanted to show you

63
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,710
was that kind of type of squatting bit

64
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,780
squatting ID an autograph techniques

65
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,580
which might not bring a bell at all but

66
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,070
if I were to say that you use your phone

67
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,160
and sometimes with your finger or if

68
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:19,730
your screen is crushed you push the

69
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:23,900
keyboard and a different sign as pops up

70
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:26,540
in this s lucky you you've drawn you've

71
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,690
won the lottery install these so this

72
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,340
would be our approach approach to the

73
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:36,590
tools that are available in the solution

74
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:39,790
we put forward as I context so they

75
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:43,220
understand what it's available you see

76
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:47,299
294 million domains registered in 2015

77
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,870
large amount as they are off-the-shelf

78
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:54,680
solutions another 40 net dot as we've

79
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:57,250
focused on dot s in our department was

80
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,010
seen there is not a single solution to

81
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:06,290
find what could be domains that could be

82
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:09,140
squatted problem is 1,800,000 domains

83
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:13,400
that are registered so far is it serious

84
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:16,789
is it not well Facebook God compensation

85
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,200
over 2.8 million for a group of people

86
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,010
who were used in cyber squadron

87
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:25,820
techniques to get control of advertising

88
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,020
flows or gathering users they had to

89
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,759
return a hundred domain

90
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,659
and the company got the compensation

91
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:35,440
that was 2.8 million cyber squadron was

92
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:40,629
found it is a cyber squadron technique

93
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:44,210
quite quite straightforward wenn.com

94
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:46,759
started it was clear that people were

95
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,979
registering brands that were not their

96
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,009
own and then tried to Seoul sell them at

97
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:57,020
our heart cast we have good examples of

98
00:04:52,009 --> 00:05:01,880
that people register it as go all Google

99
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:04,159
maybe 30 or do miss and s a dot and that

100
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,349
leads you to a different website that

101
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:10,819
its advertising so it's using a digital

102
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:14,479
asset that does not belong to you in one

103
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:17,840
of the past's 411 man this is a block

104
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,110
there was an paper and article on Airbnb

105
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,789
pisser's or floods and with a dash in

106
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:28,370
between and there was this website

107
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:32,990
trying to hustle the user going in

108
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:35,509
through ideally style so you can go and

109
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,240
read the article on my blog this is a

110
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:41,659
reference as you can see this is a

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,919
platform but through different analysis

112
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:49,789
we found it with a Dasher with lower

113
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,340
dash l dot s com so we don't know

114
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:54,710
whether those names have belonged to the

115
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,359
brand itself and that's what we need to

116
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:01,159
find to make things easier to the

117
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,509
analyst or the person who is looking

118
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:08,360
into it whoever knits the solution then

119
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:12,469
so this is an example this is Hillary

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,960
Clinton but net a case that was sorted

121
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:18,139
out in May 2015 they bought over the

122
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,500
domain and they were referencing to your

123
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,909
image so to say and there are more cases

124
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,330
happened screen so it seems to be

125
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:32,889
current activity type of squatting as I

126
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,889
was saying this is a way through a typo

127
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:42,810
so mrs. fennan or at one instead of an

128
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:45,389
owl and you me you make the user be

129
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,560
mistaken and so they install any thread

130
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:56,040
in the computer mobile phone or scan

131
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:57,990
them as we've seen with Airbnb type post

132
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,949
squat in classification well if you

133
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:06,050
change our character this is already

134
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:10,350
type of squirting so adjacent character

135
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:12,870
search and replace or exchange then we

136
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,600
have bit squatting if you're with your

137
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:23,250
mobile phone and you don't have the

138
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:26,460
range you're out of range we're way

139
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,880
ahead of ourselves here so these all

140
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:33,479
it's been a year since one instead of

141
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,580
CNN it is calm so this is one of the

142
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,950
spherical operations that you say well

143
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,510
you cannot be seen it is negligible and

144
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:42,270
if one will explain how this kind of

145
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:45,810
mistakes might lead to governmental

146
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:48,539
Spanish actions or actions for activists

147
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,840
it's just an email box team books that

148
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:54,180
gathers all the emails and even if it's

149
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,440
a one out of 1,000,000 this data could

150
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,300
be private from the sea and I so this is

151
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,580
a practical example from YouTube you

152
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,700
might say someone mom go into onto

153
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,010
YouTube and they say hi to you boo and

154
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,110
if you go in here I wouldn't recommend

155
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,240
it they would say do you wanna download

156
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,120
the plug-in and the attachment for

157
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,880
Firefox it's not ideal but by using the

158
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,500
brand they use a YouTube logo and so

159
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,669
trying to force you into installing

160
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:26,760
whatever that is into your device of all

161
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:30,150
the uses that we have we have black CEO

162
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,279
SEO if it rings a bell drive redirect

163
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:35,760
you somewhere else you can have sales

164
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,279
there you can have fish in there you can

165
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,500
have combined to face of all kinds this

166
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:47,380
is all open to imagination to be honest

167
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:49,760
this is for sales one of these uses is

168
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,070
registering a domain whether it's my

169
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,970
brand or not doesn't matter with a typo

170
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,310
or I add an e a dash to the brand and

171
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:04,430
you see the market is a large and now

172
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:08,359
there is this domain 15 bits over 1.5

173
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,579
million so might not be cybersquatting

174
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,310
or type of squadron but someone got it

175
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:16,760
registered it and made it available for

176
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:19,160
someone and that is County calm and

177
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,939
there you see that people can be very

178
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,699
savvy and go for it he's regulating it

179
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,490
well it seems forest right why always

180
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:33,140
rather there are organizations such as I

181
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:39,040
can regulating the the address and

182
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:41,780
detailed is which is calmed a PEZ tlds

183
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,550
who is regulated in Spain that it's red

184
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,060
dot s I don't know if you know about it

185
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,359
but it's the public entity in Spain they

186
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,369
have domains on s and they control all

187
00:09:50,360 --> 00:10:00,140
the domains that have the dot X

188
00:09:52,370 --> 00:10:03,589
extension then we have internationalize

189
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,600
domains in Spanish with added enya in

190
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:08,120
Japanese you see a few characters that

191
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,400
who knows and might be among running

192
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,830
then German and then Chinese so we

193
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,230
thought that our own characters that are

194
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,240
coming to a given country some of those

195
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:21,530
characters might look like the spanish

196
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,390
ii or latin errata but they are not and

197
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,930
this is also used by attackers because

198
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:29,510
they know it by heart here you see how

199
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:33,829
the ones are used how those ones are

200
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:38,150
used and destinations hun is Chinese and

201
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:41,510
you say Latin is both you see region

202
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:43,939
country and the most widely used first

203
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:47,390
Latin than Chinese I really cetera so

204
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,820
any character any language where the

205
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,580
Chinese to really Cyrillic can register

206
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,950
names the same way we want to register

207
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:58,650
Spain or anything with an egg

208
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,420
in it but can be recorded and attackers

209
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:06,199
know about and they use it as a

210
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:12,569
potential threat idn Homer gravure

211
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:16,080
attacks toshiba so this looks like a tee

212
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:19,830
but it's actually not it is a Unicode

213
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,830
our 304 character that is the T Latin

214
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:26,040
constant that it's another unicode

215
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:28,830
character so often someone gets this on

216
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,469
what's up or whatever I opens it and it

217
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,480
links elsewhere so downloaded talking

218
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,000
for documentation from here so it's mel

219
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,150
whatever and it's used for social

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,040
engineering attacks the user cannot

221
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:45,240
distinguish it or tell it apart and it

222
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:51,660
works then unicode spoofing is Chinese

223
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:54,780
in Brighton and on unicode I we get

224
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,370
citibank.com you can use it and produce

225
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:00,270
it in Chinese but what you get in return

226
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:06,900
is a domain that to the user it might

227
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:10,350
seem legit another example here you see

228
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:13,880
Google and Google Greek and Latin but on

229
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:16,290
the right side you see the characters

230
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,680
characters and you see there are

231
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,329
differences there I don't explain it

232
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,030
because you see it invite and it seems

233
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:26,370
to be the same I do the naked eye but it

234
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:32,250
is not Vodafone first one Incirlik it's

235
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:34,830
a bit different to our latin v and now

236
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:39,300
let's move on to spain's different so

237
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:42,080
we've got nu that's and with a strike on

238
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,310
top but this is a universe with

239
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,260
thousands and millions of domain son

240
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,459
would be difficult to detect it also we

241
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:52,800
wanted to focus our work on dot s we

242
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,260
have a manual data extraction then we

243
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,540
saw there were better ways to do it we

244
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:04,770
had hush 43 and others like this part

245
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:07,500
manually so who is 43 sorry and risk and

246
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,720
you could use it for other purposes we

247
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,370
decided to go with the good one

248
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,430
you see this is the main side and you

249
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,889
can see there is a browser to see ya or

250
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,349
an end insurgency if it's raised it or

251
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:21,540
not that's a who is and then the number

252
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:25,019
of total domains that it's over 1.8

253
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,759
million what's funny Hume as it

254
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:30,750
intelligence analysis where do I get my

255
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:34,350
data there is this statistics which will

256
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:37,829
be pretty useful for the statistics you

257
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:40,350
see from 2007 2 2016 all the domains

258
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:42,628
registered every month you get location

259
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,790
where they are and everything else you

260
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:47,040
see a number of subscriptions and

261
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,889
there's one from November we try to give

262
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,089
it updated as much as possible and we

263
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:55,920
will show it to you so here with the

264
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:58,290
statistics with thee that this is all

265
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,729
made up of PDF files we download to the

266
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:05,490
files so that are 600 pages long and

267
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:07,560
what i do with that i download all the

268
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:10,110
files with v get which you know it and

269
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,560
that it's a manager otherwise we're

270
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:17,459
right click and you have it and we got v

271
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,979
good and we've list w get rather and we

272
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,018
have all the domains you know that pass

273
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,050
did you use different libraries this one

274
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,750
is on github and if you want if you're

275
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:29,878
interested to you do it faster there is

276
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,309
an online dinner you can upload the PDF

277
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,550
file and you get the text back for all

278
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:37,649
the domains you need to use some regular

279
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,079
expressions and remove a few items could

280
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:43,050
be but for larger but it's not advisable

281
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,329
some other tools such as PDF box by

282
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,910
apache these are open source solutions

283
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:50,758
that we've downloaded we finalize them

284
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,589
and in a line we've gotten all the

285
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,809
subscriptions and have been transferred

286
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:58,470
to a text file that we will handle later

287
00:14:54,809 --> 00:15:02,910
on who is 43 stephen easton and even

288
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:06,480
takes a flow now Victor he's from Poland

289
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,129
and so he summarized all the information

290
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,509
and gather differ making the most

291
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:14,670
difficult way with who is 43 well this

292
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:18,420
is a service that offers offered by

293
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:21,420
retro s where with a single request you

294
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,819
just sign in and sign up

295
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,310
and you will have access to what they

296
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,980
call you is 43 which is kind of a tool

297
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:32,579
to gather information on a specific

298
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,830
domain port 43 is left open for the

299
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:39,800
communication and to get the data that

300
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:43,200
they want for that we can have you are

301
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:46,140
URL of the future visual web site that

302
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,940
it's on the screen and you need some

303
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:53,130
kind of digital certificate otherwise

304
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:56,880
doesn't work once the request is

305
00:15:53,130 --> 00:16:02,480
received you've sorry the form do you

306
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:05,520
fill it in and then you decide the IP

307
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,460
where the requests will be covered and

308
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,790
that's where we have different who s

309
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:18,390
options for a given domain then problem

310
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:20,520
is there are only 10 records per minute

311
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:23,310
so there's a limitation they are here

312
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:29,699
you can see on the screen when find the

313
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:36,540
cursor first one on who is done it that

314
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:38,520
s the one listening in and that's where

315
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:42,000
you got the piece of data for intimate

316
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:44,130
as same down there but for cyber camp as

317
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,780
you get the response a specific result

318
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:51,420
for the domain name the entry spot and

319
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:57,959
the name of the one Reggie stream it and

320
00:16:51,420 --> 00:17:00,300
the last update then as I said there was

321
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,850
a some limitation to the previous mouth

322
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,480
but with risp we can download the whole

323
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:11,089
database and play around with it same

324
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:15,599
here same URL URL and we need digital

325
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:17,550
certificates you fill in the form do you

326
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,780
mention that you are gonna run some

327
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:23,899
tests together f stats and and you go

328
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,899
ahead

329
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,430
one year on the portal and once the

330
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:35,150
request has been granted and accepted we

331
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:38,960
will get a fine that is csv only

332
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,910
available for five days after five days

333
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,380
it will be disabled and no access

334
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:48,500
granted the database itself has around a

335
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:55,610
million point eight domain 1.8 million

336
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:58,220
domains in total so once we've got all

337
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:01,490
the domains what are we interested in in

338
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,010
order to relate them and see if they're

339
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,380
on the did or who they belong to often

340
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:09,680
if you're going to buy it helps you to

341
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,080
see if it belongs to the company that it

342
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,080
says is selling the product because

343
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,179
sometimes you get saves from different

344
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,010
domain on the domain page you have to he

345
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,740
is with all the data because the fans

346
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:25,190
that if one's showed the information is

347
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,290
a bit narrow and you've got the ID tags

348
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,560
and the name of the organization here

349
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:34,850
you can check name technical contact so

350
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:37,340
DNS servers but for each attempt there

351
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:40,879
is a catch up another way to get

352
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:44,959
information would be through nslookup

353
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,910
command there you we get IP email

354
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,030
servers to see if someone's got our

355
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:52,340
server and need self spoof innate or

356
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:54,800
domain names if there is a legit

357
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,780
organization if we spot I domain we can

358
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,030
see if it really belongs to the

359
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:03,310
organization audit spins poofed if it's

360
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:05,690
within the legit organization with some

361
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:10,639
room for error we can guarantee that

362
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:13,400
there is that idiot legit tools that

363
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,350
we've played around with we have them

364
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,670
that are open source the first one is

365
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:24,429
DNS twist asad it's open source and it

366
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:24,430
was created by Martin from Poland

367
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:32,290
somehow well it is all about looking

368
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,290
into potential threats happening

369
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,990
having to do with type escorting and

370
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:41,199
also spoofing the mime spoofing here you

371
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:44,830
see the repository when it is located

372
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,010
with some get hat and main features is

373
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:51,550
that it has a large range of algorithms

374
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:56,400
that are varied and that will allow you

375
00:19:51,550 --> 00:20:00,330
to get a large amount of typographic

376
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,790
variations type variations i have this

377
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:06,070
acquaintance who is quite quiet and

378
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:09,340
phage he spent a lot of hours in the gym

379
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,679
and he's got very large fingers and and

380
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,600
thick fingers and some many typos when

381
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,290
he tries to tie because he cannot press

382
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:22,179
the button he would mind and same as an

383
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:26,889
nam name resolution i beep ipv4 six and

384
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:29,290
then comparison comparing these specific

385
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:34,840
website that is the starting point it

386
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:38,950
compares it against variety of typos

387
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:42,870
found or the type of class rather and it

388
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:47,490
using these different elements to detect

389
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:55,110
potential vision that might be happening

390
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:59,850
then host team X checking as Victor said

391
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:05,909
where you can intercept the email

392
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:09,580
messages when it comes to espionage then

393
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:13,360
this is just typical and this is a

394
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,220
screenshot for the tool itself here you

395
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,310
see all the functions all the parameters

396
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,200
that were available to get a larger

397
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:24,610
amount of information out of fit and

398
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:29,000
this comes from google so next here you

399
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:30,678
see a clip sleiman how

400
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,600
[Music]

401
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:43,049
everything need to take sand first we

402
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:45,600
see drain brand used by Google and just

403
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:49,889
the rest would be different columns with

404
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,678
the type of class is used and as Victor

405
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:55,409
explain different main combinations and

406
00:21:52,679 --> 00:22:00,390
gets this information for each IP

407
00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:03,690
forties DNA XD and X options HTTP

408
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:07,470
banners are not long list which is very

409
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:12,510
useful when trying to look into every

410
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:16,440
single case and it the only thing it

411
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:19,559
does not detect between register domains

412
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,919
but actually what it does is compare

413
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:26,070
them all even if they are not registered

414
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,419
next we have you are L crazy quite

415
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:32,039
similar to the previous one that has

416
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:34,799
been developed by Andrew Horton from

417
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,860
Australia and same purpose here

418
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,408
detecting type was caught in your L

419
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:48,539
hijacking and fishing it that's what it

420
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:50,940
is does a website and the connector is

421
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:54,720
akia is that you can have a study on the

422
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:58,409
most common errors on a given domain for

423
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,350
a given brand to understand how the

424
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:04,770
variation can impact on the brown itself

425
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:10,860
so there is quite a good protection of

426
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:15,720
the carpet brand next this is another

427
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:18,029
screenshot for this tool your url tracer

428
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,460
this has been included in cali no need

429
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:22,789
to do anything else and it's also

430
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:29,309
available for some linux distributions

431
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:32,940
this this time around it was google you

432
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:34,500
type your el crazy simple as that and

433
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,750
it's analyze don't worry it's quite

434
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,580
similar to the previous one it detects

435
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,990
the type of technique that has been

436
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:54,678
followed variations in domains IPS and x

437
00:23:42,990 --> 00:24:00,150
I guess no geolocation and an ass get

438
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:03,750
platform we've developed takes these two

439
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:07,260
tools as a basis and it moves them

440
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:09,420
forward trying to detect all those cases

441
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,300
of spoofing or fishing we mentioned so

442
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:15,240
in a simpler way in a more visual way to

443
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:20,070
try to deal with it the architecture

444
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,870
itself that we've reduced would be using

445
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:27,330
two different databases one of which is

446
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:32,729
based basically on this is a relational

447
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:34,889
one is based on dot s databases and then

448
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,770
MongoDB all the results that are

449
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:41,010
produced on so the reports are stored

450
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:45,270
their framework is down low you probably

451
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:47,070
know it and helps you integrate

452
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:51,389
different programming languages such as

453
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:57,330
Ruby or Python there are different

454
00:24:51,390 --> 00:25:00,360
technologies and here you have it this

455
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:04,620
is the video for the tool we first

456
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:10,709
analyzed in zipper with all tilly tlds

457
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:15,270
comm Network info and s it takes 19

458
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:21,780
minutes to detect it and 54 title

459
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:26,610
records 94 IDM in a total of 915 I know

460
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:30,610
this is such small print here you see

461
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,070
the percentage for each record

462
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,050
[Music]

463
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:37,840
this is cybersquatting and you see all

464
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:42,610
the results for all the data that's been

465
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,250
gathered same us with your L crazy here

466
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,649
you see another function kicking in that

467
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:53,950
is an in old information regarding

468
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:57,640
domains so who is an everything else geo

469
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:59,560
location of the specific IP address

470
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,080
where it is located and when I rush

471
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,320
through it and then a few more links to

472
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,210
checked virustotal Ripper and others

473
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:14,020
there is a clean shot for the website

474
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:16,420
itself that you can that can help you

475
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:21,100
later on analyze whether there is a scam

476
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:24,640
a domain scam or not and you see that

477
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:27,520
there are many non active and well the

478
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,710
it analyzes both active and inactive and

479
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,740
it can perceive in diapers and type

480
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,390
variations not just to cover only a few

481
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,220
of those that are registered but covet

482
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,500
also those that are not registered this

483
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,680
this is ID and we also look into it and

484
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:47,350
it gives you information on that given

485
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:56,740
idn demain each of them actually x-ray

486
00:26:47,350 --> 00:27:02,129
info then second analysis just like

487
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:07,180
combined in cyber camp and dot s by

488
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:10,330
screenshots and geo locations and it

489
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:14,200
looks into it and you see six minutes of

490
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:19,620
analysis and it's found six records if I

491
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:22,990
actually read it right and one score now

492
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:26,679
but again it gets information regarding

493
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:30,010
to the main location here it is just

494
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:35,220
about combining potential threats to

495
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:38,220
cyber camp that s both race turd or

496
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,220
inactive

497
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:51,120
now you've seen the way we've worked

498
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,820
with these tools how we've tried to make

499
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,979
things easier the source of it all in

500
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,530
order to have it done on dot s you've

501
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,670
seen there are cut chips and getting

502
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,309
information is a bit more complicated

503
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:06,390
you might need to get it out of a PDF

504
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:09,660
and as event set for risk if you have

505
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:16,500
the file what we do is list it all and

506
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:19,320
grab it we grabbed it with KS and what

507
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,540
they've done is take care of typos this

508
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,000
one-way street for passion and another

509
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,129
one for other mixes or combinations

510
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,059
they've conducted a study as you might

511
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:33,059
know and they've tried to cover it oh

512
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:36,120
this is how it's done manually before

513
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:37,770
its automated we get data from risk and

514
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,590
this I'll be the mains that are

515
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:45,090
registered the entity name on the tax

516
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:47,879
nom nom all I deem and once we have the

517
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:51,330
tax ID that's the search we pulled the

518
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,370
threat as with an investigation I have a

519
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,780
starting point that's the name and keep

520
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:57,360
looking and see if there are other names

521
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:00,690
that are left outside and so what

522
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,389
they've done dumpsters I'm sorry we've

523
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:06,870
done down there and we grab it and come

524
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:10,500
lines and it's up over 300 combinations

525
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,939
at least with at least that's what we

526
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,880
thought and compared to other companies

527
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:19,670
this is actually quite an an effort to

528
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,670
get this dot s domain narrowed down

529
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,420
levenshtein distance well if I grab it

530
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:30,360
I've my finish or not will I find out

531
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:33,420
the solutions well this way we can be

532
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,510
fast track in looking for solutions and

533
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,520
we can have this algorithm that says

534
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:41,820
from Casa to Connor that's the Spanish

535
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:45,480
these are quite similar or color and

536
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:48,090
Calle in spanish so if you've called the

537
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,400
whole risk database if you go through

538
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:53,280
the whole file this will be a first

539
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,570
approach to the problem and that's what

540
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,300
would

541
00:29:53,570 --> 00:30:01,810
done so far and with Kaiser you seen

542
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:04,730
with God Levenstein what 0 1 2 3

543
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:06,350
characters distance long distance house

544
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:11,200
is the same so hundred percent

545
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:11,199
similarity so we found the same but then

546
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:19,639
Liza 12 caixa so want equation well for

547
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,000
an analyst out of 1.8 million it would

548
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,980
take them a bit longer but this can be

549
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,650
done fast track and it uplifts later

550
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:31,700
data so to find out what's good what's

551
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:36,800
evil and etc you see rapes as well that

552
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:39,910
way you can get an idea of www TS and

553
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:43,550
dot is quite a technique use for

554
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:47,330
mistaken the field making the user field

555
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:50,030
mistaken so we have this portal that

556
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:53,169
we've released and i'll show it to you

557
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:58,760
now so that you can test it and you have

558
00:30:53,170 --> 00:31:00,530
automated it all to have access it's a

559
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,410
squatting dot s and as we were saying

560
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:06,500
for twitter and telegram you have fit

561
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:09,350
there in case of questions you can ask

562
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:14,920
us anything you want and other

563
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,919
approaches so even can you open it up

564
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:23,360
Molly aki lo tenemos los hace mas como

565
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:30,320
in fear so if we search for in see where

566
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:34,959
we can find it yeah or devolo the

567
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,960
hamodia niblet so it is available now so

568
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:42,230
perfect thank you thank you very much

569
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:50,290
for the setting so Titans event please

570
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:50,290
and set distance 22

571
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:56,060
rate percentage fifty percent if

572
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,130
possible and here you can see one of the

573
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:02,360
solutions the other one that even showed

574
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:05,930
you is a bit offline now but this one we

575
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,490
wanted to we want you to make it open to

576
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,500
you so that you can use it if you feel

577
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:11,180
curious about it a difficult to explain

578
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:16,850
how you can do it how you can handle

579
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:19,580
information information of everything

580
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:25,030
that it is widget because I can see

581
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:25,030
someone turning me downloading the file

582
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:31,520
so what to do things that are not that

583
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:35,330
evidence so therefore what we did was

584
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,580
just to take it out to use it for good

585
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:41,300
to give a good juice to it we that

586
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:45,230
information we enrich it we gather IP

587
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:50,149
address to find out whether the game is

588
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:53,470
the game that we are registering that we

589
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:56,290
are pretty simple that it belongs to the

590
00:32:53,470 --> 00:33:04,300
organization and we will see results

591
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:10,399
filtered so you will you can match the

592
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:13,100
such a turn with the heat so this is a

593
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,670
metal version so if there is any ever

594
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:19,010
any mistake please let us know so please

595
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:24,590
mention that or let us know through the

596
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:28,070
telegram channel or on Twitter so please

597
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:32,560
spot mistakes or errors and please let

598
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,560
us know and here you see

599
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:44,169
you can test it if you want because it

600
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:49,478
is available is CBS sup address IP so

601
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:51,729
these are in rich data so when it comes

602
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:54,879
to doing research it is good to have dns

603
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:57,429
servers IPS to see what are they domain

604
00:33:54,879 --> 00:34:01,330
yet by an IP and at the end the future

605
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:07,570
is that from an IP together to settle

606
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:11,259
the domains or the main servers so here

607
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:13,270
down below we see well to get

608
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:16,089
information from but these are the

609
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:20,409
typical sources that will do Paris total

610
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:24,759
domaintools certain finds out about the

611
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:28,899
IP or country where it is and the same

612
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:36,010
the same for abuses when we use miss

613
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:39,279
juices so geolocation in this case this

614
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:41,770
tells you whew well that you gives you

615
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:45,309
the coordinate these are data from drip

616
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:47,918
or from other open sources we trusted we

617
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:50,139
trust them if there is any data which is

618
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,210
not accurate we try to cover it in terms

619
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,609
of screenshots it is good to have it as

620
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,880
an evidence and as historic data we have

621
00:34:54,609 --> 00:35:02,430
not implemented it's in this version not

622
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:08,349
yet because we'll stories and make it a

623
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:10,210
historic it is difficult so we for

624
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:13,510
whatever reason we didn't have perhaps

625
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:16,480
the space we did it internally but we

626
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:19,480
did not publish it so any suggestions

627
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,369
for any other functionalities are always

628
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:32,710
welcome now we move on to the

629
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:36,250
presentation alright so next steps now

630
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:38,410
it's always but these needs optimization

631
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:43,089
this is just a version hopefully you

632
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:45,759
find it helpful for optimized dipoles

633
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:49,470
you can also play around with it you

634
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:54,070
know that some domains at the chapel w

635
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:59,200
some of them are very curious and then

636
00:35:54,070 --> 00:36:03,970
another functionality alerts on email if

637
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,859
every time it detects a matching a

638
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,368
coincidence it would be good for you to

639
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:11,380
receive another than your email then

640
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:14,170
beat squadron module you need to

641
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:17,520
transfer to switch all the characters to

642
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:21,220
a beach and then to see what is the

643
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,690
difference so this is easy to do it but

644
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,180
we just didn't do it because we didn't

645
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:31,030
have the time research modules it's

646
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:33,520
about locating reverse IP MX + s so this

647
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:36,849
is good because sometimes for instance

648
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,040
if you are aware of a malicious IP do

649
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:42,609
you want to find out about other domains

650
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,890
that are associated with it if we had it

651
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:47,680
in our database we could really we could

652
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:50,348
tell you what are the domains that were

653
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,169
related to that IP address or to those

654
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:57,040
MX if you look it up on Google do don't

655
