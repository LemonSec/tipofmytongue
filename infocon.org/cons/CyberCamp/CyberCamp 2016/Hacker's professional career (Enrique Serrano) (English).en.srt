2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:17,880

challenged him now I will tell you how

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,779
you can make a living out of it here

and how this kind of entertainment

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:00,510
Alicia could end up being a way of life

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,379
it is not a question of well is the same

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,259
as video gamers who became youtubers

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,330
they are living on making a living out

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,650
of the thing that they feel passion for

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,860
and this is my case so this is my

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,270
website my treats address just in case

23
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,259
you want to contact me I will be

24
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,298
delighted ok this is these that i

25
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:34,409
started programming when i was 13 years

26
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:38,790
of age i am 25 now when I started this

27
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:41,100
is as much as we had so 13 years ago I

28
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,680
had a black and white mobile phone and a

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,439
gameboy so nowaday my cousin's my

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,509
niece's have an iphone and they are not

31
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,089
even sixteen years of age we can also

32
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,570
take advantage of that i started when i

33
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:58,799
was 13 because i was given a computer as

34
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:05,359
a gift to use the messenger but now we

35
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,360
have many many young people in the past

36
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,500
even if you had a junk talents you

37
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,869
couldn't do anything with them do just

38
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,790
needed them to wait them for them to

39
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,800
grow up but now it is not the case

40
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,340
anymore we can do many things with young

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,580
people so one year later I was talking

42
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,280
with my friends through messengers and I

43
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,590
just to say well if I'm talking to my

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,110
friends through messenger why Cannot

45
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,790
like go beyond that it's not that I

46
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,310
always wanted to make a difference but I

47
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,700
always wanted to do more to me messenger

48
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,650
was falling short and I said well if I'm

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:45,540
connected with my friend why shouldn't i

50
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:47,550
sent him image and communicate with them

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,950
and this is what I started to do I

52
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,340
started to do different things and I

53
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,470
said okay well timed out this game and

54
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:58,680
then I was switching them through on the

55
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:03,230
web camera that's the way of starting

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:06,540
and other than computer science I

57
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:10,109
started while he will have to talk about

58
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:14,570
magic I was a student at temerity a

59
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:17,870
magic school and at that time and

60
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:21,299
computer science at that time was just

61
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,780
let us say it resided in a Game Boy so

62
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,880
for many years I was doing magic when

63
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,070
non doing I'm not doing as much magic

64
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,519
because in that you have to find your

65
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:37,560
priorities and this is an example of

66
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:41,519
what I told you before who here is aware

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:45,630
of this trillion sub seven this was one

68
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,510
of the trillions that started to reduce

69
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,120
to go beyond to take a step further

70
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,450
these are all the functionalities of the

71
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,580
trillions well there d able to see a

72
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:59,850
person life to have full access to the

73
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,350
heart risk and what happens those of you

74
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,570
who raised your hand do you know what

75
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,489
happens if you log on to any website to

76
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,320
the notice try and piece was the next

77
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:11,489
thing back to cause at the end of the

78
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,019
day you were yourself and that's

79
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,959
why my mom was ooh

80
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,910
I had to buy several computers then I

81
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,390
have to learn how to restart my computer

82
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:25,420
i went to nynex because you know that

83
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,500
when you end up in this world or just

84
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,180
starting this word joints that are

85
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,110
hugging yourself because there are many

86
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:34,060
online Trump's and then when I was 16 17

87
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,710
years of age I wanted to take a step

88
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,270
further because everything that I did

89
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,700
was just a copy and paste from the

90
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,060
internet and I said well it is enough i

91
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,190
would try to learn to do to do something

92
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,480
myself and that's when I started to

93
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:51,370
google the web to visit fora and because

94
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,350
of the center work lots of content well

95
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,420
now there is much more content out there

96
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,190
that i read such as this one there are

97
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,160
chats and communities hacking

98
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,860
communities not only when mundo haka

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,910
that I would be mentioning before that i

100
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:09,340
will mention later on so apparently

101
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,110
there are six or seven communities now

102
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,469
there are very many different ways to

103
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,090
learn nowadays if we if you don't want

104
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,790
to learn that it's just because you

105
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,679
don't want to this is mundo haka and I

106
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,250

00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:58,479
visto so we started back in 26 seats we

125
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,880
are 10 years old now well we started

126
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,949
being a group of freaks we used to meet

127
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,949
up on fridays afternoon to do research

128
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:08,470
we started in the beginning there were

129
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,210
five of us and each of us prepared a

130
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,790
presentation pressing a meaningful

131
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,580
presentation it is not like oh I so

132
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,410
decent are on google not do we had to

133
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,479
prepare presentation to share it with

134
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,310
the others and also to give some

135
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,409
materials for the other members of the

136
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,810
team to try at home over the weekend I'm

137
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,340
not going to tell you what we gave the

138
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,520
other members of the team to try at home

139
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:33,099
and then one sometimes we ended up we

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,349
ended up being a big big group we ended

141
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,110
up being sometimes 20 people so the idea

142
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:41,680
was to contribute so if you want to make

143
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,240
it you have to prepare a presentation we

144
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,070
will be here for three hours and then if

145
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,949
you contribute to the community you're

146
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,750
going to stay in the community and also

147
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:53,350
to share knowledge to transfer knowledge

148
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:56,919
we had the radio show the TV show we

149
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,750
wrote some books as well and we did it

150
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,150
because we liked it in the end we just

151
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,610
didn't want to be on TV we just didn't

152
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:07,270
want to give presentations of this kind

153
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:11,260
so we everyone was at the Disco a

154
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:17,710
nightclub a 15 years of age and I just

155
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:20,440
wanted to be a haka and then they called

156
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,080
us from the radio than the co class from

157
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,020
the TV and then they give us a shell and

158
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:31,240
now thinking about the labor world and

159
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:33,669
the future what says here on top this is

160
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:38,890
the mr. rubble serious I'm sure that

161
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:41,708
many of you have watched it and many

162
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,779
people say well no doesn't really matter

163
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,489
the way how do you look like your

164
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:47,950
appearance is not important people

165
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,610
should love me for what I am but not

166
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,070
where I am kind of half of agree so here

167
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,730
we see different ages on the screen this

168
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,400
person wearing shirts and I'm mentioning

169
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:04,040
the

170
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:06,050
with regards to the labor work well of

171
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,660
course appearance is not important

172
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,660
because the value is in size but the

173
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,940
first impression is very important it is

174
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,730
good to have knowledge inside but you

175
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,260
really need to know how to sell yourself

176
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,510
and you really need to have a good

177
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,400
experience appearance and people may

178
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:29,930
gonna say yeah what matters is what is

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:32,689
inside yes I know but this is a tip tip

180
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:37,640
that I give you do not neglect neglect

181
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:40,370
your appearance in terms of making a

182
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,699
living out of it I have decided to use

183
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:47,180
these photographed Michael Jordan and I

184
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:52,040
am also a basketball coach and he said I

185
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:58,910
failed 9,000 throws in my career I lost

186
00:09:52,040 --> 00:10:01,849
300 games 26 times d I miss thing a

187
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:05,000
thrill and we lost the game he said I

188
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,880
fail over and over again in my life and

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,190
that's what have brought me success it

190
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:18,860
is good to have a motivation to be

191
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:23,720
consistent to persevere but you also

192
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:26,390
have to be sensible you have to set out

193
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,950
yourself objectives a typical questions

194
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,750
you are asked when you go to a job

195
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,180
interview what do you expect to become

196
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,470
but you want to be in ten years time how

197
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:37,310
do you picture yourself in ten years

198
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:40,580
time do not think about ten years time

199
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:42,829
perhaps it is too far away in time but

200
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:45,830
think about five years time but it is

201
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:48,050
good to say to stop and to set our

202
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:51,620
objectives this is not a mistake this

203
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:54,740
photograph is not a mistake but it says

204
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:58,010
it's not mistake okay so sometimes in

205
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,100
life everyone wants to be Michael Jordan

206
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:02,780
all of them there are very good but

207
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,590
Michael Jordan is the one that will

208
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:10,670
stand out many times I've recommended

209
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,620
you be one of those wearing these suits

210
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,110
ensure

211
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,150
we will not remember this man after

212
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:20,080
depres entation but i would pay for be

213
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:22,449
one of those men wearing suit there so

214
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,540
these are people who have been there who

215
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,970
have been learning there are moments at

216
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,279
times in life where you cannot be

217
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,570
Michael Jordan but you are just around

218
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:37,390
so wanted to grow very fast is not that

219
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,430
good you really need to learn as lonely

220
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:42,910
you really need to take your time this

221
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:45,849
is light it CTFs when i used to do CTFs

222
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:48,640
if you do not make it your own it is not

223
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:50,500
good I know there is a backdoor juju in

224
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,439
a way but you really need to learn how

225
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,210
to do it I knew that I could do it but I

226
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:01,540
did not land it I do not learn it truly

227
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:03,910
so you have to look for the bottom of

228
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,410
things it is not a question of knowing a

229
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,140
bit about everything you really need to

230
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:13,540
have a deep well settled knowledge and

231
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:15,819
now difficult decisions well this is an

232
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:20,319
anecdote that I want to share with you

233
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:23,260
it is I prefer to be the head of mouse

234
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,260
than the tail of a lion and I give you

235
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:30,370
the example of course for instance you

236
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:33,490
can buy low rank a car and then to add

237
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:36,370
extra feature would you come by a higher

238
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,080
rank car with no extra features what

239
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,250
happens at the end of the day you have a

240
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:45,130
big world but when you interact with

241
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,200
people were driving fast cars also that

242
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:51,910
we notice that your car doesn't have any

243
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,220
features and then when you buy a no rank

244
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,380
car and then you are all the extra

245
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,440
features by the time you will meet with

246
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,529
other drivers with no grunts no rank

247
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,570
cars you will succeed and then what I'm

248
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,089
saying this because in life we all have

249
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,760
to make decisions i joined the labor

250
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,350
world only four years ago but when it

251
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:19,569
comes to decide what you want to become

252
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:21,940
those of us who are IT engineers we all

253
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,990
want to be slightly different different

254
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,080
and special and as

255
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,880
support that I support that I strongly

256
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,750
believe in that let us make a difference

257
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,250
do you want to make a difference well

258
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,459
you want to be alive but at the end of

259
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,470
the day you end up being a mouse so take

260
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,420
to make your own interpretation out of

261
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,910
it but at the end of the day if you want

262
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,500
to be very good at something and you

263
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,600
will notice that as you learn new things

264
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,180
for instance if you want to know a lot

265
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,640
about cars then you go and say okay

266
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,930
today I know nothing about cars I don't

267
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,779
mind going into the world without

268
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:59,870
knowing anything now at the end I you

269
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:02,959
know a lot and then you want to be alive

270
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,690
but you realize that the more you know

271
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,560
the more you learn the more you realize

272
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,510
that you don't know so the same goes for

273
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,599
hockey as i'm going to specialize myself

274
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:18,589
in attacks SSF then when you master that

275
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,560
Debbie said another knowledge waiting

276
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,570
for you so in the beginning learn from

277
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,699
the others learn from the others when

278
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,500
you join a company you will be the last

279
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,480
ones you will be the new ones that there

280
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,610
would come a time that you will be in

281
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,079
the position to transfer knowledge to

282
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,850
the others so it's not only a question

283
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,739
of learning and learning that comes in

284
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:40,760
time that you also pass on that

285
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:44,390
knowledge so that was me between 18 and

286
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,610
20 years of age I went to university at

287
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,620
the end of the day having a university

288
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,209
degree or a degree doesn't really matter

289
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,329
what it is university or nose or a

290
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,979
diploma when you go to a job interview

291
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:57,020
the first thing that I will take a look

292
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:00,380
at is whether you have a degree or not

293
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:03,230
or a diploma for instance in IBM there

294
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:06,140
are many engineers but just wanted

295
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:08,149
University a degree that means that you

296
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,829
commit to something just tell something

297
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:12,050
you finish something you have completed

298
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:14,599
something so that means that you've been

299
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,370
responsible for over four years ok you

300
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,310
know that when you go to university if

301
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,779
you are not responsible you will not be

302
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:26,479
you will not graduate at the end of my

303
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:32,100
theory I noticed that what I was

304
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:34,769
studying I very much liked I changed my

305
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,589
when I was at University I was very

306
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:40,860
motivated i just wanted to go to lessons

307
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:44,759
i just wanted to learn and because i've

308
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,040
also motivated was a very good students

309
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:51,240
i set up companies because i was liking

310
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,149
what i was studying i mentioned that to

311
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,440
a person that i met before I came here I

312
00:15:54,149 --> 00:16:00,779
tell you about my job interview I went

313
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,380
there there was eight of us and they

314
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:05,910
gave us a case that we had to resolve a

315
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,860
juicer case they asked me not to

316
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,389
disclose it okay I cannot tell you but

317
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,860
you have these amount of money you can

318
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:12,600
do this and that and you have to make

319
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,149
the decision which decision did you take

320
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,550
a B or C the eight of us had to agree

321
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:21,810
with each other i sat down i was 22

322
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:24,540
years of age was just graduated and 22

323
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,790
years of hib em you know that there are

324
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:31,500
people seasoned seasoned professionals

325
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:34,319
and that was for an internship with me

326
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:38,160
we had people with to decrease bilingual

327
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:41,310
trilingual one of the ladies is poke

328
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,350
German solid Russian I told her what in

329
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,869
Russians historically speaking Russian

330
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:51,360
but I could not speak Russian and then

331
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:54,360
we did some group dynamics and in this

332
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,269
juicy cage and that man that was a man

333
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,759
who was hired a degree in computer

334
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:02,459
science and heading mathematics everyone

335
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,610
was wearing a suit at that time I didn't

336
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:07,408
have a sudra was very more casual

337
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:10,649
clothing and then we engaged in the

338
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:12,870
debate into discussion it was good

339
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,429
discussion for a discussion because the

340
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:18,658
world war three people from the human

341
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:21,790
resources watching us and then they

342
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:24,280
interviewed and

343
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,500
many people because the position was

344
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,770
very good word for cloud computing they

345
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,380
hired two of us another person I myself

346
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,910
when I joined IBM i went to human

347
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,800
resources departments and i asked the

348
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,500
three people from the human resources

349
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,899
were in that group what they were

350
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,470
expecting what they were looking for in

351
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,300
the people so they told me that there

352
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,490
have been some disagreement in the group

353
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,280
dynamics well in the end we didn't reach

354
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,200
an agreement in the group these a thesis

355
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,710
that what's in that may happen to you in

356
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,050
a job interview anyway they told me

357
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,880
where we didn't care about the result we

358
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:05,169
didn't mind what you did with the money

359
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,720
who you chose we just wanted to see what

360
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:10,000
I do listen to the others what did you

361
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,000
let the others speak some people are

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,310
just thinking about whether going to say

363
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,040
next and they did not listen to the

364
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:20,860
others in the end they were finding

365
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,860
value in the person of course my degree

366
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,229
help me that was just a good starting

367
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,090
point ok they could tell from my degree

368
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,420
that I had a number of attributes of

369
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,760
capacity and then they hired the two of

370
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:37,000
us just ordinary people like myself and

371
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,870
then when i finish i was about to finish

372
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,950
University before I followed the job

373
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:46,810
interview I did the job interview so I

374
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,060
wasn't told this I would have liked

375
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,970
someone to tell me that when you are at

376
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:55,360
university you have time when you have

377
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:58,570
time when you finish University well you

378
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,300
just don't have so much time I worked a

379
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,909
lot on my dissertation it was under

380
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:07,629
technology radio frequency we contacted

381
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:11,920
with Samsung they gave us 50 phones we

382
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:17,350
went to something to report back so that

383
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:21,940
passion was what took us heroes I took

384
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:24,520
us where we got two and then as I say

385
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,590
what university university to have time

386
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,870
and this is what helps you grow as a

387
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:33,280
person which is very important between

388
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:35,100
20 and 25 years of age I joined IBM is

389
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,309
an intern in cloud

390
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,830
building I was seeing very much fond of

391
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:43,889
security but I said okay I brother

392
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:50,159
joined IBM even if I will be doing cloud

393
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:52,169
computing and then I will have the time

394
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,809
that we have and then it's a question of

395
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:56,970
transforming that time into value later

396
00:19:54,809 --> 00:20:01,350
on I will tell you have i've read my CV

397
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:04,140
and in the job interview they did not

398
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:07,080
only assess the type of person that you

399
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,570
are but they also assess other things

400
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,270
that you do these lady the human

401
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:14,100
resources person told me that they very

402
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,289
much like that I was also a basketball

403
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,539
coach because that also means things

404
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:22,580
about yourself and they are looking for

405
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:25,799
people with a curiosity before I joined

406
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:29,309
IBM and say okay I'm going to write my

407
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:32,900
CV I started to write my CV first thing

408
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:35,100
I did was to write on my name them my

409
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:40,020
university degree and I said well I'm

410
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:43,678
what else in any templates as you may

411
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:46,799
notice a job experience certification

412
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,230
for the training and I said what what

413
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,809
can i do and i say job experience I

414
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,190
didn't even write on the field and then

415
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,490
I wrote down everything that I did on

416
00:20:53,190 --> 00:21:00,450
top CTF international competition then I

417
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:05,039
just took part in an essay competition

418
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,929
and so if I were these members of the

419
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,179
team two who were here before I would

420
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:13,110
just highlight in the CV that they

421
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:15,539
wanted challenge all that all that i

422
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,059
showed in big letters and then the

423
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,760
interview says on NASA decent that ok i

424
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,740
will take a closer look at it and then

425
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,129
when hopefully they didn't mind that i

426
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,900
did not had a paragraph with job

427
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,900
experience and this

428
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:40,720
I would have none to know this before I

429
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,928
joined the company when you join the

430
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,140
company do you have a boss and that boss

431
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:50,440
it's a desk the person the person like

432
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:53,350
you and me when I joined the company i

433
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,690
thought that boss was just the entity

434
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:58,090
that you had to flatter I know the

435
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,559
bosses an ordinary person has a family

436
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:04,418
like you had had his lunch his coffee

437
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:10,870
and what happens with that that is good

438
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:16,870
and bad was good or bad well he wants to

439
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:19,989
make a living out of it and having a

440
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:23,830
boss dark cares for you that helps you

441
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:26,110
want to grow well you can have to type

442
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:29,168
of bosses one with interest to help you

443
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,539
develop yourself and those who are not

444
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:35,529
interested in that and as I say I had

445
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:39,179
very many bosses in IBM I've far as i

446
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:43,000
know i have five different boxes i

447
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:47,260
finished my interns after six months and

448
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,740
then the they interview me on TV and

449
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:53,890
then on IBM d they gave me a fixed

450
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,750
contract getting a fixed contract in a

451
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:58,120
large multinational company as well as

452
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,490
in other companies is not easy there is

453
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:04,029
there are lots of temporary jobs and

454
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:07,090
then when I was 24 years of HIV

455
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:09,700
scientific contractor was off at a fixed

456
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:12,490
contract after one year of experience

457
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:16,000
and why is it that well because there

458
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:19,690
was a boss there who took care of me who

459
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,080
that man that boss he fight hard for me

460
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:26,080
he called Europe so that they approved

461
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:29,139
or they open up my position so this

462
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,928
position costs the company lots of money

463
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:35,980
that means that my colleagues at 35

464
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:38,230
years of age some of them are 35 years

465
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,149
of age when I joined the company I was

466
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,419
the youngest and I said when the same as

467
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:47,229
they are I was 23 and next to me was a

468
00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:50,080
man 35 years of age 40 years of age

469
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,669
the daughters were older than me and at

470
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,418
the end of the day you are just want

471
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:58,000
more of them because that was made an

472
00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:00,700
effort so that I could feel like that I

473
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,040
could feel like one more employees so

474
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,460
rather than looking for a super company

475
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:10,149
or superposition look for a boss that's

476
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:17,650
its kind of you that so I found many is

477
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:20,620
amazed run by a person who quit company

478
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:23,130
and decided to set up a small company so

479
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,629
you learn the notes in big companies

480
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:29,650
just in case in the future you open up

481
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:31,840
you SME this is muntaha card and then

482
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,330
the video that i showed you too low six

483
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,070
when we started with our radio programs

484
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,070
okay this is a video of it

485
00:24:52,130 --> 00:25:32,339
[Music]

486
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,610
nahi hago cuando me that well I don't

487
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,340
know but I didn't exist when I gave a

488
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:45,139
talk to answer all this is a haka so I

489
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,600
never would teach it I said that you

490
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,130

brave lad that opens the other way round

514
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,830
so all these things i do it with a

515
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,760
different partner with a different

516
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:22,760
friend feathers this is I did it with

517
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,350
some school friends and nothing about I

518
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:30,620
t and I decided to develop it for them

519
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:35,389
so then these fathers these it's about

520
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:38,719
to come so you can set up an e-commerce

521
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,760
website and the weekends that's what I'm

522
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,310
doing now I have been lots of people for

523
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:47,090
it if you like

524
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:48,980
if you'd like to do it and do develop an

525
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,500
e-commerce site for your friends and

526
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,530
then your friends help you or offer you

527
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,720
to join the company and as I say I'm

528
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,810
always busy when I'm always very happy

529
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,990
here we'll have khaki water this is an

530
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:06,409
example of not success everyone talks

531
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:16,010
about has been everything that has

532
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:19,490
succeeded so it is like targeting or art

533
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:21,620
in so well not everything is wonderful

534
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,330
and perfect at the end of the day we are

535
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,149
20 years of age you set up the business

536
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:29,720
and sometimes a significant attention

537
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:32,030
khaki water we created it then we had to

538
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,820
deserve this but it didn't work out

539
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:36,770
didn't work out so all these things make

540
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,230
you interact with very many different

541
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:43,490
people so people from feathers and the

542
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:45,200
people from kotappa well there are

543
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:49,220
different people we are in different

544
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,990
worlds and these things happen so it is

545
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,230
not a problem at the end of the day if

546
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:57,050
you do not succeed and well Kathy water

547
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:00,560
the company was there for six months we

548
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:03,680
we also wanted to have the waterproof

549
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,810
devices and did not was not being

550
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,990
successful and then we decided to stop

551
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:10,580
and i propose i propose i suggested web

552
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,050
we should stop and say when we kind of

553
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,570
really rich and agreements okay it's

554
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:18,470
better if we close down the company if

555
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:20,419
we shut it down we just chatted it in

556
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:25,070
the best possible manner and that was it

557
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:27,140
so at the end of the day all these is

558
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,460
very good when you are 20 years of age

559
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,400
and you live at home with your parents

560
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:34,520
but when you grow up when you I don't

561
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,230
have a family I'm not fun independent

562
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,480
but when you do all that all these

563
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:40,100
things have to have a meaning to them

564
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,620
because I people say I've been working

565
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:45,139
on an exploit for 10 years well at the

566
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:47,479
end of the day that person would be 18

567
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:50,690
years of age and continue working on his

568
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,120
pledge what is the objective what did

569
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,070
you get out of it what is what you get

570
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,939
out of it perhaps it is not money but it

571
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,629
could be repeated

572
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:02,809
image etc so I just don't want you just

573
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:06,019
to become entrepreneurs without doing it

574
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:09,950
for a minimal meaningful reason for a

575
00:30:06,019 --> 00:30:14,000
purpose what about the clothing brand I

576
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:15,950
now I go to a fashion event and then I

577
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,240
also get money out of it what if a

578
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:21,950
business is not a profitable business

579
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,600
well it is just it will just fail some

580
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,039
teaser for me i hope that you liked it

581
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,209
and I'm here to take any questions that

582
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:32,759
you may have

583
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:32,759
[Applause]
