communist everyone thank you very much

25
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:43,239
this is the beginning of a beautiful

26
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:46,859
story we are in 2016 but we need to say

27
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,709
that black in 2015 the dd4 in serum

28
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:53,109
recruited a group of talented people

29
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:55,180
very talented technically speaking

30
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:58,359
talented people this was a selection

31
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:01,719
that could win the cybersecurity

32
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:04,590
challenge in Europe 2015 they were the

33
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:08,680
new team they revealed him and 2016

34
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:12,750
Spain second year and they got the gold

35
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:19,079
medal and there's a team right travel

36
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:24,070
that made it do you have a question as

37
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:27,159
you can see they've work as a team but

38
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:30,820
they did not compete last year jointly

39
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:33,280
each of them just like you compete it

40
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:36,969
individually against each other but this

41
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,280
year they were a team and even if we are

42
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,930
a team you can see it's difficult to

43
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,508
even choose the same t-shirt you saw

44
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,630
that in the picture so well let me ask

45
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:50,259
you a few questions and this has to do

46
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:53,530
with it what did you find a bit more

47
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:56,550
difficult to work as a team any of you

48
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,549
can take the question

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,240
huzi

50
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:11,850
now the most difficult thing as a team

51
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,830
has been coordination and communication

52
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,500
since each of us we are used to working

53
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,159
individually so whenever we get

54
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,440
information or we make progress we shred

55
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,080
it you may keep it for ourselves and we

56
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,640
want to go all the way through and maybe

57
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,680
to work as a team it would be better to

58
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,370
communicate and have the whole team work

59
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:37,900
together on these advances and those

60
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,880
progresses this magical thing that maybe

61
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,760
some of the young people in the room

62
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,790
will be part of the selection next year

63
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,080
but it's also about training is gyms and

64
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,820
many more things you need to be trained

65
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,729
on Borja what did you like the most

66
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,620
about this instruction time but you had

67
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:57,790
different instructors even for my

68
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:03,310
colleagues from 2015 Thank You boja for

69
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:05,410
your comments the best part was how we

70
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,300
understood each other from the very

71
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,390
beginning we've been so very coordinated

72
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,310
as houses said it was difficult to start

73
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,520
being coordinated but it's always been a

74
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,920
team of people who's knowledgeable of

75
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,840
the sector and we look into floral and

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,610
it was not so difficult to become a good

77
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,080
team that's what they say now right the

78
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,169
way you should have seen them first day

79
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:30,010
coming in till they get coordinated by

80
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:32,229
the way but well I a Bolivia what would

81
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:34,300
you say to those that are competing here

82
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:38,790
today are going to compete tomorrow what

83
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,790
would you say about this competition

84
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,440
captain

85
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:47,440
basically those who played today do not

86
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,469
get scared keep competing keep fighting

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,169
against anyone at any level they can do

88
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,370
it and they've proven their capabilities

89
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:56,590
and they've always managed to learn

90
00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:00,010
something and those competing tomorrow

91
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:02,979
was not the same it's just the same do

92
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:05,110
not get scared and go for it and we have

93
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:08,530
this one person who we thought would not

94
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:14,689
do much it's pablor the youngest one

95
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:17,599
coming from cyber Olympics that's a name

96
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:20,749
Pavla got so very integrated into the

97
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:24,259
group and so what about the come to stay

98
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:25,369
as it is said adrenaline kicking in what

99
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:28,939
did you like the most

100
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:32,719
phasing and up ten teams I don't really

101
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:35,599
know I wouldn't know I actually did not

102
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:38,269
have experience I had not participated

103
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,498
in many of these contests and we have

104
00:07:38,269 --> 00:07:44,569
cyber Olympic in this year a few but has

105
00:07:42,499 --> 00:07:46,459
nothing to do us with a real competition

106
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:49,039
with pleasure

107
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:51,379
you're under and there's ten teams with

108
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:56,748
the top ten hackers from every country

109
00:07:51,379 --> 00:08:00,800
so it is serious and so stressful minute

110
00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:03,349
one and you need to take answers get the

111
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,769
flags and get school and for whatever

112
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:08,748
the reason mark registers do not work

113
00:08:06,769 --> 00:08:11,269
the school registers do not work so they

114
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:13,789
we're stressing and pressing so minute

115
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:16,729
one stress all the way to the end even

116
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:18,378
though we were quite ahead of them but

117
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,389
it is true there's a lot of stress and

118
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:23,269
pressure and this is a constant and the

119
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:29,229
worst minute worst minute of formal

120
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:33,188
competition what was it one godless I

121
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:38,688
know you don't like it but what was it

122
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:41,208
Romania takes ahead of us I don't know

123
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:46,610
stress this tension that don't know what

124
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:48,229
to say did you think something what we

125
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:53,000
thought we win because we always win

126
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:57,139
right I have to say that was something

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,379
that really would help we were feeling

128
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:05,930
unmotivated and we got there we had just

129
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:10,670
a tiny room for five people

130
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:15,829
no towels no soap only bunk beds and

131
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:17,930
then we go there and they we had a limit

132
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:20,569
a cop a budget cop saying that it was

133
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,758
300 euros and they had a server and we

134
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:26,029
knew it was much more expensive and you

135
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:27,980
see we were fighting this so we go to

136
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,500
the verse and in the end

137
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,779
they say that if they had a server they

138
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,510
keep it and we were down we were feeling

139
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:37,670
terrible and then Tanya decided to

140
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,800
encourage the team gelling around

141
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,620
Spanish way even when the team had not

142
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,269
achieved a theme and you see there was a

143
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,389
second target there it's not just

144
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:50,269
encouraging them but DS encouraged all

145
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:54,740
others in this we heard at night it

146
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:57,220
works it might be good to create number

147
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:02,720
two and three we had no Flags back then

148
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:05,029
but there was anxiety it is true when we

149
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,260
were called to the jury we thought what

150
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:10,550
did we do because you know walking

151
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:18,439
around well they are good but they are

152
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:21,199
even scary so my question is Antonia and

153
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,019
I what would what what did we miss

154
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:30,380
it's cannot be told oh we would be

155
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:33,649
quietly fine okay okay Raul said that

156
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,949
they have their plays and password

157
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:38,660
hacking you know up know they have a to

158
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:42,500
structure mine

159
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:45,439
Spain we always so did art always do but

160
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:51,339
Adrian what secret tool did we have

161
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:55,930
available when it is released Europe

162
00:10:51,339 --> 00:11:00,290
trembles this is Daniel spec no trick

163
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:02,239
Daniel maybe people don't know what it

164
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:07,880
is do you don't know what Daniel's book

165
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:11,839
is so it's a book and a pen and works

166
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,410
just as well as a cracking server when

167
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,470
Daniel gets his book not now too big ass

168
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,990
Europe trembles I have a question what's

169
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,000
the best thing you lift Daniel your best

170
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:27,500
experience what you like most everything

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,699
there's nothing that I like better or

172
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:37,190
worse competition training competition

173
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:41,949
what they like released was the hotel

174
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,949
room me miss as well

175
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:49,910
so having fun of course because with

176
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:54,410
your proud right this I said it last

177
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:56,180
year this is something that you need to

178
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,770
understand you do it for you yourself

179
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,620
your family or your country that's what

180
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:03,199
you this stands for this time around it

181
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,560
was a Spain that we were representing

182
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,070
and it would be nice just discuss would

183
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,489
you understand what's a party when you

184
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,490
win

185
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,870
what's the after party so the picture

186
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,430
that comes to mind cannot be revealed

187
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:21,830
well so nice very nice Spanish team not

188
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:25,550
just technically but we earned the

189
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:28,700
respect because yes the Spain is

190
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:31,569
understood as party yes but we knew how

191
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:35,900
to go in other countries do not have fun

192
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:37,880
and even those scoring worst what

193
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,980
matters in the end is meeting people

194
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,770
from other countries that have yours and

195
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,110
your preferences same ideas and we had

196
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:48,110
so much fun so I really recommend that

197
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:52,490
because it's all worth it as you can see

198
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:56,150
we had fun and we did so many things so

199
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:59,210
if you agree because it seems

200
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,910
technically we haven't shown anything we

201
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,990
had some people that had a presentation

202
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,120
ready for it

203
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,820
example case that you can find maybe

204
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,210
next year for this competition and if

205
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,940
you agree Antonia we move on to two team

206
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:18,170
members to get ready housing and Danny

207
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:24,080
and they will technically show you what

208
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:26,469
the challenges are where around I'm

209
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,180
hoping Matthew Roja is Anil Fernandez

210
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,670
this is a short presentation on the

211
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,209
competition itself and a couple of

212
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:45,640
challenges that we've come across

213
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:49,060
specifically one scoring class so the

214
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,579
the series of fathers categories where

215
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:55,680
you would get a school and we would tell

216
00:13:51,579 --> 00:14:00,250
apart talk and defense and jeopardy and

217
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:04,420
achievements we had the core of the

218
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,149
contest that was defense an attack where

219
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,160
different classes were scored such a

220
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:11,079
availability called pocheon attack

221
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,019
defense and then a special one that was

222
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:17,229
power net that was doing something that

223
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:21,279
is not supposed to be done a black hole

224
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:25,029
into the organizations here it was about

225
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:27,160
attacking other teams servers as we

226
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:31,450
would defend our service at the same

227
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:35,469
time and patch code as well to cover all

228
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:39,130
vulnerabilities then jeopardy it is a

229
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:41,290
flat capture as we've seen before this

230
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,790
is a challenges from different classes

231
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:48,189
that you need to solve then achievements

232
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:52,839
which basically between performing a

233
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:55,540
task such as setting up an intermediate

234
00:14:52,839 --> 00:15:00,790
CA from a CA that is given to you and

235
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:04,709
develop a small up managing privileges

236
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:09,790
based on the certificate signed by set

237
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:13,660
element or buddy the CTF architecture

238
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:19,990
was like these there was one servant and

239
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:23,560
one MV where one for each there was two

240
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:26,649
servers so four of them total hours was

241
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,339
inside the machine and another one to

242
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:33,820
which we have no access the access to

243
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:36,250
that we got it through a gate to correct

244
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:39,640
vulnerabilities the deploy was automated

245
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:42,820
so we only had access you out to the rid

246
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:46,360
in our server so we followed the DISA

247
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,920
strategy the defense server we did

248
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,279
everything we could we started the web

249
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,890
server to each machine they had an

250
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,890
element and we added an engine engine

251
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,560
together with the Apache and that we

252
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:05,180
would have control over all the attacks

253
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:10,489
that we would get in and then also gold

254
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:13,939
fortune we we covered it all of us

255
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,610
together so this is a short cryptography

256
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:20,000
challenge that we had we would get a

257
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,700
private errors are is a password or code

258
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,450
key sorry but part of the private key

259
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:30,560
was comfort concealed so you see we have

260
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:33,680
an access to basis 64 which itself is

261
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:42,050
valid so we can extract information out

262
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:44,479
of it as we will see in a minute good so

263
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:50,620
you know how private chains work

264
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,620
does it ring a bell does not okay

265
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:58,610
basically this information on the screen

266
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:01,280
would be the hexadecimal number the

267
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:09,250
format of the number those asterisks put

268
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:09,250
equals this so this is Ana specification

269
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:22,270
to define RSA parameters a private key

270
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:25,579
so the last part of the key was this so

271
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:33,560
if you know how RSA works those are

272
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:35,659
prime numbers and so it was the end but

273
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,679
it was not complete we would have de

274
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:43,850
coud we have DP DQ and Qi how they'll

275
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:48,350
explain what it is we have a small part

276
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:53,030
of prime Q number we've got D P which is

277
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:56,000
CR T sub index of super in the support

278
00:17:53,030 --> 00:18:01,070
for the one the first one and Q it's the

279
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,030
CRT coefficient for reverse q CR T

280
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:07,810
stands for Chinese remainder so it's the

281
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:09,530
country to a modulo operation and

282
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,710
basically

283
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:14,750
just an optimization to locate it in a

284
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,600
reasonable time so what do we news we

285
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:20,510
need to find the premium is P and Q that

286
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,840
are the private game and to get there we

287
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:27,710
use math math formulae that define our s

288
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,310
a and we can see that on the top right

289
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,910
side

290
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:35,000
but when developed are located on the

291
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:39,350
lower right side and we play around and

292
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,370
we get P and Q using the last digits for

293
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:48,620
Q so we have this item Python script

294
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:53,389
that will help us find the numbers what

295
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:56,659
did we do we had a Python script to

296
00:18:53,390 --> 00:19:01,100
solve equations and get the original

297
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:05,420
prime numbers it's worth to say that

298
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,159
this function that says prime numbers

299
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,540
not to check whether it's a prime number

300
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,690
but to make sure that there is a valid

301
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:14,060
candidate for the coefficient in a

302
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,920
nutshell we needed to have prime numbers

303
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,649
P and Q that were part of the private

304
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,870
key and through math formula we could

305
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,230
get them that was a challenge and this

306
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:26,929
one of the challenges we liked the most

307
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:29,420
so let's expose it for attack and

308
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:34,310
defense one of the applications and how

309
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:40,990
we gained control of the system this is

310
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:40,990
an app and so pictures could be uploaded

311
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,449
demouth a so this is a platform where we

312
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:51,080
could upload images and alike and we had

313
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:56,150
the information we were told that we

314
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,860
have this back door and then we took a

315
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,650
look at we found everything that was

316
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,740
located in the server and then even the

317
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:07,610
image if you had embedded information

318
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:10,130
that is to say pixels of the image were

319
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,030
instructed and then we execute it like

320
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:16,760
if it were Python code so therefore it

321
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,820
was just a remote execution of the code

322
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,860
so therefore we have an invitation

323
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:26,100
access to give we didn't have food

324
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:30,750
access to all hall code of the app so we

325
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:33,299
didn't know how to fix it so where the

326
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:36,360
solution would be modifying the give big

327
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:38,700
image but the idea image solution would

328
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,219
have been to remove the factor but we

329
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,340
couldn't do it so we decided to self

330
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,340
attack to attack ourselves and then just

331
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,320
to disappear from the server and well

332
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,360
for whatever reason the other teams

333
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,120
didn't do it didn't do the same thing

334
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,168
and they'd left that open so basically

335
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:01,018
the pone category comes from remote code

336
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:05,970
execution so it is a special category

337
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:07,799
with its own screen and well well we

338
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,730
just wanted you know we were so

339
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:14,879
satisfied to have achieved it well last

340
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:18,299
year the Latin our team was not the

341
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,830
winner and well we repeated this year we

342
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,000
attempted this year again we are

343
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:26,879
extremely satisfied so once we have our

344
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,940
CRT the remote code execution then we

345
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:37,289
want just to escalate privileges we just

346
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:39,210
want to get root access there are

347
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:40,740
different ways to do it and you never

348
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,679
know you never know whether it is

349
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,539
possible or not so we just decided that

350
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,700
we wanted to do it we were Restless that

351
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:49,620
we wanted to do it and then last

352
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,110
September there was a new vulnerability

353
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,629
out there that were had a huge impact on

354
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:57,990
them decided to just too bad for it and

355
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,909
I say well they fix it or not and then

356
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,100
it takes 20 or 30 minutes to try it

357
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,500
because in carrying out all these tests

358
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,299
is tedious is it worthwhile spending our

359
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,200
time on that wasting our time on that

360
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:12,059
this was widely widely discussed but we

361
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:14,610
didn't know whether the vulnerability

362
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:18,600
had been fixed or not so here it was the

363
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:20,309
right time or the time for us to test

364
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,010
these ok whether there was something

365
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:25,769
strange or not and then well regarding

366
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,570
the vulnerability well does this ring a

367
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:31,440
bell to you have you seen this before

368
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,820
you haven't seen it before that's the

369
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,750
dirty cow

370
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,200
some of you now

371
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:40,390
have they fixed it well we supposed that

372
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,570
it was fixed and I said well is it worth

373
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:47,520
our time to try and fix it well actually

374
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:50,169
they had not fixed it

375
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,040
therefore vulnerability was still there

376
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:57,820
in September and there is a

377
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:00,850
vulnerability that allows you to write

378
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:05,110
in any file of the heart risk with any

379
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:09,129
username ah then how did you get root do

380
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:11,530
they rightly binary and you run it and

381
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,830
that's it and you have root but the

382
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,809
problem that we'll have with that is the

383
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:19,120
situation is that it is very stable

384
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:21,990
well this table is not not only this

385
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,120
plate is not unstable but the

386
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:28,240
proof-of-concept example leave the

387
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,889
machines in and stable state because

388
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,110
they are not well implemented so to

389
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:35,260
speak so this is blood leaves the

390
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:37,840
machine in an unconscious state so if

391
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,960
someone you see anyone use it then an

392
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,360
accident may occur one of the rules of

393
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,370
this competition was to not sabotage you

394
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,250
cannot really sabotage your adversary's

395
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,350
we had access to the fruit of the

396
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,330
computer we could not sabotage them we

397
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,969
could not spy them we could not read

398
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,639
their code so the jury came to us

399
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:01,690
expressly and said please please you

400
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:04,420
cannot use these they remanded as in

401
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:07,660
that and as I said this was very very

402
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:10,000
unstable well the problem of it being

403
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:13,120
unstable is well on the one hand you can

404
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,660
fix it with what you see here on top of

405
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,659
the screen

406
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,950
and then we decided to take advantage of

407
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:27,350
this flocking colonel and the first

408
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:31,640
thing that we did was to disable this

409
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:35,480
statement that says on top so this time

410
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:39,950
the file in the hard-disk

411
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:47,740
cannot be overwritten and it also fix a

412
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:52,790
problem of kernel panic the problem was

413
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:55,640
well the memory was corrupt so we didn't

414
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:59,899
see anything the server was not left

415
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:03,200
unstable but but they British didn't do

416
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:05,600
but with this we'll have to say that we

417
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,980
did pound we were the first ones to do

418
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,168
it and then the British team repeated

419
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:16,340
but they repeated against lishus time

420
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:22,370
team but the ones that they weren't able

421
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:25,668
to have stable machine and they flooded

422
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:29,360
they flooded the licious time machines

423
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:31,610
and then they decided to reconsider

424
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,979
whether there was sabotage or not on the

425
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,979
part of English and that was against the

426
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:40,580
rules and then the captain of the

427
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,130
British team had to swear that there was

428
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,939
not ill intended that it was just an

429
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:50,140
accident so we were showing us an

430
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:53,000
example they said the Spanish team

431
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,160
executed the same exploit but nothing

432
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,230
went wrong they knew how to date of

433
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,020
right so they had the necessary

434
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:03,470
knowledge to get it right and we'll have

435
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:07,220
to say that the invoice of Annisa the

436
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:09,470
European agency was completely against

437
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:14,020
this philosophy as I said well we just

438
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:17,419
want to Train professionals that really

439
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:23,270
fit to this category we just don't want

440
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:26,630
to train people who will misbehave so it

441
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:30,080
is good that we our team need how to

442
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,029
make a proper use of it and how to keep

443
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,119
and stick to all the

444
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:38,029
rules of competition so this formula

445
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:41,330
says that if we act as a team we will

446
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:43,580
get much more further than if we act

447
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:46,849
individually there were other teams

448
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:49,129
there that were very strong however they

449
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:50,960
were acting individually they were not

450
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:53,090
communicating with each other they

451
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,989
wanted to work individually and that was

452
00:26:53,090 --> 00:27:00,228
a hindrance for many teams and I have to

453
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:02,599
say that lasya also was in the Spanish

454
00:27:00,229 --> 00:27:04,399
team that was my second year and a

455
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,599
significant difference from last year to

456
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:10,728
this year is that plus year we had less

457
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,889
organization we may mean as a team we

458
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,139
were blessed organized last year's team

459
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:17,748
had talent however we were not as well

460
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:20,238
organized and this year we improved a

461
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:24,289
lot in terms of organization we each of

462
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:26,629
us has clearly defined tasks we made up

463
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:31,179
a team and we each have a role and

464
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:36,019
function in the team and this is what

465
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:38,839
helped us gain scores points up until we

466
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:40,460
just ended up winning the competition so

467
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:51,789
this is affirm us thank you very much

468
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:57,109
for your attention rights because speak

469
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:59,539
imitation speak louder than words and we

470
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,939
want to play a video so that you'll have

471
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:05,919
a field so that you can experience four

472
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,919
hands but the challenge was about

473
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,470

do you think more members of the team in

482
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:17,110
the video that couldn't make it today

483
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,570
Pablo he may know our hell and there are

484
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:21,790
very many other people behind these team

485
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,560
not only us I would like to call to the

486
