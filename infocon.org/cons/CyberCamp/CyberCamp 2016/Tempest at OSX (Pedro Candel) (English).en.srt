1
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:09,929
good morning so my name is bedrock until

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:15,088
I come from cyber soccer academy from

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:19,289
delois and I will give you some

4
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:25,050
introductory concepts to follow my

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:28,439
presentation so first of all I would

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,539
start by sharing with you well first of

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,809
all let me apologize because these

8
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:37,590
presentation is in English and Wes

9
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,328
Antonio very once said we really need to

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,329
have a good understanding of English

11
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,149
that will help us out a lot so a covered

12
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,360
channel is what the definition that will

13
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,809
have for it it says on the screen and it

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,699
is something that we can use we have

15
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,959
we've been using cover channels through

16
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,910
traditional means to communicate

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:05,159
camouflaged information and also

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:08,729
transferring information about system in

19
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,760
with an effect on the system load so we

20
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:15,780
will see whether we will manage to

21
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:24,140
recover to discover Rome or not Tempest

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:27,780
is built by the NSA and this is also a

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:31,560
certification said NATO certification

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:38,420
and what is it about it is about p anoj

25
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:43,320
have our information system and it is

26
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:46,140
about also leaking emanations including

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,630
an intentional radio electrical signal

28
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:55,860
sounds and vibration so tempest covers

29
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:59,130
everything and it also tells us how to

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,890
shield how to protect our equipment

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,250
against spying and here we are talking

32
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:11,209
about all the industry standard such as

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:14,290
e m sec on other ones and this is just

34
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:17,230
we have come sec which is of

35
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:22,120
referred to as m/sec but this is about

36
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:25,719
about a TBR and nowadays the NSA's our

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,739
friends are saying well I do it myself I

38
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:32,379
shoot myself and I'm going to classify

39
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:35,709
it but i'm going to give you these

40
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:39,280
things so that everyone follows us and

41
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:41,109
everyone do whatever we do and they said

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,379
okay i'm going to tell you what you have

43
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:46,959
to do and how you will have to shield

44
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:51,730
your equipment the distance that you

45
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,790
should have in between your systems or

46
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,959
the distance from the world the type of

47
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:07,980
cables that we have to use shielding etc

48
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:11,220
basically here we have the sound

49
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:17,738
dimension and here we have mechanical

50
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:21,790
vibrations and technically we also heard

51
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:25,419
about the possibility to have mobile

52
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:28,929
sensors to recover everything that has

53
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:32,470
been written I've seen something in that

54
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:40,180
regard but I haven't seen it in full

55
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:47,440
operation so tempest attacks it is an

56
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:54,180
attack which is based on a principle the

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:57,668
principle of electromagnetic radiation

58
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:01,449
during a normal use any type of device

59
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:05,470
whether it is a fax machine we have them

60
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:10,979
we have them out there with the correct

61
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:15,250
equipment such as antennas receivers

62
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:18,489
display units in theory in theory I'm

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,279
saying in theory because there are some

64
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:25,090
there is some security in place in

65
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,900
theory from a remote location we could

66
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:33,960
try and see those sick

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:37,349
and to reconstruct the original sin

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:40,409
signal if I am working with a cpu and if

69
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,289
I am transmitting zeros and ones and if

70
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:48,110
that is radiated to the full to the

71
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:48,110
spectrum perhaps we could end up

72
00:04:49,400 --> 00:05:01,169
receiving that remotely and to get at

73
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:06,139
the original signals and imagine that if

74
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:10,530
these were possible how it could be

75
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:16,110
misused to violate your privacy well the

76
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:19,109
equipment is emanating these signals and

77
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,599
is radiating all these disease implicit

78
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,479
this is not nothing a strange we

79
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:27,840
shouldn't be paranoid about that it is

80
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,258
quite a complex attack to reproduce to

81
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,750
carry out but in theory as I said it

82
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,150
could be possible we cannot really end

83
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:41,880
up like these people here wearing this

84
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:43,799
hat so that they do not take our brain

85
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,960
waves and so that they just cannot

86
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,300
follow our thoughts this is an attack in

87
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,710
principle that cannot be detected

88
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:59,669
because it is a passive attack as I say

89
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:03,229
we are radiating radiations and as I say

90
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:05,849
from a remote location we should try to

91
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:08,580
reconstruct we could try and reconstruct

92
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:12,240
that signal and we could do that from

93
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:16,859
any point and the problem here is that

94
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,949
any electronic device emits to a higher

95
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,500
or lower extent electromagnetic

96
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:30,930
radiation and an ongoing basis and

97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:34,680
actually the CPU is radiating the

98
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,260
highest level of electromagnetic

99
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,100
radiation I'm not going to go into

100
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,760
voltage here and we are just tell you

101
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,480
that we are generating we are generating

102
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:52,650
electromagnetic pulses that radiates and

103
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:54,990
actually the standard is telling us to

104
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:59,840
shield our equipment for instance there

105
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:04,410
are stickers and see a confirmative

106
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:08,190
adhesive sticky adhesive and then this

107
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:10,710
is being copied by the Chinese and that

108
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,400
they put in their fake equipment so this

109
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:18,020
is the circuit here will have a circuit

110
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,299
board have here we see the actual

111
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,599
radiation from the actual bus and then

112
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:29,280
we'll have all these cables and here we

113
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:32,880
see a cups cups in between the circuit

114
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:40,380
board the sashes all that all that could

115
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:44,010
be because it has radiation it could be

116
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:48,930
subject to an attack is that a myth or

117
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:52,530
reality so let us see what could happen

118
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:56,520
if we have a middle of the night attack

119
00:07:52,530 --> 00:08:00,179
that is to say someone who from any

120
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,299
location enters your home or your office

121
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,910
you just these plays a big antenna

122
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,430
brings out a big antenna and then

123
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,680
reconstruct our signals and end up

124
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:15,240
knowing what we are doing is that true

125
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:18,810
or not well I decided to demystify this

126
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,900
and I said okay I'm going to put myself

127
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,420
in the shoes of these people and see

128
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,760
whether this is a myth or reality the

129
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:31,230
first thing that I found was an email

130
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:37,200
from the 18th of August 1999 we are in

131
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:40,650
an 2016 nearly finishing and here notice

132
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,670
that that was already written in 1999

133
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:51,689
and that person took tea and source code

134
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:55,040
in C and that use the monitor the big

135
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:59,160
monitors at the time

136
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,399
that it could have transmitted a song a

137
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,920
song that was received in a device such

138
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,319
as dad on the screen so here there are

139
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,599
there's lots of young talent and perhaps

140
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:13,620
you don't know what that is that is a

141
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:18,209
traditional radio traditional radio we

142
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:23,519
had cassette tapes at that time well

143
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:27,089
that device had track singh it melodies

144
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,720
in it and it also hot dark a capability

145
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:34,259
so today we have the Raspberry Pi and it

146
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,589
could become an FM transmitter this is

147
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:41,060
one of the projects and the problem here

148
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:44,970
imagine that we want to exfiltrate data

149
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:49,199
from a device we have to go there with

150
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:52,430
our Raspberry Pi and then to set up all

151
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:56,040
that the infrastructure to take out that

152
00:09:52,430 --> 00:10:00,079
radiation well also recent projects this

153
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:04,519
year we had these we had the disk

154
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:09,239
filtration attacked from 11th of echos

155
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:12,060
2016 and actually here we see the noise

156
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,600
generated by the hardest where you can

157
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:19,709
use that noise you can take it you can

158
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:23,339
use it to exfiltrate data and it has

159
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:28,880
been proven that you can do it and then

160
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:31,949
also you can also use funds for that

161
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,189
very same people decided that they

162
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:37,769
wanted to transmit information well we

163
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:42,449
know that fans are all the time rotating

164
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:44,910
who perhaps when you are doing specific

165
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:47,729
operation the fun does not rotate as

166
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:50,009
much that movement is being analyzed in

167
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,439
every mode on every modes equipment and

168
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:54,990
apparently you can exfiltrate data from

169
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:59,879
that and now let us talk about 10 packs

170
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:03,209
over a OS X this is a new channel a new

171
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:06,630
cover channel and this is we have a

172
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:08,400
project this is not mine project this is

173
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,189
the starting point

174
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:15,180
and I it called my attention these

175
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:19,650
people said well they just transmit it

176
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:22,589
on radio with no specific no a

177
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:24,930
specialized the hard work just with the

178
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:28,380
circuit board and I started to take a

179
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:32,000
look at it and when I went deeper into

180
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:35,370
it and I could see what they were doing

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,840
this is what i found this is basically

182
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:42,740
about x running instructions on the

183
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,170
computer that will cause the

184
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:49,350
electromagnetic radiation we want the

185
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,020
equipment to do that for that for us how

186
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,200
do you do that well actually by sending

187
00:11:52,020 --> 00:12:00,990
out sheets to the CPU so we are not

188
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:03,930
sending anything meaningful or nice we

189
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:06,990
just sent out a huge number of zeros and

190
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:11,670
ones and we try just to trigger

191
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:14,100
something and for that the actual intel

192
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:21,540
here we can see number of instructions

193
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:24,390
mmn string with 31 with 3228 these are

194
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,240
not the only ones because here you

195
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:33,180
cannot does not allow you to to do it

196
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:35,490
and therefore when you research into it

197
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:39,089
you find out that we could transmit

198
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,430
information via radio carrier wave i'm

199
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,100
not going to focus on these very much

200
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:47,370
and just to tell you that in that case

201
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,730
we should look at how to transmit it

202
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:53,660
this is the way they did it after

203
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:57,480
instance weave through the mmmh string

204
00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:01,860
that causes is significant or strong

205
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,530
signal this is not the only one signal

206
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,590
and we can increase the intensity of it

207
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:15,390
this is the radio electrical spectrum

208
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:21,120
and in principle well we decide to stick

209
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:24,760
to the Midwife why that's why midwife

210
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,660
well probably none of us is carrying a

211
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:36,640
radio in the pocket if we cover radio

212
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:38,530
Radio has FM and basically this is some

213
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,199
of the code that is being used for it

214
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:44,319
calculated four times you calculate this

215
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,930
and that then when you fine-tune it so

216
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,200
you can end up doing good amount of

217
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:54,219
things and here let us talk about Morse

218
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:56,680
code Morse code we have it there and

219
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,390
that will help us transmit a message in

220
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,150
Morse and this time we will take

221
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:09,210
advantage we will use the dot the /

222
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:13,689
space etc etc and then we will try to

223
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:18,640
use it to make the most out of it Morse

224
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:20,530
code will have the oldest characters

225
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:27,910
these ordinary characters and then

226
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:31,780
numbers from 1 to 0 what typical thing

227
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:38,140
I'm sure everyone has talked about SOS

228
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:42,310
three dots all three slashes that would

229
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:45,420
be enough for us to come close to its to

230
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,420
see how it works

231
00:14:52,120 --> 00:15:11,980
but I need this switch screen so this is

232
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:16,270
the source code that's where we define

233
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:18,640
the length the instructions the logo

234
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:22,870
which is an octopus because it hides

235
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:26,620
itself and this is the alphabets that we

236
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:38,050
will be using we will reduce him from

237
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:44,529
letter ed dog t / logotype okay and see

238
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:52,810
if it works this is transmitter I will

239
00:15:44,529 --> 00:16:00,550
compile it this is immediate we will run

240
00:15:52,810 --> 00:16:07,630
it when I lost the logo well logo looks

241
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:15,729
nice so imagine that you want to

242
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:18,670
transmit instead of SOS imagine that I

243
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:22,779
want to transmit the following message

244
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:27,010
hello there oh hello people or cracks at

245
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:31,000
cyber camp imagine that this is a

246
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:35,050
message that I want to transmit you

247
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,700
cannot see it but well the device is not

248
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:43,900
log on to anywhere and now I need a

249
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:47,380
receptor if it is going to radiate Moors

250
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:50,520
I need to listen to it somewhere so I

251
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:55,709
always ask the same question who has a

252
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:58,630
radio an old radio radio with him oh

253
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:00,109
sorry i am being blinded by the oldies

254
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:04,250
nights

255
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:07,849
so no one is carrying a radio set on

256
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:11,209
them all right so no one so therefore I

257
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:13,688
will tell you how you should tune it so

258
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:17,689
this is a radio set it is just

259
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:22,549
traditional an ordinary radio set and it

260
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:24,890
has am/fm has an antenna i had this knob

261
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:28,790
here for tuning in the channel and is

262
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:31,809
the other one for volume this is FM and

263
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,809
this is am

264
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,960
so here you can see the letters

265
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:25,840
does the bus of CPU amplification

266
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:28,510
harmonics etc standard Morse code so we

267
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,840
are listening to the dots two slashes

268
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:55,000
and the device is not log on to log on

269
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:58,418
anywhere this is ok where is good well

270
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,700
from the technical viewpoints but what

271
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:02,970
is the problem the problem that we will

272
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,970
have

273
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,800
well apologies for these technical

274
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,800
details

275
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:46,730
as I was saying we have a problem I have

276
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:53,210
a broadcast transmission anyone with a

277
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:56,930
radio set well let me tell you that this

278
00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:00,440
is not a big a meter it is very much

279
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:03,380
limited by distance but if you are close

280
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,770
enough to it you can hear it and if I

281
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:09,320
send out an a later you will hear dot

282
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:12,050
slash and you will perfectly

283
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:17,689
understandable perfectly here at that

284
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:20,149
point and that / and now we need to have

285
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:25,760
a personal machine able to understand

286
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:28,580
Morse code then i also have a huge

287
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,210
problem with binary files imagine that i

288
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:36,889
want to take a binary file and then

289
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:40,130
Morse code i only have from A to Z and

290
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:44,090
then from 0 to 9 and what I'm going to

291
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:46,760
do with the rest of characters a look at

292
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:49,399
those characters that different

293
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,190
characters that are weaving binary code

294
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:56,660
and all that is limited by the set of

295
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:59,960
characters that I'm using so therefore

296
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:04,130
let us try to fix those problems first

297
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:07,280
of all we can play with the speed of

298
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:12,740
transmission we wanted to be very well

299
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:15,950
but would I get out of it well my test

300
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:18,140
was very slow so that you could follow

301
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:23,960
me so that we could understand that it

302
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:28,130
was a daughter / it as a / hope whatever

303
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:33,800
but I could also play around with

304
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:39,470
variable speed sometimes we use these

305
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,629
etfs to see what type of things people

306
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:45,050
are playing around with and the best

307
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:48,050
thing is just to install to have a CTF

308
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:54,070
wherever we had our

309
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:57,350
Moore's message and to pick up the

310
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,659
signals and then to find out about the

311
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:02,959
transmission speed of the machine as you

312
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:05,990
can see but this is logical will have a

313
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,780
variable speeding words per minute will

314
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:12,410
have the dots length the optimum

315
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:14,420
bandwidth that we need that phone we can

316
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,560
start playing around with it with the

317
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:23,540
programs and with the automatic

318
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:26,570
receptors and the receivers that we used

319
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:29,960
and same as when we work with our

320
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:32,120
walkie-talkies and then we said okay it

321
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,440
is good that I am getting your most

322
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:43,060
message and we could hey around if not

323
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:45,080
and then also for exfiltrating data from

324
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:52,669
Pittman's we could do something like

325
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:55,340
this I have to transmit something that

326
00:22:52,670 --> 00:23:00,560
only the receiver of the information

327
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:01,939
will understand even if anyone intercept

328
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,220
start message if there is an

329
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,350
interception of the message and we

330
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,830
learnt the lesson we learned the lesson

331
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:12,290
many times we learnt it unfortunately

332
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,800
from Graham somewhere while we're going

333
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:19,100
to take what are we going to do with it

334
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:24,860
in the receiver of information I'm going

335
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:27,949
to play with cryptography with public

336
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,649
keys and with private keys first of all

337
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:34,550
I'm going to create a tempest and I'm

338
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:37,550
going to extract the public key and the

339
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:40,220
private one will be kept in the receptor

340
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:42,950
and then I'm going to generate a random

341
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,460
password that could be for instance I

342
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:51,770
don't know 1b V and then I'm going to

343
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:57,650
encrypt files with this password and I'm

344
00:23:51,770 --> 00:24:00,440
going to do it with aes 256 CBC for a

345
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,730
very simple reason because we need an

346
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,330
encryption that can

347
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:07,690
reversed then if I recover the IV that

348
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:12,590
is to say the password and I randomly

349
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:16,880
generated I'm going to reverse it by the

350
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:22,840
time i have it on the receiver then that

351
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:28,520
IV together with that public key file

352
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:31,929
I'm going to encrypt it with an RSA 1496

353
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:36,260
and rest i'm going to encode files on

354
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:39,830
base 64 i'm going to change them to

355
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:45,250
base64 at last i'm going to normalize it

356
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:50,899
so that i can't omit in a broadcasting

357
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:54,520
morse code the problem here is that i

358
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:57,650
cannot transmit it all because i have

359
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:02,930
uppercase lowercase characters i have

360
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:06,680
digits and that i have base64 alphabet

361
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:09,560
plus the slashes therefore what should

362
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:16,490
we do here well out of what we have Oh

363
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:21,250
out of what we don't have well we should

364
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:27,770
try to get it for that we can use

365
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:36,070
international Morse code and here we see

366
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:40,970
some punctuation marks some signs and

367
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:44,300
here we will normalize them so here when

368
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:47,300
we normalize we substitute when we want

369
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:51,440
to change from upper to lower the only

370
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:57,500
thing that we do is just to insert to a

371
00:25:51,440 --> 00:26:01,310
colon and last we will be transmitting

372
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:04,520
that so for instance if I find plus and

373
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:08,030
replace it with the minors or an

374
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:12,040
apostrophe as I needed to for an inter

375
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:14,680
file space so and that allows you to

376
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:21,120
play with all that

377
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,120
but because these would be quite complex

378
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,100
doing all that manually is quite complex

379
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:55,890
so we just built utility so this utility

380
00:26:51,520 --> 00:27:00,160
will generate tempests customized

381
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:05,800
tempests God here do you want to

382
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:07,780
generate a new tempest and these

383
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:13,600
Cybercom twenty sixteen thousand names

384
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:16,870
you give to it and it has generated the

385
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,290
RSA public key private key if I don't

386
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:24,520
trust these utility and if I want to

387
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:28,480
generate it with something else I take

388
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:32,410
my open SSL and automatically I paste it

389
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,680
here it's going to ask me about the file

390
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:41,230
or files that I want to take away with

391
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:51,700
me and this is well typical thing is a

392
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:54,310
DC / password and sometimes you need to

393
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,500
escalate privileges in the destination

394
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:59,649
machine because you cannot gain access

395
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:04,330
to some files therefore here we could

396
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:07,210
add some exploits and principal well the

397
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,520
exploit side do tests on sea but there

398
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:14,770
are some exploits there and because I

399
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:21,340
like this one or I copy and paste it

400
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:24,930
there then words per minute that you

401
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,929
want to transmit

402
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:31,989
and then the tone and then you can also

403
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:35,789
check polymorphic just in case there is

404
00:28:31,989 --> 00:28:38,469
some kind of detection because of the IV

405
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:42,789
we are following instructions of these

406
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:45,129
CPUs surely no antivirus will detect it

407
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:49,839
so once we have it we just click on

408
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:56,289
generate and then we get a tempest with

409
00:28:49,839 --> 00:29:01,349
an ID 68 nine maybe etc and here we'll

410
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:01,349
have some exploits that we could add

411
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:07,688
that's it and then disease we also have

412
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:11,099
that other hidden but that but that we

413
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:14,709
don't see now I'm take a look at the

414
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:26,249
tempest tossed have been generated this

415
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:26,249
is the last last cyber camp ATC + w d

416
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:34,089
and we will introduce number of

417
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:36,849
acceleration deceleration and then the

418
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:41,319
receiver takes a look at that and

419
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:43,509
manages that and he sees the frequency

420
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:49,239
of transmission weather has exploiting

421
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:51,099
it or not al Kia have the binaries I

422
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:54,309
have generated a tempest for Dave

423
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:57,279
remotely equipment then here I can take

424
00:29:54,309 --> 00:30:00,609
a look at what i did is step by step

425
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:04,089
what I did to encrypt the normal eyes of

426
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:05,918
the receiver the receiver is unique in

427
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:08,379
this case even if I generate this

428
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,779
tempest this tempest is unique for a

429
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:14,468
very simple reason because it can only

430
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:20,079
encode the signals that I have received

431
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:22,479
and it can only decrypt or decipher it

432
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:25,749
with these private key will have the

433
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:29,009
source code now and the source code upon

434
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:32,039
my apologies okay for well this is not a

435
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:35,740
good visualization well again we have a

436
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:39,370
better up to pass

437
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:44,679
I know that it has more code and our

438
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:48,459
will have is a base64 256 then

439
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:50,679
instructions and this is where I see it

440
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:57,670
hard coded I don't mind if the public

441
00:30:50,679 --> 00:31:00,580
key is hard-coded of the evil but the

442
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:05,710
evil guy that will be stealing things

443
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:08,909
from me so this is everything that goes

444
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:15,750
with it happen till it gets the file and

445
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:19,360
transmits it so these yoga voy hacer

446
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:22,690
para bajar me what I wanted is to go all

447
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:28,059
the way down and download the binary

448
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:32,170
files up and down and there you see the

449
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:33,520
tempest ID that has been allocated and

450
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:46,090
basically the only thing that needs to

451
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:48,040
be done this is it this is a binary I'll

452
00:31:46,090 --> 00:32:08,260
just grant running permits and

453
00:31:48,040 --> 00:32:10,600
privileges I'll run it this is now

454
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,570
broadcasting moves the whole file with

455
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,350
all variations everything that I've said

456
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:23,889
and can be intercepted anyone can come

457
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:26,250
in and intercept it what's in it well a

458
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,250
few things

459
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:34,369
the receiver will be the only one that

460
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:36,320
can get and receive right so what does

461
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:38,509
the receptor need a receiver need to do

462
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,989
well we would get the signal the

463
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:46,129
messages we would get it all and next

464
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:48,349
for you to see so that you understand

465
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:51,228
what's being emitted what's being

466
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:53,389
broadcasted I got this other one and

467
00:32:51,229 --> 00:33:06,320
I've got this one that this is for the

468
00:32:53,389 --> 00:33:10,309
receiver so this year has produced this

469
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,418
so thus produced a fine that is called

470
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:13,418
tempest MTX

471
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:23,150
regularly you don't see it but do you

472
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:26,209
see the search and replacements and

473
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:29,900
standardization of the file so there is

474
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:31,970
no mystery to it that is all and this is

475
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:37,429
what you are getting and would you're

476
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:39,289
broadcasting no problem here because

477
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:44,299
we've got all the time in the world so I

478
00:33:39,289 --> 00:34:00,820
will in broadcast it again and again and

479
00:33:44,299 --> 00:34:08,599
again these file goes out tempest out

480
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:14,259
and here bran invoking privileges I do

481
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:18,109
it step by step so that you follow so

482
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:21,139
the other one is silent so if we were to

483
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:28,449
place it or non-native rise different

484
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:31,070
silent but we need to follow it this is

485
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:35,810
can you hear it there is now is right

486
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:38,179
there is now is nice and when we rebuild

487
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:43,040
the signal it is good it is useful to

488
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:45,320
have this noise plus pts we don't have

489
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,290
someone speaking on background some some

490
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,690
some web broadcast in a station

491
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,849
broadcasting because they would all over

492
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:57,410
LA but then I get in filter it and I

493
00:34:52,849 --> 00:35:02,320
would get my own signal out this is what

494
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:02,319
i was saying this has produced a file

495
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:18,460
same here it's not actually because it

496
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:22,770
actually fits in different things so

497
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,770
this is a file now

498
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:43,370
906 what this tempest dust is well I

499
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,910
could have uploaded it and if we did

500
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:55,220
understand it this is what explain

501
00:35:45,910 --> 00:36:05,810
broadcast so it's all being broadcasted

502
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:08,149
right that's what swim I get it back and

503
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:11,420
when I get it back I see if it's two

504
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:17,270
dots i get to dot back i get i don't

505
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:24,110
know te whatever all of it it is just

506
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:26,630
the receptor the receiver sorry and what

507
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:31,220
do i need to do i just need to get it

508
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:35,030
place it there and it follows the same

509
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:40,879
steps reverse order getting everything

510
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:43,580
such as encryption keys etc and then

511
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:49,550
finally what do we find it would be a

512
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:51,799
fine the one we're interested in the

513
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:57,310
fine we should have expected out of

514
00:36:51,800 --> 00:37:03,830
these defines where we actually see here

515
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:08,450
then we managed to take away whatever i

516
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:11,870
say / asterisk several files were what

517
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:17,080
about so if you were intercepted in

518
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:17,080
between there's not much problem in it

519
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:30,390
well what is on what next

520
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:32,820
what do we want to do well there are few

521
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:36,170
things that have been done yes but

522
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:39,300
cannot be shared and I'm afraid that

523
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:45,350
would be a frequency that we could

524
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:48,000
choose we would also see what can

525
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:50,130
broadcast and receive because there's so

526
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,590
much band now is that we want to filter

527
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:55,290
we want to see high-powered directional

528
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,390
antenna because I know that you're

529
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:59,310
broadcasting from there and I get my

530
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:02,100
antenna here just a few meters away the

531
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,950
radio said is just nearby and so there

532
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:10,080
is only limited space and we know what's

533
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:13,560
the problem with Antony for example if

534
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:17,520
we want to start playing around with

535
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:24,720
different filters to reduce noise for

536
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:28,650
example with a software decoder that the

537
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:32,669
SDR so a sitcom goes in it's filtered we

538
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:35,310
could also use it the coders encoders

539
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:37,800
and decoders we can use something that

540
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:41,160
it's a bit more powerful we could have a

541
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,490
keel over when you're grabbing I place

542
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,740
the tempest in and every stroke you

543
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:50,189
every keystroke there's most

544
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:55,350
transmission or we can use a bad USB

545
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:58,980
attack or what if I'm so it seems it

546
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:05,100
seems that is been confirmed that this

547
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:08,330
Empress works does work and since we are

548
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:11,670
here at cyber camp I brought my own

549
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:16,279
click I hope you like it this is my

550
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,280
choreography these are the super trolls

551
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,209
name was he got no meals like I'm afraid

552
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,919
so this is a joke this is that yes it

553
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:33,980
seems that tempest it's been confirmed

554
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:39,200
and now time for questions if you have

555
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:49,940
any you aren't willing to applaud that

556
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:54,069
would be welcome if there are questions

557
00:39:49,940 --> 00:40:12,170
I seen nothing from here and blind it

558
00:39:54,070 --> 00:40:14,750
here I'm afraid I cannot hear you so

559
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:18,340
what if it were in a hot part of the

560
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:22,520
cage it would not work right actually

561
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:25,520
specs say that we need to use a Faraday

562
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,440
cage but what happens there well yes

563
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:32,060
there are shielding knows everything but

564
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:36,290
shielding Wallace not that good for cc I

565
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:39,410
and it is more secure it does much more

566
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:41,570
than in any other upside gadgets we

567
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:44,029
would use their of course their agencies

568
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:47,599
and people who say yes let's try denies

569
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:52,130
it massively all of it it's such as

570
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:55,099
things that had been tracked down and

571
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:59,300
there's been research and maybe there's

572
00:40:55,099 --> 00:41:03,220
been moved to Windows or Linux er anyway

573
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:05,660
and even there's been some research on

574
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:08,359
mobile phones to see to what extent

575
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,730
mobile phones can broadcast this way

576
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:17,630
remit to this wave this would be quite

577
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:20,180
simple visible side of the top of the

578
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:21,980
iceberg so to say I don't know how it

579
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,149
would work but if you are talented

580
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:28,580
enough you can see that we can discreet

581
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:30,410
increase speed we can broadcast into

582
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,690
quadrants and

583
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:34,879
so we would be broadcasting more things

584
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:37,280
and I live it there some people are

585
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:46,160
laughing their asses off here by the way

586
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:58,700
a few questions here I'm afraid they

587
00:41:46,160 --> 00:42:03,230
will not hear you Carlos asks maximum

588
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:06,859
distance for listening him I'll radius

589
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:11,270
it as simple as this a radio such as

590
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:16,369
simple as this you mean the villains so

591
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:19,730
agent so cartoon agents with an antenna

592
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:24,829
aiming I don't know eight meters it is

593
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:27,770
broadcasting but we know they know

594
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:33,079
better than us when it comes to to see

595
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:37,038
it they are very good at it distance I

596
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:41,809
don't know I find myself here inside a

597
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:44,480
Faraday cage without connection to

598
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:47,990
anything basically we would exchange

599
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:52,190
thins by writing them in a piece of

600
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:56,569
paper and there you go and we will meet

601
00:42:52,190 --> 00:43:06,170
for dinner at this time another question

602
00:42:56,569 --> 00:43:10,400
back there any tests for file reception

603
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:14,150
not just distract information yes yes of

604
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,579
course and I say so because they've

605
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:20,270
receiver kind of bring it out with me

606
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:24,200
but there is a series of receivers that

607
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:27,079
have a gadget similar to this one and we

608
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:29,960
just plays the binary into a device and

609
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:33,890
it's all dumped and you get the files no

610
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:39,380
problem it is not bi-directional that's

611
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:43,629
not so far I cannot get grab from the

612
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:46,150
receiver turn it into a mirror

613
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:48,010
or a broadcasting station because it's

614
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:56,010
about filtering information and we know

615
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:56,010
what we want to get over here

616
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:10,420
no not bi-directional but can you

617
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,779
reverse faces and you send something to

618
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:18,130
the CPU well it's way too risky you

619
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:21,310
could since it is harmonic with a nearby

620
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:25,510
device yes you can add some more scrap

621
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:28,690
into the CPU and we could screw the

622
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:31,869
transmission but problem is with the

623
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,910
device that it's a bit isolated how do

624
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:36,850
you get something in that's how to it

625
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:38,529
now and those devices dimmed you don't

626
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:42,100
usually make it out of the street for a

627
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:45,580
walk I mean cpu could interpret what do

628
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:47,650
we send them yes therefore any way we

629
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:51,609
would need first to understand what we

630
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:57,210
want and try to add something to it but

631
00:44:51,609 --> 00:45:00,580
it's to go in too fast the tests so far

632
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:03,010
proved that it's too fast and so we

633
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,950
cannot interfere and get something

634
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:09,760
visible out of it it'll be done for sure

635
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:13,149
i'll be done machine especially now in

636
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:21,900
you i'm sure that the villains will

637
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:26,020
manage if there are no more questions

638
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:29,140
thank you for your participation here at

639
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:31,259
cyber camp and see you later Thank of em

640
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,259
up
