1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:08,309
when I started this good afternoon thank

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,420
you all for your attendance and all the

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,959
people here or seen us on streaming and

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:19,020
thank you cyber camp for countin on me

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,689
this is me I've been introduced so it

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,220
won't take me long I'm still a student

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:30,359
so many people back there I get gene

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:32,579
there's a QR code explaining who I am if

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,989
you can scan it good for you and if not

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,420
it's not a bit lost so what I'm here to

11
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:44,099
discuss would have been industrial

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:48,539
environment ransomware as a concept real

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,270
cases affecting industrial environments

14
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,800
how the runs were impacts set the

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,770
environment attack development so then

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:04,199
we would step in the birds of this

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:11,760
criminal offenders yeah but people who

18
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:17,630
are here to to to hurt us and well a few

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,630
computer conclusions that we will take

20
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,500
so I like just plain what an industrial

21
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,920
network is large we have a corporate

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:33,079
network we all know it we have well

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:39,000
known protocols we have network printers

24
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:41,669
hard drives etc this is surveillance or

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,220
supervision we now move into the

26
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,430
industrial sector and then a control

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,520
network connected to a film network

28
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,899
which is fully industrial and different

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,329
protocols that they are these are the

30
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,060
industrial control systems the corporate

31
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,539
network would have an impact on the

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:06,750
supervision network and this is how it

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:10,590
is segmented protocols in within these

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:14,240
would be dnp3 marvels of well-known

35
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,910
heart and proprietary

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,210
protocol such as s7 romantic concept i

37
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,560
would like to mention is industrial

38
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,950
control systems on critical

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,670
infrastructures are these systems would

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:32,850
be a set of devices distributed at

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,359
different levels field control and

42
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,700
supervision levels as we've said before

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,220
connected within same network and that

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,220
can help us it managed physical

45
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:50,100
processes real time and then a critical

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:52,380
infrastructure a strategic element that

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,630
it's a paramount and gives no way to

48
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,720
alternative solutions meaning that i

49
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,820
have a water treatment plant a service

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,900
in madrid and then I have another one

51
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:08,130
service in a village it is not the same

52
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,830
it's not comparable if I lose the plant

53
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:14,850
that is service in Madrid compared to

54
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:17,940
another one service in the village it

55
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:22,109
would be much more critical the one in

56
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:24,390
Madrid same way the infrastructure

57
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:30,780
protection institute has a catalogue at

58
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:35,100
least were they wisely they comment each

59
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,310
company that they might be owners of a

60
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:43,109
critical infrastructure past these two

61
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:47,160
concepts we move on to critical

62
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,670
infrastructures right what are these

63
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,650
strategic sectors here we've got energy

64
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,829
water foot health transportation

65
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,989
chemical industry etc so no need for me

66
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,600
to read it right you can you can read it

67
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,010
yourselves and what about runs on oil

68
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,100
what's one some lawyer it is malware

69
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,450
whose purpose is to limit access to

70
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,959
parts of the systems that we have

71
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:16,709
available in our on our computers it

72
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:20,548
usually comes with a rumson that is

73
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,970
requested by the offenders it's all

74
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:26,370
about money and based on the system that

75
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,130
is affected and they asked for more or

76
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:34,110
less money usually in

77
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:36,570
so kinds of ransomware Locker one

78
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:43,910
somewhere that it's a device lock in and

79
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:50,030
then as of late there are others that

80
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:50,030
affect the Master Boot Record

81
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:55,650
differences between information

82
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,700
technology and operation technology how

83
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,620
does from summer effect at both kind of

84
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,409
environment for information

85
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,220
technologists there is a permanent data

86
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:11,040
encryption both corporate and personal

87
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:13,800
so I guess you all have some device that

88
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:18,770
you take to work so that's the

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:22,980
bring-your-own-device idea so this

90
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:26,450
network device network device encryption

91
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:29,580
printers and corporate systems

92
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:33,479
dissemination of information in restore

93
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:36,750
it restoring attempts now we refer to

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:40,890
content that it deciphered that content

95
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:44,520
is really revealed or released or some

96
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:48,659
other kind of malfeasance our attack if

97
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:52,049
a random word affect the supervision

98
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,930
network mainly there is a malfunctioning

99
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,510
of the devices which in turn causes

100
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:01,770
problems for the plant employee years

101
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:03,419
the idle times are critical and in

102
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:07,289
industry what matters is availability

103
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:10,140
that's what matters the most so having

104
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:13,919
to stop it it is very important because

105
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,960
it creates a lots of money last another

106
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,330
spread of information there's a mini

107
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,000
something for mation in significant

108
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:23,789
formation I have this part and I'm

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,490
setting myself apart because I have this

110
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,080
part which I find T into the to such an

111
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,740
extent the damn the only one producing

112
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,370
it if the information says the line I

113
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:38,880
will lose my a bulk business park so it

114
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,529
is quite quite delicate real cases for

115
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,979
ransomware

116
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:49,859
this one allen-bradley simulating a

117
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:54,329
framework that the producer had the

118
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:58,739
operator gets it it it's not updated do

119
00:06:54,329 --> 00:07:01,319
you want to update your device it goes

120
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:03,748
into the website to download it and it

121
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:09,329
came with a little present with random

122
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:14,819
where this is a search on Soudan which

123
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:17,879
is a engine that you might know these

124
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:21,359
are online devices there are a few more

125
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:25,009
right I will explain that later on but

126
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:28,198
for a small search of these very

127
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:30,919
manufacturer Spain ranks third this is

128
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:35,839
very important for what we said before

129
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:39,539
idle times for production are paramount

130
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:43,019
then this this call quite clear it was

131
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:48,839
act over 2015 and this is sebelum that

132
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:53,039
the company specialized in see streams

133
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,689
this is a turbine turbine in deep in the

134
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,169
sea it's difficult to put it in and to

135
00:07:54,689 --> 00:08:00,589
take it out as well and the attackers

136
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:05,008
took control over the supervision

137
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:10,009
computer no need to go into the field

138
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:10,009
network no need to go all the way end

139
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,248
just by using ransomware on the

140
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,709
supervision layer it causes lots of

141
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:22,229
problems it was found that they were

142
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:25,439
using crypto Locker and it took them two

143
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:28,109
weeks to restart the turbine and the

144
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:33,870
attackers as it's been said before asked

145
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:36,718
for four thousand dollars so the d700

146
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,688
diras not Matt railing it took some two

147
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,620
weeks so two weeks of idle time for the

148
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:47,490
turbines to Matt this another example

149
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,930
februari 26 2006 the Hollywood

150
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,410
Presbyterian Medical Center in Hollywood

151
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:58,029
had another infection this is a locking

152
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:03,110
family infection the ransom was paid

153
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:05,210
9000 bitcoins 3 million euros the

154
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,360
infection came from some mattress that

155
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:14,570
they've had been enabled by employees

156
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:18,110
and well since they were on laid went in

157
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:22,190
and cast disturbances to patients that

158
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:25,760
had to be moved elsewhere so it is quite

159
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:31,070
quite difficult februari 2016 German

160
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:35,149
hospitals three or so there was a

161
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:37,430
blackout of service and they didn't pay

162
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:40,730
because German word in intelligent and

163
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:43,130
used their backups to reset systems same

164
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:51,520
way when you have random where you have

165
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:55,670
some time to activate and fight it back

166
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:59,360
and it takes you to some time and it

167
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,640
ruins in and this is the last one last

168
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,250
Saturday it was San Francisco

169
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,949
underground system over two thousand

170
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,540
computers were compromised as part of

171
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,300
San Francisco transportation system I

172
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,400
don't know if you've read about it but

173
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:18,079
100 bitcoins were asked as ransom that

174
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:21,620
is the 73 thousand dollars and fled more

175
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,320
than 65,000 years it was not paid and it

176
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:29,240
took them two days or so to get it all

177
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,850
back in working and you see two free

178
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,029
days for transportation because the

179
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:41,300
boxes for the tickets were not working

180
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:44,420
properly and they decided that people

181
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:48,859
should use the service even if free of

182
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:52,699
charge and that was the message by the

183
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,260
ransomware friend saying that data had

184
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,980
been encrypted and that they should

185
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,980
contact him

186
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:02,809
so let's put our self initiatives of a

187
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:10,089
walk in the truth of anataka of the

188
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:13,910
crook lon free admission attack

189
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:16,160
development attack vectors spreading off

190
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,929
the attack and then explained those are

191
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,939
the highlights I wanted to bring here's

192
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:25,129
and the last one is about getting money

193
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:27,170
so these are the stages attack

194
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:29,720
development what do we need first who

195
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:34,759
are we going to attack we attack our

196
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:41,209
target and we find information on the

197
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:46,100
company we use our in abbenay depending

198
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:48,439
on where our target is located we'll

199
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,939
keep searching flow chart as well it's

200
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:55,189
not the same attacking a CEO or an

201
00:11:51,939 --> 00:12:00,170
employee privileges are not the same

202
00:11:55,189 --> 00:12:02,809
both on the network or higher key within

203
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:08,689
the company and services Fanning this is

204
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:11,420
n map we use the tool we choose so same

205
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:18,259
as the bad guys you can use your own

206
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:20,329
scripts on em map no good it can be it

207
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:25,490
can manage to stop and infrastructures

208
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:31,239
not good our P table queries find out

209
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:33,259
the devices is you know it's not good

210
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:39,319
devices on software two years what

211
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:41,720
models what devices the ones that I with

212
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:44,628
target years for which we can use soda

213
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,600
so then ohtsu mine which is the Chinese

214
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:50,540
version it's quite good Francis is

215
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,749
another engine that you might be more

216
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:57,279
familiar with where you can also search

217
00:12:53,749 --> 00:13:00,860
for devices available on the Internet

218
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,860
communications available so we can see

219
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,220
the product of three years in and

220
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,869
programs as well as over there using if

221
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,660
we're going to inject our have a

222
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:14,180
JavaScript and obfuscate it on a PDF

223
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:18,949
we can check out the PDF Reader they use

224
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:23,380
Adobe Reader whatever and maybe they use

225
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:27,440
an office word or excel or word word or

226
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:31,520
macros as we said before companies they

227
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,950
work with no need to attack our target

228
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:38,360
maybe a third party should be attack and

229
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:42,530
they would introduce inject our warm our

230
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,140
malware we can use that knowledge on the

231
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,300
internet and see what companies are

232
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,540
working with our target and infect this

233
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:53,750
company instead and once they move into

234
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,459
maintenance or support and go into

235
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:58,420
networks that are not accessible from

236
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,580
the internet they can plug a USB and USB

237
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:04,939
or take their own computer for

238
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:08,150
maintenance or a VPN connection it's all

239
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:11,360
about elaborating it on it and these

240
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:13,520
days the attack production will it be a

241
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,540
run somewhere a crypt to run somewhere

242
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:20,090
just some data do we lock the devices

243
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:24,890
and take it all down depending on what

244
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:29,150
we want so complexity can be higher or

245
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:32,000
lower attack vectors so socially

246
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,250
engineering nowadays almost every attack

247
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,200
we have have social engineering there

248
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,790
are only a few without and were you

249
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,510
socially engineering together with

250
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:45,560
mobile devices that we can infect and

251
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:50,060
and and enter into our target fishing

252
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:54,489
whether it is redirecting the target to

253
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:58,430
our servers or using macros and

254
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:00,830
JavaScript on a PDF or use this infected

255
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:04,219
us best i think it was early in the

256
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:08,600
morning that stack snacked was explained

257
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:11,060
and it used usps and you are cute i

258
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,940
wanted to mention it because there many

259
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,180
producers nowadays that are using these

260
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,520
QR codes in their devices and it is

261
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,130
difficult because it's very elaborate to

262
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,840
do to have a QR code change but if i'm

263
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,910
not mistaken there was a clear example

264
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,990
from a company that was a ketchup

265
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:34,410
ketchup manufacturing using QR codes on

266
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:39,210
the bottle and there was one redirecting

267
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:45,060
to hotter websites how to infect a

268
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:49,260
victim spreading next so marching we are

269
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,869
the crook one up on the cloud and we

270
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,600
infect the network first save there is a

271
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:59,880
backbone so there's lots of segmentation

272
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:03,650
here often companies are not so nicely

273
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,060
segmented right they are you selling out

274
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:10,290
so we would have access to the corporate

275
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,270
network which would have printers and

276
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,610
files that are all app in the network

277
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:17,220
and other devices that are to be found

278
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,540
on there and so if there is from

279
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,660
somewhere and we don't have the right

280
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,689
measures a there is infection what then

281
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:27,870
we will try to propagate to spread 25

282
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:30,920
watt to circumvent we will skip the

283
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,940
supervision and go up to the operator

284
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,949
that's what's interesting they would

285
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:38,550
lose their communication and same as

286
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:40,260
with Sabella's Rios case the there's no

287
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,699
communication with the operator station

288
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:45,290
with the workstation on the operator can

289
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,290
not communicate anymore with the turbine

290
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:55,110
unstable network as a consequence

291
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:57,930
exploits what then when the ransomware

292
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,760
is exploited what happens to companies

293
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:04,679
so there is a loss of their brand

294
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:12,980
perception so they've been attacked by

295
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:12,980
Ram somewhere in production idol x and

296
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:20,448
in industry availability is the most

297
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:23,930
important in if a production is to be

298
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:27,079
stopped bad news environmental problems

299
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:31,010
personal damages may be a PI blurbs up

300
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:36,169
maybe a tank blokes blows up orelsan

301
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:40,460
something even worse environmental

302
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:47,390
problems and also injuries and monetary

303
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:52,550
lost lots of money can be lost I wanted

304
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:57,100
to run a demo here then see this is a

305
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:59,178
Raspberry Pi screen and this is it hm I

306
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,610
local one when there isn't it next

307
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:13,280
there's another one cell phone mouse and

308
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:16,070
you have it it is Matt drink here comes

309
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,740
in demo hope so well it's not moving

310
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,550
doesn't matter well there it is staking

311
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,550
its through time

312
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:44,940
good stop it there good not not not good

313
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:50,730
not a good idea I can play it like this

314
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:55,260
you can see it right there is a local

315
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:57,840
hmm I of the whole process here this is

316
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,960
a refinery plant it has its down tank

317
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,870
and down there you see the fluid coming

318
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,960
from the refinery and next to it there

319
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:10,678
is a balance room and then an output

320
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,200
valve up of several forms at first it's

321
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:19,860
all very nice it looks great and we will

322
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:21,780
try to go into this plants right let's

323
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:27,928
hope it changes and we will see the

324
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:31,800
process how we can go in and we'll use Q

325
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:35,429
R as a vector the one I mentioned it is

326
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,889
quite complex but it could happen it is

327
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:40,320
complex the same as we do SB but it it

328
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:45,960
can go in so this is the infected QR

329
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:50,580
code we've put it into the local ATM I

330
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:53,700
shell where pressure could be read and I

331
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:59,189
mean the pipe pressure we start the

332
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:02,340
rubberized item will scan the code which

333
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:06,600
will read directors to a server that is

334
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:09,449
infected with a PDF Karen a surprise

335
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:15,530
package you cannot really see it bad

336
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,530
well it's there good

337
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,408
so we've worked on it for the operator

338
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,590
to see that everything is perfect

339
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:29,919
otherwise they will crash me they

340
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:32,619
download it and the operator says I will

341
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,649
not read it on my PDA why I should read

342
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:40,689
it on my computer for sure so after the

343
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:46,928
computer to read the PDF this is the

344
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:52,019
operator wise person so as their wish

345
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:55,539
for it they open it and in fact it is

346
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:59,200
there is JavaScript inside the PDF that

347
00:20:55,539 --> 00:21:02,109
it is run executed as the operator opens

348
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,419
it it'll be infected in fact it and you

349
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:05,559
would say why is not real around

350
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:12,159
somewhere but it was my home network

351
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:14,200
said same example but am d or attending

352
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,690
off the javascript disabled in

353
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,249
JavaScript so we open it up and that's

354
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:24,460
magic nothing happens one of the

355
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:30,730
conclusions we can come to is disabled

356
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:33,519
javascript I guess many of us used to

357
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:40,049
have it on me included and we need to be

358
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:40,049
careful I've just the PDF stream dumper

359
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:51,879
this is for JavaScript malware analysis

360
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:59,109
PDF analysis specifically these are true

361
00:21:51,879 --> 00:22:03,309
box and this is the code that could be

362
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:07,570
inside the infected piercing as you can

363
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:09,908
see this local H M I was checking ridden

364
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,809
pressures it's gone black gone crazy and

365
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:17,399
you might not be able to sit it see it

366
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:20,590
but I try to you in hey Syd later on

367
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:23,199
this is the global process and how it

368
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:26,370
goes idle

369
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:33,460
and it moves all the material and

370
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:37,870
receiver valves are off and supposition

371
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:40,480
moving goes crazy so to say it is

372
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,639
unstable now and we see it opening and

373
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,230
closing over and over again see

374
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:51,250
operators of going to panic the dam is

375
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:54,789
not working what should i do so malware

376
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:59,139
again we need to let them know to send a

377
00:22:54,789 --> 00:23:02,408
warning and d infect it so valve opens

378
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:06,449
but closes and opens and closes down so

379
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:06,450
the system is fully unstable

380
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:27,190
as you've seen this that was merciful

381
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:31,809
some some conclusions now message volume

382
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:35,740
based on tech time we see malware

383
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:38,860
attached and malicious urls especially

384
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:44,830
javascript if the javascript is the most

385
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:46,779
used one right and EXO and what macros

386
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,480
are used now but PDFs are so very

387
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:52,510
interesting because by default such as

388
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:56,760
faucet or Adobe Reader have the

389
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,760
JavaScript on and we need to turn it off

390
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,510
other conclusion some best practices we

391
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:06,039
need to raise awareness amounts our

392
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:10,000
employees yes then civilization it is

393
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:12,158
important then proper segmentation it's

394
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,710
no point in having the best firewall or

395
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:21,010
IPS in the market if is not properly set

396
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:24,429
up macro activation using anti

397
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:26,200
ransomware tools you have it from

398
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,779
different companies working under need

399
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,200
they have different solutions and you

400
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:34,720
can choose whatever you want but you

401
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,159
need to keep an eye on it disabling Java

402
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,080
Script as you seem is quite quite

403
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:44,169
important then dhara or standards

404
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:48,220
compromise lyst backups mainly backups

405
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:52,960
it'll take us time to reset it to

406
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:57,340
restore it but we would manage it these

407
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,230
are two documents the first one on run

408
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,510
somewhere and best practices in case

409
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:04,929
you're interested in more info the other

410
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:08,980
one is from desert like your photography

411
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:10,510
Center discussin runs more security

412
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:15,820
measures quite interesting us wrong and

413
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:20,279
an industry well not everything is

414
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:23,620
available in insuk tools I've used

415
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:25,539
unfortunately I could not develop

416
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,668
anything and I've used projects from

417
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:30,908
people who well I really appreciate that

418
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:33,159
they did it on github and this is the

419
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:39,429
process hm I

420
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:41,830
Global the local HMI this is a one for

421
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:43,479
the PDF damper and then run somewhere

422
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,210
analysis if you are into malware

423
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:48,190
analysis here you see in a series of

424
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,249
URLs that are quite quite interesting

425
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,710
you might be familiar with them and well

426
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:57,159
and if so once you've been infected with

427
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,749
ransomware once it's been i've loaded

428
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:00,279
what kind of ransomware you said we need

429
00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:02,889
to know what family is there are so many

430
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:06,879
families now on run somewhere unless you

431
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:08,320
check out the extension or is that if a

432
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:13,719
specific saying you will not find out

433
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:16,629
and this is the IOT you know so now we

434
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:19,659
have ransomware and we'll all go cressey

435
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:21,488
even the vacuum cleaner we can get

436
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:28,179
ransomware it seems this is a real case

437
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:30,309
this is smart thermostat and this one

438
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:33,190
person had the brightest VD and the

439
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:36,668
world and said what about a ransomware

440
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:39,700
for a smart thermostat well yes let's

441
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:42,669
try it ask for one Bitcoin in exchange

442
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:47,039
for control and otherwise it would turn

443
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:50,109
up the temperature as plain as that and

444
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,090
I rushed through it I have plenty of

445
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,299
time left so thank you very much to all

446
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,299
of you

447
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:11,049
what SI tienes alguna pregunta if there

448
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:13,420
are questions oh no David are not any if

449
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:16,059
there's no question no problem we'll go

450
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:23,170
break for dinner I hope you liked it I

451
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:25,149
ever kept you entertained so good

452
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:28,330
evening thank you very much you've

453
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,690
mentioned this program PDF something

454
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:36,389
dumper I'm sorry I could not take note

455
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:36,390
we've got 20 minutes left darn you worry

456
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,168
no problem

457
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,690
yes i'll try to upload the presentation

458
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,110
wherever so that you have the references

459
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:55,100
I got URLs under the real cases so that

460
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:57,659
you can look into it further I've not

461
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,939
elaborated and it did not elaborate on

462
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:03,360
it because I wanted it to be light maybe

463
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:05,070
two lies and I excelled at eight but I

464
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,780
wanted people to have funds they wanted

465
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:09,060
people to understand the concept I

466
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:13,800
wanted people to see how important it is

467
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:15,450
to defend systems to corporates networks

468
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,280
are important friend but industrial

469
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,290
control systems and critical

470
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,010
infrastructure systems are very very

471
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:28,530
important because of the problems they

472
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:31,860
might entail give me a minute good good

473
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:39,870
good good there it goes there you have

474
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:40,979
it that's it I live it on there might be

475
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,590
the most interesting design that I

476
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,980
brought thank you very much not at all

477
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,980
thank you

478
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,220
when SI lo primero de la laa good

479
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,750
evening thank you for your presentation

480
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:18,390
thank you for enduring it I wanted to

481
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:22,420
know do you know about Saudi Aramco

482
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:24,520
skates back in twenty twelve affecting

483
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:30,840
its whole infrastructure it is a petrol

484
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:30,840
company and they had to go back to cable

485
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:37,660
why do they do so and I said should not

486
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,429
be done because it might be too much and

487
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:43,240
you need to take some measures those

488
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:45,250
were servers and I don't know if they

489
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,700
affected the control area or not I don't

490
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,850
really know but since they are servers

491
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,470
are not communicated with control area

492
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:55,570
maybe they had no interaction with

493
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,660
industrial side and so they go could use

494
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,928
cable but often you need to take some

495
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:05,950
measures and that's all you have because

496
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:09,120
losses would be great greater than if

497
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:11,920
you didn't use cable but within

498
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,550
industrial network you could not go back

499
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:19,300
to cable to wire at a corporate level as

500
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:22,510
we are used to you could go back to

501
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:27,580
cable and this is way too critical to

502
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:30,280
you on your business and based on the

503
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,559
latest attacks with ransomware what

504
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,860
measures are being taken by companies

505
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,340
apart from their physical back backups

506
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:41,219
yes backups mainly we all know that

507
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:44,350
attackers are always a step ahead of us

508
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:49,120
they've got plenty of time to plan it

509
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:53,500
and they're very elaborate attacks but

510
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:56,800
you do not expect so trying to defend

511
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:00,300
yourself it tense turns out to be much

512
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:04,990
more complex but you can use a firewall

513
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:09,190
you can use jarrah standards rules you

514
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:13,760
can see compromise indicators other ram

515
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:16,400
summer programs update your database

516
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,270
servers that are infected to cut them

517
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:23,990
out cut out all communication so your

518
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:25,970
bulk is in Spain but your company's only

519
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:29,930
Spanish and you've got communication

520
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:31,430
with other countries it's not normal you

521
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:35,000
should only have communications in Spain

522
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:40,490
throughout Spain that would be you need

523
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:43,430
to go in deeper vandy attacker but it is

524
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:46,370
true attacks such as a Stuxnet you don't

525
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:50,540
expect them there will be an operator

526
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:54,340
with a USB having 40 days and they get

527
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:57,139
Ewing a big mess this is unexpected but

528
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:00,139
try to set up as many measures as

529
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:04,420
possible and awareness about fishing for

530
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:07,460
your employees who might not be aware

531
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:13,760
and people who aren't aware and yet they

532
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:17,470
need to be careful we could all fall to

533
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,470
these kind of tricks thank you very much

534
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:27,189
mano a que lo hacen in pokemon i would

535
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:29,720
have forgotten hola hola watches yeah

536
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,970
hello I'd like to ask you about all

537
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:40,460
these cases did you have information

538
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:42,500
about cases that were not reported by

539
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:47,300
the company i understand that companies

540
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:53,780
do not really want to disclose it yes I

541
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:57,590
know what you mean there is a regulation

542
00:32:53,780 --> 00:33:00,879
and the way and it is a European

543
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:03,709
regulation for sharing insolent the

544
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,810
regulation would make it in kind of

545
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,990
mandatory for companies to share

546
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:10,790
incidents it is true to say that each

547
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:12,470
companies have followed their own

548
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,560
methodology when it comes to

549
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:18,520
communicating incident reporting that to

550
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,590
the national certs this is a bit tricky

551
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,840
sharing my incident yes or no if you

552
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:27,500
share your incidents as we said before

553
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,720
you may you can expect this type of

554
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:32,990
attacks that is to say like a very

555
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:36,290
crafty attack that you can learn enough

556
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:39,830
from so it is very important that

557
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:41,570
companies share that so that those

558
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:44,960
companies that have not been attacked

559
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:47,830
learned from those being attacked and as

560
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,410
I say well this is a very

561
00:33:47,830 --> 00:34:02,710
company-specific okay depends on each

562
00:33:50,410 --> 00:34:02,710
company thank you very much
