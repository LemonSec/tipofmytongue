need to thank you that you're here if

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,049

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,859
is it here what am I to discuss today

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:24,090
well I work now with young people who

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:29,039
are 19 24 27 and opt for a professional

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:31,529
career and and they've talked they asked

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,550
me to say how to employ to improve your

9
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:40,680
employability and or not just or but add

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,360
or lead your own company there are

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,850
different types of people in the world

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,640
but we will focus on to those looking

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,289
for Europe and those who actually want

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:56,719
to run their own company I hope you good

15
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:59,250
I i wish i would have google or facebook

16
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,649
because that's important as well as a

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,420
country as a nation state and for

18
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,390
personal development because i know very

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,970
talented people let's not forget that

20
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,130
these two people the one looking for an

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,400
employment that they find satisfactory

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,770
and the Japanese are complementary we

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,930
cannot have large companies with that

24
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,780
wonderful employees and the other way

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,490
around great employees need great

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,220
companies where they can first develop

27
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,259
themselves and be something a good

28
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,270
company is the one that helps their

29
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,979
employees become happier and happier

30
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,530
every day it's not just money everything

31
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,600
is necessary here if a company helps

32
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,619
their people its own people grow that's

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:44,130
paramount what is employability why is

34
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:47,070
it so difficult to find good jobs why do

35
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,860
we need to work on it London a good job

36
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,939
and how can we get better to achieve our

37
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,159
targets as these things well I've been

38
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,039
good art that's why I've been brought

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,820
here to explain that to those who

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,040
against who want to get some orientation

41
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:09,090
so what's employability it would be

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,120
something like the capability to to

43
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,100
present yourself nicely to an employer

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,950
so

45
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:20,390
not as its how brilliant you are how

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:23,899
much you know but opening up to smart as

47
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:27,019
it is called which is a job vacancy and

48
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:30,080
somehow sadir's with your personality

49
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,570
your background knowledge and then land

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,780
the jump and if you're doing so it's

51
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,970
because you need it because you want it

52
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:43,580
we will not accept a job that is not for

53
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:47,270
us that would be employed bulleting and

54
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:51,260
I like this that it helps you helps you

55
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,610
as a person so that if you fulfilled so

56
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,120
if you're going to spend eight hours a

57
00:02:52,610 --> 00:03:01,480
day when you get home it's not due to

58
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:06,380
yell are your kids it needs to help you

59
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,060
feel fulfilled and how is why is it so

60
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,130
difficult to find these jobs because

61
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,860
maybe they do not exist good jobs right

62
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,890
and this is something that when they say

63
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,620
all old job some sim prep right maybe we

64
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:21,859
haven't searched well enough for that

65
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:25,010
very good job because think of the

66
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:32,210
following ninety percent of all people

67
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:34,310
work for someone else but you have a

68
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,200
powerful visionary it seems that they

69
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,920
all need to be entrepreneurs and

70
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:44,899
companies and so Germany had a visionary

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,250
with power back in 36 Adolf Hitler so

72
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,160
that's what we're seeing a visionary

73
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,780
with power and this is not that ninety

74
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,079
percent of all people work for someone

75
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,820
else and then there are some people said

76
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,740
in apps that in app companies but we

77
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,410
cannot have ninety percent startup so

78
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,460
who else would work Chinese people they

79
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,460
are so dangerous you know

80
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:15,369
but we lack the context the context the

81
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:19,949
contextual vision so this is kind of a

82
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,780
board game board you need to be in there

83
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:26,560
what's around me what's offered to you

84
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,840
but it's not so trivial and I've seen

85
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,790
the newsletters and the world is

86
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,888
a 15 inch or a centimeter high screen

87
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:39,220
and they spend their day like that and

88
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,080
they admire each other they deserve you

89
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,460
know give a blow to each other I don't

90
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:49,150
know that lives in your context and you

91
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,948
don't really have a context of Ed of

92
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,560
where you are or where you're moving and

93
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:56,080
that is paramount we don't know how to

94
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,199
add value to ourselves our enriquez edit

95
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,020
their very brilliant people and it seems

96
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,330
that I didn't value to yourself showing

97
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,609
your value it's seen well if I'm good at

98
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,440
something anytime visibility and I'm

99
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,570
gonna have a degree and the way to

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,030
compensate for it or well I'll explain

101
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:16,960
that later you need to have your own

102
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:21,638
profile your your your place i'm on

103
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,549
google 60,000 is Vance can come to add

104
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:27,160
water not having a degree could mean but

105
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:32,320
do you need to give volley to yourself

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:35,169
and tony i have this invention but i

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,659
don't say it aloud in case it gets

108
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:42,490
stolen if i had a hammer I would hit

109
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:44,770
them what's the point of an invention he

110
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,599
was gonna cop it from you because the

111
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,460
worms on was been fully invented you

112
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:51,240
need to share you need to add value to

113
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:54,190
those things you've harmed you at home

114
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,660
just saying it to me when it seems that

115
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,680
your treasure is gonna get stolen say a

116
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:06,130
load of the beans what was the name of

117
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:10,630
that thing a Smeagol and we over value

118
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:12,820
ourselves so I don't bloom cuz you've

119
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,250
done something you've been on a blog

120
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,880
whatever and you think you're God

121
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,880
yourself

122
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:27,410
I am huge you're no one you're a nobody

123
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,870
have you invented the Apes vaccine so

124
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,760
what have we done anything special how

125
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,650
do you save high five hundred million

126
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:41,120
people in the world no you're not so

127
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:43,520
special you know things because you lose

128
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,260
your mind and I've seen it you get a

129
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,580
call because they're you've invented a

130
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,080
tool and you think you've done something

131
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:53,990
but actually not do you have this mmm

132
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:58,219
tiny second of fame and you value

133
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:00,890
yourself modesty humility you might find

134
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,630
these people who are too full of

135
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:06,979
themselves it seems that it's like

136
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:09,380
getting a date with Obama mr. Obama but

137
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:14,450
the world is full of it is morons and

138
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:16,340
yet we need to deal with them while I

139
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,440
should we work on it we need to really

140
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,950
understand that it we wanna leave Leave

141
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,140
in means paying bills and account that's

142
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:30,050
leaving in a society we might like

143
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:34,250
better or worse so this is important yes

144
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:37,940
we cannot leave a home with mum and dad

145
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:42,919
until we have 41 and some of you are

146
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:45,919
close to a shrine we need to work on

147
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,320
that and it's unfortunate I've know if

148
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,669
lift some sixteen countries or song and

149
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:57,430
I'm surprised that there are 37 year old

150
00:07:51,669 --> 00:08:01,400
people 37 who would have been at war

151
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:04,910
being sent abroad to war years ago they

152
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,940
still with their parents so what's going

153
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,730
to come to you we do you get an

154
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,500
independent life when you are 55 when

155
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,630
you're about to get your retirement

156
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,780
pension them stay with your depth that

157
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:21,380
amount forever so you are lucky because

158
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,809
you live in a society that is flexible

159
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,719
given you opportunities given you

160
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:30,110
opportunities you might think not but it

161
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,760
it has and so try and use it leave your

162
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:38,909
all means and build your own

163
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:41,600
pathway we need to believe our lives how

164
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:44,910
can we get better to achieve our targets

165
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,280
this is no magic trick this is his

166
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,870
common sense of us with anything else in

167
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:54,390
life engineer it comes from ingenious it

168
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,340
is common sense it's off things because

169
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,439
you follow your common sense five steps

170
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,560
as part of your passion that its

171
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:06,120
cybersecurity or I a computer security

172
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:09,089
just use five sensible steps prove your

173
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,190
training yes we need to be able to prove

174
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:14,490
it to some extent university is

175
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:16,560
important I find it very important but

176
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,790
the university needs to go through you

177
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,589
and not you through university because

178
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,030
here you just get a piece of paper at

179
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,610
the end and after going through

180
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,770
University it doesn't work like this it

181
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,870
is important at some point to question

182
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:36,090
and not now that we need to have a

183
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,250
degree a higher degree because you like

184
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,800
it that's your training and you need to

185
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:44,640
be able to prove it we need to be fully

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,290
trained truly trained qualified meaning

187
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,330
anything you've published or

188
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,849
presentations and speeches given at a

189
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,290
conference that's part of your

190
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:59,150
qualification part of your person and

191
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:01,709
Brigid Gonzalez not Serena Gonzalez

192
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,530
working on your profile and add

193
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:07,860
visibility to it yes I don't want to

194
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:11,400
talk about linked and well I'm on no

195
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:16,440
social medium but those tools initially

196
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:19,310
neatly used are to be used and we need

197
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,390
to have those nice profile so people say

198
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,810
what they think people think differently

199
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:27,449
from us they see the fish aid before the

200
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,390
human potential under is believed you

201
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,430
don't give them the fish aid to defer

202
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,750
shot you know the human potential you

203
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,689
want to get there and you need to work

204
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,130
on that by the time you get a status

205
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:43,730
gone off super sayan

206
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:47,589
then you can delete your LinkedIn and

207
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:54,680
Twitter accounts because doesn't matter

208
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:56,690
work work on your social skills having

209
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,550
social skills actually we were at

210
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,620
networking yesterday it is paramount to

211
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:04,000
have the social skills visual eye

212
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:09,880
contact I cannot speak like this I'm a

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,880
Virginia this is Raymond in front of me

214
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:16,399
it's so simple and it's important that

215
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,880
when you express something look people

216
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,070
in their faces to their let me into the

217
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,740
i vas a then it's difficult but that's

218
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,200
the way that you express yourself i and

219
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,930
this is my love Ramona's t-shirt hey you

220
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,120
rock and roll here you go but but it is

221
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,219
important that you have that eye contact

222
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,709
because it breaks down distances and

223
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:41,959
thistle can be trained it can be trained

224
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:43,399
no need to add to go a high level but

225
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,119
you pay attention to people who are good

226
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,380
at it to try to have role played and

227
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,140
this is good because your technical

228
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:55,370
skill sometimes ninety-five percent of

229
00:11:51,140 --> 00:12:00,770
all times I reversely proportional to

230
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:04,310
social skills right so we need to boost

231
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:08,360
it as part of this do not be arrogant

232
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:10,040
but do not be more'n either I do things

233
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,130
that you're very interesting things I'm

234
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,140
good at selling but if you're Morin you

235
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,939
are ruled out immediately first because

236
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:21,920
you've seen as a as a threat or because

237
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:25,640
they realized their mom so do not be our

238
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,319
grant full of yourself yes but yeah and

239
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,839
you need to know how to communicate I do

240
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,470
this because I love it because I'm good

241
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,230
at it I'm worth it but do not move on to

242
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,630
being full of yourself yes no that

243
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,480
doesn't work in the short term it can

244
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:45,579
bring you some results but you know in

245
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:49,579
the meat long term we all find our

246
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:52,859
position in life know how to ask for

247
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:55,989
something if you're doing something good

248
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,730
you know you might say ah nothing below

249
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,829
eighty thousand I well below in two

250
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,930
thousand want to give you is trash I do

251
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:05,109
not accept I do not get out of bed for

252
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,939
less than 80,000 or egg this and you

253
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,889
need to know how to ask for something

254
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:11,110
when you go to a job interview the ideas

255
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:14,709
how much I'm going to be paid in Spain

256
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:19,449
there is not capitalism but Spanish and

257
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:21,339
I'll listen quite the country solutions

258
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:28,719
such as how much do you want to make

259
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:31,629
that's that's what they reply as much as

260
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:37,449
possible that can be given that's what

261
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:39,250
I'm here for but you decide so you throw

262
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:41,889
the ball back I'm here to make money to

263
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:46,660
make as much money as I can but it's

264
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:48,250
also up to you to to design and so this

265
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,420
video is made you need to know how to

266
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:54,910
ask for it and it before we leave the

267
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,800
company betray the company we want to

268
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,439
ask for something you can talk to your

269
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,019
boss and say this is me I want to leave

270
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:04,059
it I will get more money elsewhere but I

271
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:06,819
love this so i would like to ask you to

272
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:08,500
change this in any possible way i don't

273
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:14,110
want to be a stakeholder it just need a

274
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:18,009
raise and what about this oh my god oh

275
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:22,170
my god these is what we miss here what

276
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:27,850
we need to do in in spain learn english

277
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:33,009
not gentle ret window I'm Way too old

278
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:36,009
for this but honestly the potential that

279
00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:38,230
you get out of english in life I

280
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:41,920
wouldn't have traveled to so many places

281
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,569
if I were not good at English and they

282
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,550
say yes to speak english and the Vince

283
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:47,529
beginning this for 20 years and they

284
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,170
seem to be and son have comedian just

285
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:54,250
mark in the English language it's just

286
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:57,339
like that for how many years 45 years

287
00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:00,819
I'm trying to study English so it is so

288
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:02,800
important I don't know what about French

289
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:04,899
would be important yes but let's start

290
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,649
with English and this was said by my

291
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:08,740
friend mark

292
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:12,189
hoyt from hacker choice and that's true

293
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:14,619
I've realized as I came here but

294
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:17,709
actually that's an effort you need to

295
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:21,910
make because if you speak English fifty

296
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:24,518
percent of the race is yours so you've

297
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,618
had a five fifty percent edge not as

298
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,050
good as Trump may be but you need to

299
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:30,819
speak English and you need to make the

300
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,099
effort this idea that there are many

301
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:37,089
options in Spanish that's a lie I want

302
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,610
you to speak English and this is this

303
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:44,139
was it for those looking for a job and I

304
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:45,639
said it so fifty percent ninety percent

305
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:47,170
solid rather than ninety percent of

306
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,550
human can't works for someone else and

307
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,368
what do you need to have your own

308
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:57,040
company and what should accompany look

309
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:59,170
like why would you start your company in

310
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,529
the spin you can on and start up and

311
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,509
it's easier elsewhere this is the life

312
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:08,470
for everyone it seems that it's free of

313
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:10,870
charge elsewhere that they give you so

314
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:12,790
many offers elsewhere and give you a

315
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,149
hundred million dollars on the table for

316
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:18,370
that you need to be squirrel it seems

317
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:19,870
the handicap of not having our own

318
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,689
businesses that it is way too difficult

319
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,779
it is difficult I've had companies in

320
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:27,370
several countries and what's easy here

321
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:30,730
it's difficult over there so that's not

322
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:33,160
skills this is just a way to be on the

323
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:37,420
back stage and say well I don't do it

324
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:41,499
because it I can't and many of you have

325
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:42,998
ideal ideas that are great I'm not a the

326
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,519
country makes it difficult for me maybe

327
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:48,670
you don't have the balls to do it

328
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:51,910
because often we go into those kind of

329
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,049
excuses if you have any concern any

330
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:55,660
knowledge and you think you can

331
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:57,699
contribute to something you won't be the

332
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,350
only one it seems that we need to make

333
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:01,889
up some invent something that it's a

334
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:05,169
single unique it's been invented already

335
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:07,120
imagination is finding something that is

336
00:17:05,169 --> 00:17:09,370
already been invented with some new

337
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:14,219
application and you create something

338
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:17,138
you'd stick and a ball and it is new and

339
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,290
that was for a mob so you would have as

340
00:17:17,138 --> 00:17:21,000
a classic you would have asked

341
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:25,050
you put them together and you got a mop

342
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,700
so this is not so exclusive but for a

343
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,639
few examples of course there are a few

344
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,620
but many things are part of inversions

345
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,120
where someone makes them up together and

346
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:38,070
they work and they become something

347
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:41,969
unique that very moment if you want to

348
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,740
suffer from free but doesn't matter this

349
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,180
important trick is said it setting up a

350
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,680
company starting up a company is not

351
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,050
about exploiting people it's about

352
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,380
becoming a leader working harder than

353
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:55,139
your own employees because you you

354
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:58,190
preach with example and this takes a

355
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:03,360
friend takes effort i got from colombia

356
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:04,920
the other day at noon i won it was at

357
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,080
the office and i left my office at nine

358
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,940
in the afternoon that this is in the

359
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,970
evening that sacrifice it hurts because

360
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,910
then at nine I was coming here you need

361
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,830
to be ready to what extent so how much

362
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,600
do you want to give of yourself just to

363
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,730
make your dream come true every

364
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,669
centimeter of this bitch needs to be

365
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:28,050
taken with black that's it you pay in

366
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:30,360
blood money doesn't come for free if you

367
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:32,250
think you can change things this is one

368
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,679
of the greatest options if you think you

369
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:37,920
can create impact on society with what

370
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:46,260
you need this is paramount just the

371
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:50,880
other thing at the MIT with Ricky that

372
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:53,670
is for children for patient cancer

373
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,300
patients who are kids and this is kind

374
00:18:53,670 --> 00:19:02,070
of a straw they got millions of dollars

375
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:04,350
and you can check the it use it for

376
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,560
polluted water do you push these it is

377
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,360
straw in and use suck it up and it

378
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,889
changes it all because you get clean

379
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,570
water this was an invention that would

380
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,610
change the world in African elsewhere

381
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,100
and this was just an invention you just

382
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:20,040
suck in clean water out of dirty water

383
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,379
polluted contaminated water it changes

384
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,629
things so making money can help change

385
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,610
the world and he will be a billionaire

386
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,910
because you see the social number 214

387
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:34,250
ventas so kids do not die anymore

388
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,250
because if they have stomach worms

389
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,889
winning a product of a feasible idea

390
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,360
that has a market beyond your mind

391
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,970
because I see people coming to me with

392
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,699
ideas like yes yes good but this is up

393
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:50,640
in your head because no one has done it

394
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:57,420
in the world maybe because no one is

395
00:19:50,640 --> 00:20:00,390
interested right maybe no one in the

396
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,929
world is interested in it to be visible

397
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:07,559
don't want picture it discuss it with

398
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:09,990
your friends team needs to be engaged

399
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:12,000
why did we win Europe well done is not

400
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,480
in the room we want because we were

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,580
perfect war machine still everyone knew

402
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,380
who they were attacking who who was

403
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,889
attacking booth Laden who was climbing

404
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:26,130
the team it equals success to accompany

405
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:28,140
often with business angels if there is

406
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:33,540
no team there's no money if the team is

407
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:36,270
just too okay next so individuality is

408
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:38,399
pointless in the current world you are

409
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:43,590
worth as much as these people as your

410
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,740
people this is what I am good social

411
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:49,678
skills but the employer has to have them

412
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,720
of course funding this tends to be the

413
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,090
score she can start out getting

414
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,799
financing funding in so many different

415
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,049
ways and use technicians you can do

416
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,980
things that comes that funding your

417
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:04,679
dream company doesn't need to be your

418
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:09,360
invention your sauce idea you can have

419
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:12,690
some kind of a hybrid mate you can bring

420
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,820
enough capital in a principle to move

421
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,130
towards your dream have my effort into

422
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,860
what I want to be but since I can get

423
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:23,850
work I can get jobs because you have it

424
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:26,510
then fund my my project like that and

425
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:29,639
there will be at point where the in fish

426
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:32,760
invention investment will these friends

427
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,559
families and falls this is a working

428
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,360
just for sometimes but you need to give

429
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,850
value to your company you need to work

430
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,709
very hard so that it has a value that

431
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,780
needs to be a project value of market

432
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,350
value or because you are in voice and

433
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,970
you're making

434
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,490
money and that's where you can find

435
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:50,580
mechanisms and I guess in civic and find

436
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:53,100
this for you I know of you in the US but

437
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:55,860
the the short list and is very difficult

438
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,240
you get through three hundred business

439
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,760
people who are interested and only three

440
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,789
will get the money when you get there to

441
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,460
Harvard and MIT you will get the funding

442
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:08,070
but it's not just like that not revealed

443
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,890
is like a CTF it's not just that I go

444
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:12,990
there and I get the money and as part of

445
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,120
that funding wheel all those and

446
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:17,190
business angels or investment mechanisms

447
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,129
you need to bargain for your friend

448
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,710
there are so many busters out there so

449
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:26,010
many bastards so do not get excited and

450
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,960
tized but the Apple if the apples in

451
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,549
exchange for your soul because these

452
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,630
will be offered to all of you and this

453
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:36,650
happens so you need to be smart enough

454
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:39,360
so do not lose control over the company

455
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:42,299
do not lose control over the company or

456
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:46,740
else you will end up like Steve Jobs you

457
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:50,100
get kicked out and just to finish this

458
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,679
up what what should it be like that

459
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,689
company you you you build it has to be a

460
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:58,679
company that needs to be different not

461
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,690
just look different so in the Spain we

462
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,429
live leaving the world of looks and

463
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:06,870
appearances we are also cool but that's

464
00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:09,539
a lie this is a politically correct if

465
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:12,750
bears speech and we don't hurt each

466
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:14,700
other this is a line then it you need to

467
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,770
be visionary your company needs to be

468
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,870
Albert anti said imagination is more

469
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,389
important than knowledge at knowledge

470
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:24,149
and ace it is you need to view things

471
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:26,010
picture things that others do jump and

472
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,230
these are around you this is

473
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,490
brainstorming continuously I can do

474
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,590
these and that needs to be aggressive

475
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,510
your company needs to be aggressive for

476
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,928
sure because you leave in a market where

477
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:39,450
you need need to make money for which

478
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:41,700
what maybe doesn't follow the Second

479
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:45,140
World War II Japanese model by the

480
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:48,419
Ministry of Defense Todd jump mr. Tata

481
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:52,290
who now killed 30 million people three

482
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:56,700
T's destroyed all killed them all take

483
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:57,280
it all not so much but companies need to

484
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,890
be a girl

485
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,450
self aggressive because you you are in a

486
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:05,800
market where you need to position

487
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:09,340
yourself you hard work in as well work

488
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,740
is the only thing merit is the only

489
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,679
thing that in the mid short and long

490
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:17,140
term will position here as a successful

491
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,780
company work and that's all there's no

492
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,190
other way around it I'm constant

493
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,460
development of course but if there's no

494
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,870
hard work no suffering if you do not pay

495
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,360
attention you will not be successful

496
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,850
it's all about work I'm getting your

497
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:34,899
degree growing up it's all about hard

498
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:37,990
work do not don't have a confession for

499
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:40,480
mystic egg company do not settle down

500
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:43,360
with what you have this idea of being

501
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,270
earnest the size this is the one in mr.

502
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,600
Robert that gets up high with heroine

503
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:52,320
and and and that's what i don't like

504
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,090
about mr. road because it's kind of a

505
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,159
donkey and he is also a genius it

506
00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:01,270
doesn't work like that right you cannot

507
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:06,100
settle like that do not get an S beside

508
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:11,110
sort of numbed so this way it works

509
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:15,120
better ethical for clients and employees

510
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:17,830
if an a non ethical company it's a

511
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,169
deceased company and this is missing in

512
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,470
Spain he needs to be good for you people

513
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:26,110
for your people meaning that if they

514
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,090
leave their lives if they leave their

515
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,490
jobs happy because they have a means of

516
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,679
living and filled fulfilled and your

517
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,920
clients as well are happy with their

518
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:38,770
serve service that's ethical company and

519
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,470
that was set by Aristotle a few years

520
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:45,340
back and it exists but we don't read

521
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:48,330
anymore right we we burnt down books and

522
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:51,790
same as with fun high 61 what was it and

523
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:55,960
you need to pay your taxes we don't like

524
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:58,389
it oh crap it's time to pay my taxes

525
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,070
again yes the society we live in the

526
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:04,060
opportunities we were given it to be

527
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:07,149
funded we need to find those who will

528
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,070
study a degree the health system which

529
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,280
which means that a successful company

530
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,439
needs to pay taxes

531
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:17,920
the more you pay for more money to make

532
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,110
it seems that the more they pay the less

533
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,980
they they they make but actually if

534
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:26,530
you're making them money you're paying

535
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:28,120
our taxes you're creating an ecosystem

536
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,950
because you're paid taxes and your

537
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,080
browser will be used more and even if

538
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,420
i'm working on cybersecurity this kind

539
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,570
of a coil we're up tornado and it all

540
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:40,000
goes back to you the one son richness

541
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:42,700
and you need to keep that in mind same

542
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,200
you see the game on islands and Panama

543
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:47,800
that what they try to do is not to be a

544
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,420
thin a dime and unit didn't the leader

545
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,370
doesn't mean that they are the best

546
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:55,330
technician because you are going to

547
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:57,669
develop a business and so many things

548
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:00,370
revolving around it so no matter how

549
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,500
good you've been how hard you've started

550
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,928
your degree your team is not just like

551
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:09,970
that engineer ring can be recruited

552
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:11,620
that's your employees so do not really

553
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,679
need to be the most technical one if you

554
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:18,129
