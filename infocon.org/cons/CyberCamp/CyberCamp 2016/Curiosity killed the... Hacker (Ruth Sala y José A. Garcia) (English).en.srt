judge and so we have the skills to

46
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,810
defend in the misunderstood haka that

47
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,930
could be a cracker more than a hug

48
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:40,290
vulnera din some limits or boundaries or

49
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:44,820

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,760
their TV show and they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm a</font>

62
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:24,300
haka and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sauron who was huge yesterday</font>

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,180
explaining that we had no criminal we

65
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,220
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not criminals and so when you see</font>

66
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,180
the clip where you say that we are

67
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,850
hacking the Pentagon so funny yeah it's

68
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,459
funny and it is not because if you think

69
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">of yourself as a hacker as a researcher</font>

70
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,019
that's not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this cruise they</font>

71
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:52,019
understand being naughty pushing the

72
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:54,360
limits all the way to crime so that's

73
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,000
kind of a reflection<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like to</font>

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,150
share they say we get bored having to

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,670
explain over and over this is planation

76
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,430
at but its necessary we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are no criminals</font>

77
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:09,059
or a hacker is no criminal is just a

78
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:12,209
researcher<font color="#CCCCCC"> with curiosity what's the</font>

79
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,459
greatest engine for learning that's good

80
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:20,738
real surname what happens with curiosity

81
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:24,520
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that often it takes us to places</font>

82
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:26,979
that might be out of sight now at

83
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,979
Christmas I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to those houses</font>

control Wayne<font color="#E5E5E5"> it consented and agreed</font>

148
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:17,380
upon together with the victim and with

149
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,080
hauser or earlier we came up with a

150
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,169
project as presentation so let's get a

151
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:28,300
virtual machine and let's challenge them

152
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:30,880
to get inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see if you could get</font>

153
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,549
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> admin privileges for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

154
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,338
they had to send us an email back no one

155
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:39,338
made it no one made it this was a

156
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:43,810
project that was ready for else come

157
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:46,170
encounter 2015 on four days before the

158
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:49,260
presentation i gave we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gay</font>

159
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,649
an open door so that they could break

160
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:57,779
into our virtual machine so let's

161
00:08:52,649 --> 00:09:00,240
explain what ethical hacking means so

162
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:04,350
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a company that is willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,740
know where the black holes are and they

164
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:11,699
contact a professional there is a

165
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:15,589
contract stating clearly what is to be

166
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:17,790
done it is a controlled attack were

167
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:23,430
vulnerabilities of the system are<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

168
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:25,649
found and find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that could</font>

169
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:32,670
be exploited by third parties so you

170
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:35,269
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a cracker with permission no</font>

171
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,760
risk should come to the system or

172
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:41,279
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no compromise of the system so</font>

173
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,410
if you like Hawking noon it to

174
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,439
compromise<font color="#CCCCCC"> your company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because they are</font>

175
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,380
your client what are the minimum

176
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,899
conditions to experience around there

177
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">are students that are kids out there 11</font>

178
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,990
12 years old mingling around that's the

179
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:01,170
time that's a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are here to</font>

180
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:04,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">get the information hacking researching</font>

181
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,449
that's good but under control you need

182
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:09,170
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hack in lab or have a virtual</font>

183
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:13,170
machine up or a virtual environment app

184
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:17,519
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> now not real so what do we find</font>

185
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:21,269
when we are asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hard well we start</font>

191
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:39,839
this from officer saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay lick ah</font>

192
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,069
this is my plane<font color="#CCCCCC"> ticket would you print</font>

193
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,899
it for me in a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're such a</font>

194
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:48,180
holidays that these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> receptions would</font>

195
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:51,300
say yes perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there you've got the</font>

196
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:56,040
virus in and it's so easy so is it to

197
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,079
get inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company so what is in the</font>

00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,319
agreement agreement with a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:10,360
into someone's kitchen are you going<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

202
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:15,340
you only have a limited time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will not</font>

203
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:18,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">hurt them for two years what the terms</font>

204
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:21,370
and conditions are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear you should</font>

205
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,190
never buy pants or skip even a comma

206
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,080
first because of traces because if you

207
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">go too far if you keep something for</font>

208
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,310
yourself I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the lawyer to that</font>

209
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,200
company and then I asked us<font color="#E5E5E5"> our lady out</font>

210
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,420
early please come and do reverse

211
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,840
engineering here and forensic lab

212
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:40,510
reverse forensics let's pull the thread

213
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:46,660
and see how far we go and who we can

214
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:49,300
find there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are methods based on the type</font>

215
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:53,290
of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will be conducting there's</font>

216
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:56,020
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly standardized o.o what I guess</font>

217
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:02,890
you know it this is for software

218
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:07,630
vulnerability detection Oh SST<font color="#CCCCCC"> mm that's</font>

219
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:10,449
what was this for its information

220
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,810
systems right so different systems to

221
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,760
check different systems and then

222
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:19,930
wireless questions where vulnerabilities

223
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,140
are as part of these parameters on how

224
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,670
to hack<font color="#E5E5E5"> them into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something there is</font>

225
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,090
kind of a science science and

226
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:30,610
methodology to check the security and

227
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:33,220
processes communications internet

228
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:38,080
wireless security and physical security

229
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:43,600
and safety<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our company and here's my</font>

230
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:48,220
guy so rude explain what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit more</font>

231
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,610
theoretical legally why's everything

232
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:55,510
having to do with intrusion into our

233
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:58,480
company's security have you heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> haha</font>

234
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">cracker so how come you all know that</font>

235
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,850
word right everyone knows what a hacker

236
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:07,360
is but maybe we do not all know what the

237
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:10,520
right definition for hacker is and so we

238
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,940
need to go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun is Academy where</font>

239
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:19,550
hacker is defined with a computer pirate

240
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:22,490
those of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have gray hairs there's</font>

241
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:25,849
this term cracka that's been on for

242
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:29,060
years now and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a security</font>

243
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,280
expert Simone who had that curiosity not

244
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,949
limiting themselves to finding out where

245
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,220
fails and vulnerabilities were but they

246
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,960
were also crash in systems years ago

247
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,690
well years ago Vince<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago for</font>

248
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,870
computer science and years ago crackers

249
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:47,480
would do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all for the glory and honor</font>

250
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:51,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they do it for money in exchange</font>

251
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:54,950
for money as simple as that there are

252
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,630
some stages that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite common common</font>

253
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:02,080
for both disciplines crackers and

254
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:06,310
hackers so action steps first it's a

255
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:09,350
finding information on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google dogs so a</font>

256
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:12,500
full enos in on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google you need to find</font>

257
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:15,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">fans always aimed at an attack you have</font>

258
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,950
social engineering then it's all done on

259
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,110
facebook maybe this is not that common

260
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,450
anymore because we got this digital

261
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:26,870
education now but we used to post I'm

262

265
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:41,540
against us and that's why most people

266
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,880
say don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> post too much on the internet</font>

267
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,550
a bit more senior tech would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> port</font>

268
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:51,200
scanning port 21 well I will explain it

in a minute ftp 22 port 80 for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

vulnerabilities worth mentioning wasp

272
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:05,270
and everything owasp and everything else

273
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:07,490
is some websites where they say what the

274
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,610
vulnerabilities of some environments are

275
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:14,060
probably most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know joomla or</font>

276
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:16,850
wordpress what many websites are

277
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,180
produced and for those vulnerabilities

278
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:24,310
there are people people looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

279
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,310
those vulnerabilities for those

massive information management

281
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:32,899
environments and let's say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

282
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:37,099
version 32 for joomla and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they find this</font>

283
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:40,040
a vulnerability for SQL attacks and then

284
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,930
everyone who has that version if it's

285
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">not properly secured we'll have that</font>

286
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,399
very vulnerability so go<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture how</font>

292
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,949
and the destination and sniff for the

293
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,779
information sniff out all the traffic

294
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:10,250
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network I</font>

will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user keys that's what we</font>

296
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,399
always want the admin passwords the

00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:19,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">network is a scanned and that's when the</font>

298
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,720
attack starts we find specific

299
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:27,139
vulnerabilities and such as SQL

300
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:31,430
injections and as always the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

301
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:35,059
increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> privileged chance to go in with</font>

302
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:37,279
a new user that has admin privileges or

303
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:39,620
make sure that the standard user through

304
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,600
a fail becomes on admin user to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

305
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,600
machine so it I own the machine then

306
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:54,050
access gathering attacks I tend to be

two things they take control of the

331
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:57,330
machine to infect other machines many of

332

the websites we connect we lock into

333
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:04,560
could be totally legit and yet they've

been<font color="#CCCCCC"> cracked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they've had a card injected</font>

small window and it's malicious code and

337
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,639
the minute I log<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that website which</font>

339
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,570
happens it will infect me my machine if

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,590
my computer is not protected I said

341
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:30,270
before or refer before to the cracker

342
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:33,090
stages and I said one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are necessary is the social engineering</font>

344
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:40,770
which means finding out things about

345
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:44,190
their victim to attack on them I need to

346
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:53,070
know things about them preferences needs

347
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:55,260
to attack them on the WIC spot and and

348
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:58,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a real case I wanted to share</font>

349
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:01,890
here and it was sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me I'm I'm no</font>

350

351
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:10,320
written to help someone so half into

352

someone else's account and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

him so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's so used to getting this kind</font>

355
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:24,470
of requests and here so

356
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,449
someone sends me lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font>

357
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,480
with the email accounts because what

358
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,179
they want is this one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a jealousy</font>

359
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,580
attack and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have access to</font>

360
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:41,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> partners I can to find out what's</font>

361
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:45,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on and this is so very illegal so</font>

362
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:48,290
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just that go far they go</font>

363
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:54,500
farther they say I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data I go</font>

364
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:56,418
I got the pictures and still sends me

365
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:08,000
specific information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

366
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:12,380
person and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one thing and here</font>

367
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,150
here it is and they say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you</font>

368
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,309
cannot do it doesn't matter doesn't

369
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:19,870
matter but I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given you all the</font>

370
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:25,600
information so that you gather it for me

371
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:25,600
of course I paid no<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention and paper</font>

372
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:34,580
so stages for a hacker ice explain what

373
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:37,760
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> crack-up does it would be a person boy</font>

374
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:43,340
girl or company doing something just to

375
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:45,410
crush take down the website a hacker

376
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be similar to a cracker but as</font>

377
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:51,860
Rufus it would said before there are two

378
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:54,649
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to behave either out of curiosity</font>

379
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,870
they are just looking into sides and

380
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,210
when they spot backs they call the

381
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:01,340
company and warms them there is this

382
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,940
mistake or this this back the company

383
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,610
end reply could hire them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> solve vid</font>

384
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,470
back or just sue them because they got

385
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,899
in without permission and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

386
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:14,480
crime difference main difference between

387
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,150
hacker and cracker is that hugger breaks

388
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,400
nothing damn thats that spire amount

389
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:26,559
then we can consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's legal</font>

390
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:31,340
or not that's up to Ruth so a haka is

391
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:33,800
it's not a computer pirate right that is

392
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we need to dwell on and</font>

393
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,190
explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people let's see what</font>

394
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the time</font>

395
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:43,600
of ethical hacking so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> hugging</font>

have white gray and black do you know

399
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,280
which each one is means if you don't

400

they've been requested never be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never break anything down but</font>

406
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:26,990
they become judges oh we get no names

407
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:30,200
but if there is an association attacking

408
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,730
on or brutalizing animals there's this

409
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,400
group of hot girls saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm taking</font>

down your website the way across in a

412
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,970
but they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some reasons specific</font>

413
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,650
reasons you should ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> act no names all</font>

00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:50,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the we all know who I referred to and</font>

415
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:54,560
then black heart the ones that look what

416
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:57,230
they are crackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> rap rather they used</font>

436
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:55,860
reverse engineering I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font>

437
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:58,919
app into source code I'll see what what

438
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:02,699
up the spot where the user passwords are

439
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:05,550
requested or where the app is moved on

440
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,730
and I bypass it where I built up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hole</font>

441
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:16,020
up to bypass it that would be reverse

442
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:18,720
engineering we know types of Hawkins now

443
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:21,570
I'm based on that there are different

444
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,960
ways to behave we can have the white box

445
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:27,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">mm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably you've heard about that</font>

446
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,000
that's when a haka a computer

447
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:34,379
professional knows how the app works

448
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,240
just perfectly fine and as they know how

449
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:42,480
it works they know what all the

450
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:47,850
parameters are we have great box that's

451
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,980
where that's when<font color="#CCCCCC"> only part of the app</font>

452
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,199
is known some things are known some

453
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,000
others aren't and then if you know

454
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,220
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the application and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

455
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,350
in blindly I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find bags to</font>

456
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:02,340
see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> far i get and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know nothing</font>

457
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:04,860
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's black boss bucks Fred</font>

458
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:10,230
printing do you know what it is without

459
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:13,199
reading it on the screen<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course that</font>

460
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:16,710
would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first stirpes step towards</font>

461
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,740
getting information out through open

462
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:22,080
source intelligence techniques finding

463
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:25,050
information on social media and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

464
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,080
internet getting all public information

465

and that's fully legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be done</font>

466
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:35,490
no problem you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> find information on</font>

467
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:37,440
the network on the website sorry and you

468
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,120
go to who is it is fully legal and get

469
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,580
information on an IP address everything

470
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,709
else you can have dns cause you know

471
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,080
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite an attack on DNS</font>

472
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:50,309
addresses and they I think they crushed

and mop they look into every port until

476
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,680
they find vulnerabilities there and then

477
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,860
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these work is done</font>

478
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:10,490
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do we produce an audit report</font>

479
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:12,709
a report that is this thick we take it

480
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:18,680
to the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we say through oh</font>

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:20,810
send techniques by putting your your

482
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,180

483
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:27,379
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it all I we found these all</font>

484
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:29,570
these bags all these solutions come

485
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:34,070
together as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in on the report</font>

486
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:36,530
and then the CEO sits with the pile of

487
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,350
documental says oh thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

488
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:44,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we will do it sometime sometime in</font>

489
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:47,770
the future what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the most of</font>

490
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:51,080
working as a researcher will as a

491
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:53,840
researching lawyer because law is

492
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,750
different now if the lawyers not just

493
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:01,100
behind the desk waiting for customers to

494
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:05,660
come in and trying to understand how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

495
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:07,939
all works now what we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is find</font>

496
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:11,330
out how information can be sniffed out

497
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,430
of a wife a what operating systems had

498
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:17,419
what vulnerabilities in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawaiian so the</font>

499
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:20,540
lawyers roles changed in turn that means

500
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:23,060
that I am up there patrolling using

501
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,790
anonymous profiles because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

502
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,639
to be identified it makes sense and so

503
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:32,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that brought me to understanding what</font>

504
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,930
the criminal is like so the criminology

505
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:40,040
offender what are they like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

506
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:42,020
crooks are defined by is the need to

507
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">share that information that they've</font>

508
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:49,700
broken into something they need to tell

509
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be patient but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

510
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:56,210
don't you think you won't be fine found

511
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:59,780
I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone will be kissing and</font>

512
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:01,820
telling that's all about their ego it's

513
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:05,389
such a challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> breaking into things</font>

514
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:08,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I there's an urge to share it and a</font>

515
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:10,670
different fora you have just hints and

516
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:14,690
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be patient and finding</font>

517
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:16,790
it out what what can happen what could

518
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen to you</font>

519
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:23,270
so according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to law what can happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

520
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:25,189
you intrusions out of curiosity if you

521
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,270
know there's a back there a hole there's

522
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,940
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been there and you</font>

523
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:32,900
viewing their keep it to yourself or or

524
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:35,630
tell it to someone that will have no

525
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:38,830
problem sharing it I'll call them see

526
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:42,290
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> article from the criminal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code in</font>

527
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:45,679
2015 it's that what security measures

528
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,909
when it was open doesn't matter it's a

529
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,410
place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

engine and you've not been hired for

531
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:58,280
that you've been not authorized and get

532
00:28:53,930 --> 00:29:00,380
you partied or made other people gives

533
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:03,860
access to other people other people say

534
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:07,040
well please go in for me or you hold it

against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the owners will that's when you</font>

536
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:13,190
add up months and years of a prison

537
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:19,520
centers if it's the first time around

538
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:22,520
maybe it is suspended so revealing

539
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,310
secrets so you found<font color="#CCCCCC"> it maybe you got</font>

540
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,590
information and maybe you've kept it

541
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:30,530
kept it for yourself or you might be

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:33,260
using technical tapping or<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine to</font>

545
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to broadcast it that is one to four</font>

546
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:45,640
years at prison centers and find 12 24

547
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:49,250
24 months it's not just paying money

548
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,830
sometimes you get a fine sentence but if

549
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,960
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the money but two days</font>

550
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:57,379
that you do not pay you spend a night in

551
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,440
prison<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes no no fun it makes no no</font>

552
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:05,060
it's not fun right maybe it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

553
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:08,960
so it's been 60 years right so articled

554
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:12,050
beers if you intercept non-public

555
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:17,140
information of transmission sorry often

556
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:19,730
of IT data so now we add up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

557
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:23,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">years because its two-year sentence this</font>

558
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:23,230
article this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for you</font>

559
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:30,360
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that Ruth was saying</font>

560
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,480
about how you could continue summing up

561
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,508
adding things this is a perfect attacked

562
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:43,409
cut it out through RP spoofing as it

563
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:45,629
says on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see there so</font>

564
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:50,220
an IP address is being attacked this is

565
00:30:45,629 --> 00:30:53,340
and local one and number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data is</font>

566
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:57,230
being traded through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arts attacks</font>

567
00:30:53,340 --> 00:31:01,918
that is to say in this case email

568
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:05,610
account and the key so this is illegal<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

569
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:09,240
cannot extract any a key if someone well

570
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:12,719
gives me the key password ok it's ok if

571
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,389
they give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me so for instance now</font>

572
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,789
we are dealing with a case handling a

573
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:20,189
case and social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media so a person that</font>

574
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:24,629
had the social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> accounts hijacked</font>

575
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:26,759
and we are working to recover that

576
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:29,699
social media<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have the person's</font>

577
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:31,470
passwords but we have the consent<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

578
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,049
present agreement of the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

579
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:36,360
the password actually went to be honest

580
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:39,029
we don't read all that information that

581
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,369
it says there and this is the easiest

582
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:44,399
parts in terms of viewing so we have

583
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:46,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">this old exid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML and this is the part</font>

584
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,549
that we are getting this is what we are

585
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:53,369
getting this time so if i'm not mistaken

586
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:56,299
this is a virtual machine disease well

587
00:31:53,369 --> 00:32:01,230
we are working this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email account</font>

588
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:04,019
and this is where we are just getting on

589
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,509
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data from that email account</font>

590
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:09,899
and these that i'm showing you now is

591
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:12,749
what we said before<font color="#E5E5E5"> about real attacks</font>

592
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:14,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually this is an actual attack it</font>

593
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:18,119
is from the first of december this year

594
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:20,908
so that is to save a few days ago so

595
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:22,860
real IPS actual IPS that are being

596
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:25,230
attacking that are are attacking a

597
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,389
machine and because well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought that</font>

598
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,309
perhaps this was not enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for you</font>

599
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:35,539
to have a clear understanding as to how

600
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:35,539
it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have machine open</font>

601
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:44,809
well it is not easy to read but well at

602
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:47,419
least you can see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it's and</font>

603
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:53,840
these are attacks that are being

604
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:58,190
committed today January sorry full of

605
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:02,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">December Sunday it's doing nothing this</font>

606
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:06,200
is an IP address 163 finishing 160 where

607
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:08,889
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a strange name for that IP it is</font>

608
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,410
trying to access with a username 111

609
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:16,390
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> password sxx and notice what I</font>

610
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:21,530
told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you before this is a user password</font>

611
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:24,760
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this shows here user 1234 password</font>

612
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:27,530
probably they are looking for username

613
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,350
1234 I'm probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password is also 1</font>

614
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 it is very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important or when</font>

615
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:36,610
you set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up your email account you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

616
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:39,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">besides you name it never ever use</font>

617
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,969
passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> as easy as these ones some</font>

618
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,470
people go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say well mine is more</font>

619
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:49,429
difficult like one two three four<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

620
00:33:42,470 --> 00:34:00,220
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven okay don't do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please so</font>

621
00:33:49,429 --> 00:34:06,260
what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font>

622
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:13,668
temporary attack no it is not didn't

623
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:16,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice that all right so since yesterday</font>

624
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:18,859
I've been seen these IPS which are often

625
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,409
the ones from which attacks are

626
00:34:18,859 --> 00:34:24,429
committed so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an IP that is</font>

627
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:34,690
trying to access at any cost through

628
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:38,570
port 22 ftp port because service have a

629
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:41,210
minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of security whenever there</font>

630
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:44,720
is some intrusion<font color="#CCCCCC"> lat time so part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font>

631
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:48,379
IP then d IP get the access denial

632
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,888
denied if these were not the case we

633
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,339
could

634
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:58,450
say that that company hasn't got enough

635
00:34:51,339 --> 00:35:01,519
security implemented but now<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's see</font>

636
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:04,220
other types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks not only through</font>

637
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:08,000
ftp so this is an attack to an email

638
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:11,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">server again we have a number of ips</font>

639
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,140
trying to gain access to it to get to it

640
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:19,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Toli there are some list of some</font>

641
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:23,930
servers that have a list of ips that are

642
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:27,769
on a blacklist that is to say they those

643
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:33,890
IPS are blocked by default many email

644
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:40,009
servers are recognized that or detected

645
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:47,210
ipes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a blacklist and for IPS</font>

646
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:51,589
automatically stopped so expand how

647
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:55,759
servers do that stop those IPS that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

648
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:58,819
blacklisted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play a</font>

649
00:35:55,759 --> 00:36:03,259
clip I'm sure that you've seen the clip

650
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:07,299
before it's a video as to how to guess

651
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:12,710
when an IP address comes from so this is

652
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:14,869
solve their website such as who is so

653
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:18,170
with someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> I texted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you equipment if</font>

654
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:20,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just enter the IP address IP address</font>

655
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:22,549
that appears in the logs of any

656
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:26,210
management<font color="#CCCCCC"> program that you may have in</font>

657
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:29,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">place for email or ftp you can easily</font>

658
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:31,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">get at that IP nearly all the attacks</font>

659
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:35,359
fabricator and come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> china from</font>

660
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:37,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">russia countries with which we have no</font>

661
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,410
agreements or where it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult</font>

662
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:42,079
to implement any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

663
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:48,069
therefore those IPS will be irreversibly

664
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:52,519
lost and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> will never get to the</font>

665
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:54,980
perpetrator to the attacker because the

666
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:56,720
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with not disclose that</font>

667
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,210
information to us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why so many</font>

668
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,660
attacks are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being contacted from china</font>

669
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,220
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooperation just</font>

670
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,089
cooperation between<font color="#E5E5E5"> China and our</font>

671
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:12,740
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just minimum cooperation and</font>

672
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:16,040
now Ruth is all yours so we move on with

673
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:19,430
our rep easy recipe where were we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ate we</font>

674
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:23,690
had a toad ready discovery secrets

675
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:27,740
disclosure penalty from six months to

676
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:31,730
two years the company oh my god last

677
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:34,700
week I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a call I was called direct</font>

678
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:38,180
and they said oh we saw you on this talk

679
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:42,500
so we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to come over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

680
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:44,240
then to<font color="#CCCCCC"> frighten our 140 developers and</font>

681
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,330
I said well if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want me to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there I</font>

682
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:51,439
will be there why is that well if you

683
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:55,580
are an employee of your back for HP IBM

684
00:37:51,440 --> 00:38:00,140
or small or medium-sized company you

685
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:04,370
have access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party data use an</font>

686
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:08,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">ib employee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh you name it or any other</font>

687
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:12,950
company you will be held accountable

688
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:15,980
legally however this would also impact

689
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:19,399
the company that you work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

690
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,710
therefore do have two frightened

691
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:26,930
employees<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be frightened have to</font>

692
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:31,040
be want<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to be trained and be very</font>

693
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:35,149
well aware that the impact can also be

694
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,130
an impact on the company and then

695
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,980
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not be very happy about</font>

696
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:42,830
it setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a business takes a long</font>

697
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,740
time and lots of effort so companies do

698
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:48,470
not really want to have these type of

699
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:54,250
employees so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more of the same</font>

700
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:58,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I skip that so damaged crime</font>

701
00:38:54,250 --> 00:39:02,320
causing damage on come to through third

702
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:06,799
parties once i'm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> i steal data I</font>

703
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:12,190
tampered with I<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted I make data</font>

704
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:16,460
unavailable so now sentence is from

705
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:19,940
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> and two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> runs six months to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

706
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,859
yes then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would negotiate with the</font>

707
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,440
public prosecutor it is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

708
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:26,630
that this crime has been committed if I

709
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,970
know something if I've reported to the

710
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:34,760
police or law enforcement no enforcement

711
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:37,040
agencies have<font color="#E5E5E5"> specialists in technology</font>

712
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are highly specialized they have</font>

713
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:47,690
very good teams and what is the

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigation process like using</font>

attacked to report the incident then to

716
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:55,040
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the help of the police and then you</font>

717
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:59,150
gather the evidence once you have all

718
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,369
the evidence so they may decide to wait

719
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:05,089
what happens with that person how this

720
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:09,290
person is moving then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> up until all</font>

00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">time to do it these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lengths of time to</font>

865
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,558
do it and sometimes

866
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:51,299
just not have the material time to

867
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:55,079
gather all the evidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need</font>

868
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:58,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">and other times whenever the case wants</font>

869
00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:04,460
to well reaches the national police

870
00:47:58,109 --> 00:48:08,670
forces or our hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> us as forensics</font>

871
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:12,299
experts the evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> x is volatile</font>

872
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:14,430
it sometimes evidence disappears and

873
00:48:12,299 --> 00:48:17,819
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> having said that will have to say</font>

874
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:21,690
that the evil always<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead of a</font>

875
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:24,660
bigger system and we are behind evil so

876
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,910
there are three elements three elements

877
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:29,098
and from my experience I said that these

878
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:32,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">three elements no matter how fast we</font>

879
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:35,970
want to produce legislation to make

880
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">legislation and policies we have legal</font>

881
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:43,319
system which saves called privacy a lot

882
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:47,299
then the evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> is volatile and then</font>

883
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:52,380
the legal experts<font color="#E5E5E5"> professionals are</font>

884
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:54,990
short-handed and then well the criminal

885
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,630
prosecution system has improved a lot

886
00:48:54,990 --> 00:49:00,569
has advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot and likely continues</font>

hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> to questions or to comments first</font>

891
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:26,650
of all I has that in Germany scan import

892
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:28,720
is considered footprinting apparently as

893
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:30,940
far as i know it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> illegal I don't know</font>

894
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,310
whether you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or not is it</font>

895
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:36,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider fingerprinting here always it</font>

896
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:41,340
for printing what happens here and

897
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:48,009
seconds sure to go in the US apparently

898
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:53,770
well it's not legal for judges to issue

899
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:55,630
a search warrant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> research the</font>

900
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:58,950
computer no matter what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is located</font>

901
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:02,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if it is located</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on China in China</font>

902
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:04,990
so does that mean that DNA is authorized

903
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:07,089
to do espionage but you know that

904
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:09,009
according to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our clinical prosecution</font>

905
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:12,460
though having a tool that would allow

906
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:15,700
you to do an entry intro intrusion<font color="#CCCCCC"> Helen</font>

907
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:17,800
minutes so having that tool makes it

908
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:22,240
already everyone doing makes it already

909

00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:40,630
fact of owning those tools having those

913
