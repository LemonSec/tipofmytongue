[Applause]

2
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:08,039
well a cyber cam my name is Alicia clock

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm a technical program manager at lyft

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:15,320
in security and privacy which basically

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,310
means that my job is to ensure that

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,840
everybody in the company is able to

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,119
implement our security and privacy

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,130
programs I'm here to talk to you today

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,259
about how you can succeed in

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,250
cybersecurity even if you never really

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,580
thought that that was where you were

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,880
going to go with your life

13
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:36,449
so first off you may be aware that there

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,800
is a extreme shortage of cybersecurity

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,800
professionals one estimate predicts that

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,879
there will be six million jobs in

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,919
cybersecurity by 2020 and that 1.5

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,620
million of those jobs will be unfilled

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,239
so we need you we need a lot of people

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,209
coming in and joining us in the

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,879
cybersecurity field but we don't just

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,800
need bodies we need diverse bodies we

23
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,390
need people with experience from all

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,048
walks of life from all kinds of

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,400
backgrounds if without people who are

26
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,950
diverse without people who have

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,229
experienced many different things we

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,140
can't protect everybody let me give you

29
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,830
a quick example how many of you know

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:22,500
google hangouts you familiar ok how many

31
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,810
of you remember old gchat the precursor

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:31,530
to hangouts ok so I'm a big fan of old G

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,020
chat for one particular reason in G chat

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,799
you're able to set your status as

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,750
invisible which meant that you were

36
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,610
online but nobody could see that you

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,130
were online I didn't know you know were

38
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,530
you there were you away what was going

39
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,070
on when I was working at Google I

40
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,140
participated in a user study by the

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,139
hangouts team they wanted to know why I

42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,969
was still using old g chat this and i

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,530
said because of invisible mode because

44
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,169
hangouts didn't have it at the time and

45
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,850
they said why would you want to be

46
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,320
invisible don't you want your friends to

47
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,969
know when you're online don't you want

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,440
to you know have them be able to find

49
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:12,700
you and I said well yes if everybody in

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,579
my contacts book was a friend of mine

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,379
but that's not necessarily the case when

52
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,580
I was in high school I had a stalker

53
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:25,179
this person would hunt me down harass me

54
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:28,890
send me emails and if they saw me on

55
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:31,840
gchat they would chat at me all the time

56
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:36,309
invisible mode let me still use gchat

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,870
but my stalker didn't know that I was on

58
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,549
and so they couldn't come and harass me

59
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,650
and so I told this to the Google

60
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:44,049
Hangouts team and they were they were

61
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,560
shocked they had honestly never thought

62
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:46,599
about that

63
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,180
that there might be a situation where

64
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:52,839
you wouldn't want somebody to know your

65
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,640
online status for them they thought it

66
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,110
was a really awesome feature that your

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,420
friends would always know you know okay

68
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,000
they're on their phone or their away so

69
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,869
I shouldn't message them right now you

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,180
know they weren't sitting there going

71
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,560
whoa hahaha like we're gonna take away

72
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,120
your privacy by taking away your ability

73
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,799
to hide your status they genuinely

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,750
thought they were helping they just

75
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:15,430
hadn't been exposed to a situation where

76
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,630
that wasn't helpful so fast forward a

77
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,810
few months Thanks

78
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,900
I think in part two my telling which the

79
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:27,100
the hangouts team this you can now hide

80
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,989
your status in Google Hangouts so that's

81
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,750
why we need people from all walks of

82
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,600
life we need people who aren't just your

83
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,090
typical hacker your aren't just your

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,370
typical cyber security person we need

85
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,470
people who have had experiences like

86
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,730
being stalked or living in another

87
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,190
country or coming from a different

88
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,230
culture or whatever your background is

89
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,730
we need you we need you to help protect

90
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,750
people like you we need to bring your

91
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:55,510
ideas into the community now you may be

92
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:59,049
wondering why do I talk about you know

93
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:01,929
diverse backgrounds and all of this what

94
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:05,500
qualifies me to say you know you should

95
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:08,650
leave your existing job and you know

96
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,349
come join cybersecurity that's me uh

97
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:15,430
when I graduated high school a while ago

98
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:17,560
I when I graduated I was going to go to

99
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,959
Hollywood and be a screenwriter so I

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,519
went to Vancouver film school and I got

101
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,630
a screenwriting degree it's gonna write

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,630
for movies and television

103
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,780
fast forward about 1213 years and Here I

104
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:35,169
am giving talks at major industry

105
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,260
conferences so I do have some experience

106
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:39,820
in coming from a completely different

107
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,930
place than your traditional

108
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:46,450
cybersecurity background so how did I

109
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,160
get from Vancouver Film School where I

110
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:50,950
was going to be a screenwriter to

111
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,090
working for some very big names in the

112
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,979
technical industry I learned three main

113
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,479
things along the way and it's these

114
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,340
three things that I want to share with

115
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,560
you in the hopes that you can take them

116
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,010
and apply them to your own life and come

117
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,990
and join us in cybersecurity before I

118
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,560
tell you what those are I'm gonna say

119
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,640
you'll notice that none of them are

120
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,890
technical things I'm not going to sit

121
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,770
here and give you a list of you need to

122
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:19,360
know these encryption algorithms or you

123
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,490
need to know how to do pen tests and

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,410
none of that there's been a lot of

125
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,030
really amazing people already on this

126
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,580
stage and at this conference talking

127
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,169
about technic the technical things that

128
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,659
will be helpful for you in your life is

129
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:34,270
in cybersecurity I'm gonna talk to you

130
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,460
about some more general things things

131
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,380
that will that you might not learn in a

132
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,510
textbook that might you know they won't

133
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:43,120
come up on a list of what you need to

134
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,750
know and hopefully you'll be able to use

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,330
them in your own life so the first thing

136
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:52,930
that I learned was how are you going to

137
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,490
make it happen so this happened when I

138
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,320
was a kid I was really big into

139
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,300
Taekwondo I would go to all the classes

140
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,790
and I will go to competitions and I'll

141
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,930
practice all the time and one day my

142
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,800
studio announced that they were going to

143
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:11,230
send a delegation to South Korea of

144
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,870
students to train with some famous South

145
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:18,130
Korean Taekwondo masters and everything

146
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:21,730
wanted to go I problem I was 15 at the

147
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:24,400
time and I was living in Michigan so

148
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:27,840
that's how far Michigan is from South

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,969
Korea it's not exactly an overnight camp

150
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,229
any respectable parent any any parent in

151
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,380
their right mind would have said you're

152
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:38,500
15 you can't go across the world for two

153
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,350
weeks unsupervised but my mom could

154
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,170
say that she said how are you going to

155
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,880
make it happen and that caught me a

156
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,640
little bit off guard because honestly I

157
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,900
was kind of expecting her to say no but

158
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,810
she said how are you going to make it

159
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,359
happen so I thought about it and I said

160
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,700
all right I'm gonna need to fundraise

161
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,920
I'm going to need to find somebody at my

162
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,150
school who is also going who can be my

163
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,100
chaperone so that you know my parents

164
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:06,539
are reassured that somebody's in charge

165
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:10,380
with me and I did all of these things

166
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,090
long story short I went to South Korea

167
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,969
now my mom didn't just come up with this

168
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,799
out of nowhere I she said how are you

169
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,290
going to make it happen instead of no

170
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,760
because when she was in college somebody

171
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:29,080
told her no this is my mom when she was

172
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:33,520
in college in the late 1960s but at the

173
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:36,099
time in the late 1960s in Michigan women

174
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,320
were only allowed to be three things you

175
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,720
could be a teacher

176
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,390
secretary bar nurse that was it that was

177
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,740
your options my mom was really into

178
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,960
mathematics she loves advanced

179
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,940
mathematics she wanted to go be a rocket

180
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,090
scientist like an actual like put

181
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,590
Rockets on the moon rocket scientist but

182
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:56,320
her options were teacher secretary or

183
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,239
nurse so she said alright I'll be a

184
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,780
teacher but I'm not going to stop there

185
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,580
so through her Court through the course

186
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,489
of her career as a teacher she found out

187
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,930
about something called FIRST Robotics if

188
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,210
you haven't heard of it it's robotics

189
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,270
competition for high schoolers where you

190
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:17,169
build robots to solve practical

191
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,880
real-life challenges this is my mom a

192
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:20,740
couple years ago with the robot that

193
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,210
they built that year I have absolutely

194
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,630
no idea what the robot is supposed to be

195
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:28,599
doing but it's a robot it did things but

196
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:31,330
my mom got there because she didn't let

197
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,039
anybody say you can't she thought she

198
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,079
learned to ask yourself how are you

199
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,669
going to make it happen she didn't just

200
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,280
say well I'm gonna be a teacher that's

201
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:42,280
it I don't get to do anything cool she

202
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:46,410
went out and she found a way to become

203
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,410
an award-winning roboticist

204
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,600
so this has applied beyond just getting

205
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,850
me to South Korea I in my career I

206
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,230
mentioned I started out as getting a

207
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,899
screenwriting degree at Vancouver Film

208
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:03,459
School which is fine and dandy

209
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:05,420
except I graduated film school in 2004

210
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,899
used in the movies that were coming out

211
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:13,910
in 2004 you will notice the volume -

212
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:16,730
Shrek 2 sequel book adaptation no new

213
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,589
properties no anything new and exciting

214
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,930
Hollywood didn't want screenwriters so I

215
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:23,240
needed to get a job to support myself so

216
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,680
I got a job at little office you've ever

217
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,420
been in a law office you might have seen

218
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,519
these rows of books these are the laws

219
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,569
the case files the things that lawyers

220
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,860
need to study in order to do their jobs

221
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,680
they don't want to have to reprint these

222
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,199
every time the laws get updated because

223
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,550
that would be a lot of reprinting so the

224
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:42,649
way they do it is those are three-ring

225
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,599
binders and they just print the pages

226
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,850
with the new laws you take out the old

227
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,860
pages you stick in the new ones so I was

228
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,040
doing that one summer and at this law

229
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,569
office job and I was reading the pages

230
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,010
that I was putting in these new laws and

231
00:09:53,569 --> 00:10:02,209
this was in 2005 and these laws in

232
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:04,819
Michigan in 2005 were just acknowledging

233
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,199
the computers existed now that she could

234
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,699
do anything with them not the cybercrime

235
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:11,240
existed not that any of that existed

236
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:15,979
just that computers existed in 2005 and

237
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,959
I said that's ridiculous uh-hum somebody

238
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,819
should do something about that and then

239
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,079
I thought about it I was like well I

240
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,620
have a screenwriting degree what can I

241
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,560
do about it

242
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:28,490
but then I asked myself how am I going

243
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,410
to make it happen so I researched and I

244
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,510
discovered that computer forensics

245
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,360
technology forensics is a place where

246
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:38,480
the law and technology come together

247
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,550
very closely and I found a school that

248
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,870
offered a group a degree in computer

249
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,040
forensics and I graduated a second time

250
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,560
with a degree in computer forensics

251
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,930
because I didn't want to stay put I

252
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,779
asked myself how am I going to make it

253
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,609
happen so when you come across a problem

254
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:59,089
in your life something that you see this

255
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,830
isn't right this needs to be fixed and

256
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,930
you say you know maybe I don't have

257
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:06,470
the skills or maybe like I'm too young

258
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,670
or maybe maybe maybe maybe don't just

259
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,100
let it go

260
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:14,120
ask yourself how am I gonna make it

261
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:18,110
happen the second thing that I learned

262
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,820
is go look it up when I was a kid little

263
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,130
kid learning to read I would go and I

264
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,020
would ask my dad when I found a word

265
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,470
that I didn't understand and he would

266
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:29,780
always tell me go look it up

267
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,030
now I'm old enough that when my dad said

268
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:36,140
go look it up he meant in a dictionary

269
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,959
or worse an encyclopedia if you're old

270
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,310
like me you probably remember these and

271
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,440
how tricky it could be you had to hope

272
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,930
that the dictionary was up-to-date

273
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,180
enough that the volume that you needed

274
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:52,040
in the encyclopedia was not checked out

275
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,780
of the library or just missing even as I

276
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,640
got older I went to high school these

277
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,780
this is the search engines that I was

278
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,370
dealing with in high school this is what

279
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,530
it looked like before Google I couldn't

280
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:04,460
pull out my phone I couldn't say hey

281
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:07,880
Google or hey Siri and ask for help I

282
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:13,700
had to look it up in a dictionary or an

283
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:15,890
encyclopedia or in the library now I it

284
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,530
seems like a very mundane skill let's

285
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,890
open a dictionary look it up but if

286
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:24,079
you've ever provided tech support for

287
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,500
your technologically challenged friends

288
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,090
and family you've done something similar

289
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,180
if you don't read an xkcd first off you

290
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,590
should it's a very good comic but this

291
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:38,329
is a comic that they printed a couple

292
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:40,340
years back where I it's the tech support

293
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:43,190
flow for people who are providing tech

294
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:46,400
support to friends and family which is

295
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,710
basically we don't know every program

296
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,660
out there you know mom if you call me up

297
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,920
and you say how do I use this random I

298
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,500
don't know this write in a program

299
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,050
I really don't what I do know is I know

300
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,670
how to look for a button that probably

301
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,910
will do what I want and I know to push

302
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:04,490
it and see what happens and if it worked

303
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,980
fantastic I fixed the problem and if not

304
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:11,900
I know how to keep looking I know how to

305
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,939
go on Google and say Google tell me how

306
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:17,598
to do this thing in

307
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:20,419
program I know how to read to find and

308
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:21,829
to read the help manuals in programs so

309
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:23,929
I don't have to know every program

310
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:27,289
that's out there I just have to know how

311
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:30,470
to look it up this has been very

312
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:32,569
valuable in my professional career when

313
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:36,169
I went and got my computer forensics

314
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:38,238
degree I had one whole class in UNIX and

315
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:40,879
Linux it was not a very good class the

316
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:44,449
instructor put a few man pages on some

317
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:46,639
powerpoints and read them to us in a

318
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:49,998
dark room it was very boring but when I

319
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,619
went and got my first job they my first

320
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:54,589
day they came and they said to me do you

321
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:57,439
know any UNIX or Linux and I said well I

322
00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:00,109
took one class in college but they said

323
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:01,819
great nobody else knows anything about

324
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:08,659
UNIX and Linux your Unix Linux Esprit

325
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:10,878
now and I was like so I could have said

326
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:13,699
no I don't know anything I can't do that

327
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:16,099
I could have but this was my first day

328
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:18,439
on the job my first job out of college I

329
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:21,529
don't want to look bad so I said all

330
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:24,228
right I'm gonna go look it up and I went

331
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:28,159
and I researched I read man pages I went

332
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:29,779
on Stack Exchange and I found other

333
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,669
questions other things that people had

334
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:34,609
asked and I figured out how to do it and

335
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:37,159
I actually became our offices unix linux

336
00:14:34,609 --> 00:14:39,559
expert other people came to me with

337
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:42,319
questions and i was able to answer them

338
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,988
because i looked it up it happened again

339
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:48,829
when I moved from Boeing to Google

340
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:51,649
Google uses a lot of MacBooks and part

341
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:55,189
of Google's security process is to read

342
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:57,339
the Macbook logs to generate security

343
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:59,358
alerts if something looks weird but

344
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:03,559
nobody on the security team knew

345
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:06,229
anything about Mac logs I just everybody

346
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,779
knew Linux syslog but not Mac logs cuz

347
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:12,859
it's similar but different enough to be

348
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:16,939
a problem and so all of our parsers the

349
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:18,799
parsers are the the code that reads

350
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:21,529
through the logs and pulls out things

351
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,089
that you might want an alert on they

352
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,649
were all broken because nobody knew

353
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,320
anything about Mac logs and nobody knew

354
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,700
how to fix them so I could have said

355
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,440
I don't know anything about Mack logs

356
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,540
I'm not gonna touch those everybody else

357
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,080
on my team had said the same thing that

358
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,839
was why the parsers were so broken but I

359
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,930
said we need those alerts so I'm gonna

360
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:44,030
look it up and I did I figured out how

361
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,760
to parse Mack logs I fixed all of our

362
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:50,329
parsers and I became the Mack logs

363
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:53,360
expert on our team so something

364
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:56,210
important to note aside from just going

365
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,400
to look something up is that it's okay

366
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,100
to ask these questions it's okay to mean

367
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,610
to look something up you cyber security

368
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,710
is a massive field no one person can

369
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,720
know everything in it it's not possible

370
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,660
you can't hold that much information in

371
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,480
your head and you shouldn't have to you

372
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,579
should be able to say I don't know but

373
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,520
I'm gonna look it up I don't know but

374
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:22,430
I'm gonna ask somebody that's why we

375
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,620
have teams because we can't do

376
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,810
everything all on our own you need to

377
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,340
have people who know a lot about this

378
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,229
thing and somebody else who knows a lot

379
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,510
about that thing you work together and

380
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,430
then that way you can ask each other you

381
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:38,870
can support each other and get your

382
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:41,359
questions answered the third thing that

383
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,800
I've learned over the course of my

384
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,660
career is a little bit more abstract

385
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,939
it's I have an opportunity for you

386
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,770
now you are almost never going to have

387
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,570
somebody walk up to you and just say I

388
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,480
have an opportunity for you it doesn't

389
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,550
work like that but it happens and you

390
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,010
have to listen for it they're not gonna

391
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:04,490
say those words but it'll be happening

392
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:07,189
anyway now sometimes you will get lucky

393
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,990
sometimes you know Jedi Master qui-gon

394
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:11,000
will swoop down on his ship out of the

395
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,770
sky and see how awesome you are at pod

396
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,980
racing and sweep you out of your Monday

397
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,230
and life and you go be a Jedi if that

398
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,170
happens fantastic you're super lucky and

399
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:24,170
take advantage of it more often than not

400
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:27,770
though you're gonna have to go way out

401
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:29,900
of your way work really hard to convince

402
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,670
somebody that they have an opportunity

403
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,940
for you you're gonna have to show them

404
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,860
why you're why you deserve this

405
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,720
opportunity you have to show them that

406
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,949
you're ready you have to convince them

407
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,050
to give it to you

408
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,850
and I've had a few times in my life

409
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:49,480
where people have given me an

410
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,280
opportunity the first was my senior year

411
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,620
of college when I was getting my

412
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,810
forensics degree my class participated

413
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,409
in the collegiate cyber defense

414
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:01,629
challenge which is a Red Team Blue Team

415
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,090
exercise if you don't know what a Red

416
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,280
Team Blue Team exercises you have the

417
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,600
red team who are the attackers the bad

418
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,000
guys trying to break into your system

419
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,090
you have the blue team which was us the

420
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,110
student teams defending your network but

421
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:18,580
the CCDC added in an extra wrinkle they

422
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,899
added in something they called the white

423
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,780
team which was the white collar

424
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:26,220
executives of the company that as a blue

425
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:29,680
team you were defending and you had to

426
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,850
sometimes stop your defense or one

427
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,310
person would stop the defense everybody

428
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:35,350
else would keep going and go and present

429
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:38,110
to the white team the white team might

430
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,760
come and say we want you to upgrade all

431
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,250
of our servers to the newest operating

432
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,070
system right now or they might say we

433
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,660
want to install retina scanners on all

434
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,470
of our laptops because we saw it in the

435
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,760
matrix and it was really cool and you

436
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:56,980
would have to go and explain why that

437
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,750
might not be the best idea but because I

438
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,820
had theater background because I had

439
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,400
gone and got my screenwriting degree I

440
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,379
was less afraid to get up in front of

441
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,530
the white team as everybody else on my

442
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,510
team so I got to go do it and so I made

443
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,240
all these presentations to the white

444
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,440
team and after the competition was over

445
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,530
one of the men who'd been on the white

446
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,960
team came up to me and he said I work at

447
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:22,990
Boeing you really impressed me I want

448
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,700
you to come work for me and I was

449
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,410
shocked good for one I didn't know that

450
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,060
Boeing did anything other than airplanes

451
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,990
turns out they have a very extensive

452
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:34,840
cyber security division and I said all

453
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,530
right so I applied I did the interview

454
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:43,419
and a few months later I was working at

455
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:47,020
Boeing it happened again when I switched

456
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:49,810
over to Google I started at Google on

457
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:53,250
the security team but Google has a lot

458
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:54,870
of internal forums where employees

459
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,690
we'll talk about new policies new

460
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,969
features ideas things like that and I

461
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,150
was a very vocal supporter of privacy

462
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,650
for users on these forums new people

463
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,820
would say hey I've got this idea for a

464
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,150
future and I would say you know how are

465
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,010
you gonna protect user privacy and one

466
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,290
day out of the blue I got an email from

467
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:16,020
a manager on the privacy team and he

468
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:18,030
said I'm starting a new privacy

469
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,680
engineering team and I want you to be on

470
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:24,810
it because I've seen how vocal you are

471
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:27,300
about privacy now something to keep in

472
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:30,510
mind with these two things in particular

473
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,159
it sounds lucky you know the guy from

474
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,320
Boeing comes up and says I want you to

475
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,070
work for me the guy and the privacy team

476
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,889
says I want you to join my privacy team

477
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:43,139
but if I hadn't gone to the cyber

478
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,840
defense challenge if I hadn't been a

479
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,400
vocal supporter of privacy they wouldn't

480
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,230
have known about me they wouldn't have

481
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,720
seen me they wouldn't have had that any

482
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,980
idea that I existed I had to put myself

483
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,670
out there I had to create that

484
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,480
opportunity for myself and when I did

485
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:04,170
people came up to me and gave it to me

486
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:08,250
the third time this was my go see Yoda

487
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:11,700
and a gabba experience once I joined the

488
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:13,440
privacy team at Google I noticed that we

489
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,730
were doing a lot of really cool things

490
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,920
with privacy and security at Google but

491
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,110
we weren't talking about them Google

492
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,060
doesn't like to talk externally about

493
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,939
security and privacy for a variety of

494
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,830
reasons but I said you know we're

495
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,630
missing out we should be talking about

496
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,399
this we're doing amazing work in here

497
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,220
and I think people should know about it

498
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,900
and so I went to my manager and I said I

499
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,650
want to talk about Google security and

500
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:44,130
privacy at DEFCON now if you're familiar

501
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:46,620
at all with DEFCON it's a major cyber

502
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,510
security conference but more importantly

503
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,459
it is a conference of hackers who are

504
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:54,720
extremely distrustful of large companies

505
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,670
like Google it was not going to be the

506
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,970
most hospitable place to give a talk

507
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:02,730
about security and privacy at Google and

508
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,540
my manager knew this and he said I think

509
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:07,270
you're nuts

510
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:10,420
but you know what if you want to try it

511
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:13,150
that so I said all right so I went and I

512
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:16,300
talked to Google's lawyers I talked to

513
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:17,950
the PR team I found out what I could say

514
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,580
and what I couldn't say because of laws

515
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:23,290
regulations I talked to other privacy

516
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,460
and security teams and I found out cool

517
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:30,399
things that they were doing and whoops

518
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:35,230
and I got to go talk at DEFCON which was

519
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:38,260
great I came back and another manager at

520
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,360
Google contacted me and she said I was

521
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,730
supposed to talk at this other security

522
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,740
conference but I can't go I want you to

523
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,360
go can you can you take my place because

524
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,800
you just gave this great talk at DEFCON

525
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,169
you have some experience speaking in

526
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:55,560
front of people can you do that and I

527
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:57,580
said sure so I went and I talked and

528
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,980
this was the women in cybersecurity

529
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,870
conference where I got a lot of

530
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,770
attention from recruiters including one

531
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:08,469
from lyft and the recruiter got in touch

532
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:11,590
with me and said we want you on our

533
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:15,580
security privacy team eyelift and I said

534
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:18,300
all right let's do this but again I had

535
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:21,879
to put myself out there I had to

536
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,190
convince my manager to let me talk at

537
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,900
Def Con I had to put the talk together I

538
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,640
had to get it accepted at DEFCON I had

539
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,580
to do all of this work and then I had to

540
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,400
go and do it and do it well enough that

541
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,409
somebody would come and say you did good

542
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,470
I'm gonna give you this extra little

543
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,760
opportunity and it wasn't even much

544
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:43,510
honestly it was just another speaking

545
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,820
engagement but you never know when what

546
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,120
seems like a little opportunity is going

547
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,580
to turn into a big career change so

548
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,979
listen for when people are saying these

549
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,780
things to you listen for where there are

550
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,700
opportunities that you can reach out and

551
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:01,450
make a difference when you see them

552
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,070
fight for them so that's all fine and

553
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,940
dandy it's a lot of stories about my

554
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:10,000
life in my career how does that help you

555
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:13,090
so I want you to think about how are you

556
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,530
going to make it happen your career in

557
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,860
cyber security where do you want to

558
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,820
start there's a ton of cyber security

559
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,809
disciplines

560
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,610
you've got cryptography you've got

561
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,860
tration testing you've got incident

562
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,580
detection in response we've got computer

563
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,709
forensics

564
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,210
you've got malware reverse engineering

565
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,220
and tons more

566
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,429
there are lots and lots and lots of

567
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,879
different areas within cyber security

568
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,740
pick one

569
00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:41,959
ask yourself how are you going to to

570
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,440
become an expert in it and then make it

571
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,100
happen

572
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,529
take classes go to school you don't have

573
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,570
to have a degree I've had managers at

574
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:52,519
Google and elsewhere that don't have a

575
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:55,129
college degree at all it's not required

576
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,850
what's required is that you know what

577
00:24:55,129 --> 00:25:00,100
you're talking about

578
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:04,850
so make it happen go learn educate

579
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:07,629
yourself read about these things which

580
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,619
leads me into my next point look it up

581
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:14,090
when you run into something that you

582
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:19,158
don't know look it up ask questions stay

583
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:22,789
on top of cybersecurity news know what's

584
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:24,529
going on in the cyber space know what

585
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:26,960
attacks are prevalent right now know

586
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:30,200
what companies are worried about know

587
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,389
what's coming up under the radar right

588
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,049
now but that will probably be a problem

589
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:38,469
in a few months or years

590
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:41,090
read books there are books out there on

591
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,009
every aspect of cybersecurity that you

592
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:46,459
can imagine they're very very in-depth

593
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:48,080
books there are very broad books they're

594
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,309
out there some of them are free some of

595
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,119
them are cheap some of them are not so

596
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:56,059
cheap but read them find them and read

597
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,549
them and then go out and put your

598
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:02,090
knowledge to the test

599
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:04,249
cyber camp had a variety of challenges

600
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,639
I'm sure some of you participated in

601
00:26:04,249 --> 00:26:06,230
them

602
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:10,330
the capture the flag challenges and the

603
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:13,190
other ones but there's more out there

604
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,629
find them you know even if you don't

605
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,190
know anything there are ones that are

606
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:18,408
geared towards people who've never done

607
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,869
a capture the flag challenge before

608
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:24,200
there are other challenges like DEFCON

609
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:25,879
darknet which are designed not you know

610
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,980
to beat each other down and get the most

611
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:32,770
points but to learn and teach others go

612
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,090
out and participate in these and

613
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:39,190
these things that you've looked up and

614
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:41,230
taught yourself and finally listen for

615
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,390
when people say I have an opportunity

616
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,360
for you because again they're probably

617
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:49,600
not going to say those exact words to

618
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,639
you they're probably going to it the

619
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,090
opportunity might be there but you'll

620
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,370
have to convince them to give it to you

621
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,379
so going out to conferences like this

622
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,560
you're all here that is a fantastic

623
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,510
start you're here you're meeting people

624
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,440
you're finding out what opportunities

625
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:10,780
you what opportunities exist go to

626
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,480
others these are some of the big names

627
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:16,480
Def Con besides are huge in the cyber

628
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:20,440
space but there's more if you google

629
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:22,210
your country or your local area and

630
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,160
cyber security conference you will

631
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:28,000
probably find one you'll probably find

632
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,680
several some of them are free some of

633
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,270
them aren't free some of them you if you

634
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,270
have an employer already in

635
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:36,190
cybersecurity you can talk your employer

636
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:38,620
into paying for you to go because it's

637
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:41,350
job relevant find a way to do it find a

638
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,060
way to get there and while you're there

639
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:47,439
while you're here

640
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:50,200
meet people talk to people if I hadn't

641
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,270
gone and presented to the white team if

642
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,400
I hadn't talked to the man from Boeing

643
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,410
afterwards if I hadn't talked to my

644
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:00,190
manager if I hadn't put myself out there

645
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:01,840
on the forums at Google I never would

646
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,080
have met the people who could give me

647
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,120
the opportunity so reach out to other

648
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,129
people that are here when you walk out

649
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,050
of here look around you see who's

650
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:13,060
sitting next to you that might be your

651
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:15,340
next coworker your next employee your

652
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,870
next boss the person that you might call

653
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:21,310
the next time your network goes down and

654
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:23,290
you need help get to know the people in

655
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,330
the cyber security space don't just sit

656
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:29,830
at your computer all alone cyber

657
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:31,720
security is a very very social field

658
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,790
believe it or not you need to know

659
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,670
people you need to know who's out there

660
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:38,440
and you need to be able to give them

661
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:41,260
convince them to give you an opportunity

662
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,540
but not just that you need to be ready

663
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,010
for when someone comes up to you and

664
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,049
they say I want you to give me an

665
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,460
opportunity because you might be the

666
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:51,700
person who has the opportunity for

667
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:54,669
somebody else you never know so be out

668
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,580
there be listening for it go meet other

669
00:28:54,669 --> 00:29:00,580
people look up the things that you need

670
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,199
to know and make it happen thank you

671
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:14,029
very much

672
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:17,419
[Applause]

673
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:17,419
any questions

674
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:42,620
here we go hello thank you first of all

675
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:46,320
thank you for your speech it was very

676
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:49,290
inspirational I would like to know why

677
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,919
you decide to switch between boring and

678
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:55,740
Google it was a economic motivation or

679
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:59,520
just you were looking for a new

680
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:01,340
challenge or something thank you sure so

681
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,320
the reason I decided to switch between

682
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,899
Boeing and Google goes into u.s.

683
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,460
politics a little bit if you remember

684
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:13,230
back in 2012 I think it was the US

685
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,210
government the Republicans and Democrats

686
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:18,270
were fighting over budget and they

687
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:19,650
basically said alright we're going to

688
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,620
put something called the sequestration

689
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:25,230
in our budget which is basically if we

690
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:27,179
can't agree on a budget by this date

691
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,640
we're gonna cut funding for everything

692
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:31,830
nobody gets any money and everybody

693
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,330
thought that would be enough to scare

694
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:38,429
people into making a budget but it

695
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:40,010
didn't work so at the end of 2012 the US

696
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:44,660
government's defense budget got

697
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:47,790
drastically cut and Boeing at the time

698
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:49,860
most of their cybersecurity division was

699
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,870
working for the u.s. government so all

700
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,090
of a sudden there was no money to pay

701
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:57,300
Boeing there was no money for any of the

702
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:00,270
Boeing cybersecurity programs so my team

703
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:02,040
got broken up we got out sourced they

704
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,889
were trying to figure out what to do

705
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,300
with all of us and I said you know what

706
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,760
I'm not gonna wait for them to figure

707
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,149
out what to do with me I'm going to

708
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,490
figure out what to do with myself and

709
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:16,890
honestly it was on a whim that I applied

710
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:19,890
to Google I was looking on LinkedIn and

711
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,570
I saw a Google had a job posting for a

712
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,580
security engineer and I said you know

713
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:27,389
I'm never gonna get in but I might as

714
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:33,720
well try see how far I get and oops I

715
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:36,650
got it so yeah that was it was me

716
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,990
deciding that I wasn't going to wait for

717
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,490
Boeing to figure itself out after their

718
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,510
budget got cut I said I'm gonna figure

719
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,510
out what I want to do for myself

720
00:31:44,940 --> 00:32:10,769
I get like an audio corns here great any

721
00:31:52,859 --> 00:32:14,939
other questions hello I'm asking myself

722
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:18,629
one question when you start you were

723
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:23,460
talking about the invisible mode on the

724
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:26,009
Google Hangouts I'm not gonna say this

725
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,549
is true but I've met so memory con

726
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:33,509
people that told me that the social life

727
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:37,739
is not as as big as in other countries

728
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:40,529
and I'm wondering myself if in America

729
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:43,249
for example Facebook Google these

730
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:48,659
companies developed at the social media

731
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:53,309
in internet that maybe it's not the best

732
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:56,429
place to do it I mean if if you have to

733
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:58,820
compare your own personal life and then

734
00:32:56,429 --> 00:33:01,470
put that personal life into a computer

735
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:04,619
maybe there is a problem over there

736
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:07,769
if for example when when you want to

737
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:10,590
stay no one to see you on everything

738
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:14,190
maybe you don't think about this but

739
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:17,149
maybe it can happen in in other terms in

740
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:21,509
facebook for example what do you think

741
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:25,709
so I think that a lot of it is about

742
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:30,899
awareness because you're right no one

743
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:33,570
social media company can like represent

744
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:37,320
me you know I'm I don't have facebook

745
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:39,119
personally but like my Twitter profile

746
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,119
isn't all of me it's it's my

747
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:46,259
professional profile the other social

748
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:48,238
media that I use they're not everything

749
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:51,509
a part of me and that's that's very

750
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:54,989
human humans are never all of ourselves

751
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:56,559
to everybody in exactly the same way all

752
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:58,630
the time

753
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,769
we compartmentalize we interact

754
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:01,809
differently with different people you

755
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:04,179
know you're you're going to act

756
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:07,539
differently around your grandmother for

757
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:13,060
example then around your girlfriend or

758
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:15,489
boyfriend and I think as consumers it's

759
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,770
really important to understand where

760
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,598
those dividing lines are it might mean

761
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:22,119
that you have different social media

762
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:25,119
profiles because you know if you're on

763
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:26,710
Facebook and your grandmother and your

764
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,409
girlfriend or boyfriend are on the same

765
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,790
feed it's a little awkward because how

766
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,690
do you be your true self to your

767
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,320
grandmother and your

768
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:38,440
boyfriend/girlfriend at the same time

769
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,089
part of it is also making it known to

770
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,129
the companies that make these social

771
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:44,440
media products that we want this ability

772
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:45,790
to compartmentalize so facebook is a

773
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,070
good example of this you know people

774
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:50,079
said we don't want everybody to see

775
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,639
everything all the time and they've

776
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,730
implemented ways you can say you know

777
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,679
only let this group of people see this

778
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:59,940
post or only let this group of people

779
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,710
see this part of me it's not perfect yet

780
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,329
it's still it's actually it feels like

781
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:07,329
Facebook has been there forever but it's

782
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:09,910
really not that old what 10 15 years I

783
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:11,920
don't remember but you know not that old

784
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:15,009
and so these companies are learning and

785
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,839
they're listening they they want you to

786
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,069
use their services but that means that

787
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:21,220
they have to make a service that you

788
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:23,259
want to use and so you have to if

789
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,868
there's something that's missing from

790
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:28,450
one of these social media sites that

791
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:31,150
will help you better represent yourself

792
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,770
in a way that makes sense to you and to

793
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,990
the people that you're representing

794
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,579
yourself to then you need to tell the

795
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:38,560
companies this you need to make it known

796
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:47,680
that this is what you want so that they

797
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:50,680
know to build it any other questions

798
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:56,980
all right thank you very much

799
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,980
[Applause]
