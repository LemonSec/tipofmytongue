1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:09,780
hello can you hear me yes right please

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:12,030
hands up thank you nah so first of all

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,129
thank you all for being here thank you

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,378
and save it for your kind invitation to

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,619
be at this conference it is the first

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:23,189
time around in my first time around in

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,849
nan my first time at cyber camp and I'm

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:31,529
happy let's focus on the topic for today

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:35,899
I know the name of my presentation is

10
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,910
quite a general in scope but before I

11
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:40,590
move on I would like to ask you a

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,959
question to start interaction with you

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:51,050
hands up hands up who thinks at some

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,050
point you your company has been hacked I

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:01,050
guess 40-person hands lamp for

16
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:03,329
cybersecurity especially about offensive

17
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,420
side that's what I'm focusing on we have

18
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,320
this like motive there are two kinds of

19
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,320
companies or governments in the world

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,080
those have been cracked all those who

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,939
have not yet found out so those who

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,450
didn't raise your hand sixty percent

23
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,449
maybe you haven't heard it has happened

24
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,640
so this recently been a change in the

25
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,829
government's in the companies to try and

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,380
understand this concept where we've all

27
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,899
been hacked one way or another one of

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,240
the main problems we encounter is that

29
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:44,280
we are asking Ross wrong questions often

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,890
when we get hacked we say we've been

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,130
hard but to what extent this is a very

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:55,920
difficult question because the answer is

33
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:57,509
everything we need to understand that if

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,469
we've been hacked we've been fully

35
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:06,049
hacked the worst way to reveal a hack

36
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:08,579
server is to rebuild it this idea that

37
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,590
antivirus companies saying that there

38
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,720
was a virus coming in i use the

39
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,700
antivirus and it cleanses out

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,850
if it is does it matter of the past

41
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,390
maybe a virus because it's a program

42
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,890
with F specific function but as these

43
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,410
fires start communicating with the

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,630
internet to get commands and we still

45
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,910
don't know what those commands are we

46
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:34,049
don't know what's going on in our system

47
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:37,140
we can have forensic analysis yes but as

48
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:41,160
I see it is far from science and is not

49
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:44,100
fully accurate so first idea take-home

50
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,930
message if we get hacked we need to

51
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,200
rebuild there's no way to know to what

52
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:52,530
extent we've been hacked this is me Nico

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:58,679
Iceland I've been introduced this is one

54
00:02:52,530 --> 00:03:02,910
of my hubs Brazilian citizen this is my

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,580
second passion tea cyber security and it

56
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,579
is closely related to cybersecurity by

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,640
the way the fact that this is a note

58
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,150
with the techniques surpasses strength

59
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:20,190
and this is meaningful for hacking

60
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:24,930
through technique one single haka can

61
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:28,320
break into a billion worth multi billion

62
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,610
worth company and ruin it and this is

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,709
part of what we are going to discuss

64
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:38,180
here but before that never in this

65
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:42,060
concept this is a latin sentence meaning

66
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:46,920
whoa from everyone to everyone this is

67
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:50,640
by hoppes that he wrote the levy livia

68
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:54,208
son where he discusses that before we

69
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,260
had the civil society there was the

70
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:02,209
natural state as it as it is cold

71
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,209
weather were individuals each of whom

72
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:12,060
they could do anything cause anything on

73
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:14,040
an another individual in so far as they

74
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,190
can as this allows them to preserve

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,370
their rights so it's a war of everyone

76
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,789
against everyone everyone turning on

77
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,560
everyone and this is what's happening on

78
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:30,800
the internet right now

79
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,190
it's about how many windows XP and up on

80
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:39,560
the internet within two minutes it'll be

81
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:42,229
hacked but it's not just a warm or as

82
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,030
simple as that a warm would be one of

83
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:46,340
the basic things we need to be protected

84
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:50,150
against is not a problem anymore we've

85
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,638
been hacked with a warm we have much

86
00:04:50,150 --> 00:05:01,780
more a conceptual problem than a

87
00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:05,419
security problem but then this warm

88
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:09,080
fully connected to the Internet Skip's

89
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:11,719
attacking us but the warm again it's the

90
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,440
simplest side of security then their

91
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,020
states government then have much more

92
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,949
complicated operations going on the

93
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:25,909
internet from which you cannot be

94
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:28,220
protected virtually and it problem is

95
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:31,880
there is no legal framework and probably

96
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,699
there never be one on the internet so it

97
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,169
is very difficult to protect the result

98
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:41,750
from a tox it it may seem that the state

99
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:45,320
should come and protect me from computer

100
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:48,650
attacks but what if what happens happens

101
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,490
elsewhere coming from Thailand there's

102
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,380
no way for the state to come and help me

103
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:57,620
maybe internally that would be possible

104
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:01,039
spain with in spain this is also

105
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,870
panished but it in happens in other

106
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,449
countries and there is a much more

107
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,240
complicated legal framework and it takes

108
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:12,849
so much effort that it over simples hack

109
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,849
it makes no sense but it is fun either

110
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,360
everyone against everyone right but if

111
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,090
you come and see and think conceptually

112
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:27,130
the internet was built in the US with

113
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:30,318
india of protecting themselves against

114
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:32,990
nuclear attacks so that's the source of

115
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,240
the internet let's build avatar an ad

116
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,620
networks so in case of a nuclear attack

117
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,180
we preserve our communications and yet

118
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,330
when it moved to the private sector and

119
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,880
we have individual users it's become a

120
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,669
network that it's vulnerable to toasters

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,490
connected to the Internet you say they

122
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:58,539
print the weather on your test every

123
00:06:51,490 --> 00:07:02,100
morning and this is quite a problem so

124
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,440
everything is connected to the internet

125
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,410
and this is cultural actually all

126
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,740
devices get locked on the Internet so

127
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:14,979
this is a beautiful kitchen and I set up

128
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,720
things I can conceptually or

129
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,900
metaphorically would be the same as

130
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,310
getting a pool of hooligans all the way

131
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:28,020
into the kitchen and why is that because

132
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:30,910
these are devices that are easily hacked

133
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:34,030
have you heard Banda me right have you

134
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,250
heard of over that medium a boot a

135
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,440
botnet about net you don't know where it

136
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,960
is coming from I need attacks you and

137
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,750
that's the simplest part of security

138
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,900
that would be username and password so

139
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,690
devices all over the internet and you

140
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,880
see the ad admin admin that's the

141
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,639
password does the user word it's been

142
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:57,310
for 30 years so let's build up a botnet

143
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,479
network and make profit out of fate and

144
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:04,260
that's what's going on with us now

145
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:10,539
somehow we are in finding Lenin

146
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:14,050
hooligans empty kitchen our home letting

147
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:15,639
them in touro home but let me talk to

148
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:22,900
you about talk to you about twenty

149
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:29,050
sixteen when it comes to interstate

150
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:33,689
security 2012 abroad us stack net do you

151
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:38,890
know it later on I will refer to it that

152
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:41,800
way we understand that anything in the

153
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:45,580
world whether it is connected or not to

154
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:51,060
the Internet can be hacked and then at

155
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:54,970
the concept change again and that is

156
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:58,839
cyber weapons cyber war is not just

157
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,060
through running items it's ghost or it's

158
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:05,829
based on attacking on the information

159
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:08,109
let let me dwell on that fat am in order

160
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:11,979
to conceptualize it further cyber

161
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:14,890
security is not just floating items your

162
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,829
seams that are hacked but it is based on

163
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:19,870
information and why is that if you

164
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:25,479
attack of information your attack on

165
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:32,170
society itself so a group of ideas a

166
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:34,959
culture so different countries

167
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,819
understood that even there is a need to

168
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,920
attack that's what needs to be attacked

169
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:42,970
on and this is I guess the message for

170
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,040
2016 let's discuss cyber war we know

171
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:50,500
we've been it's been gone for several

172
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:53,140
years and military speaking they started

173
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,910
to understand that the Internet is a new

174
00:09:53,140 --> 00:10:03,130
demeaning so there were four originally

175
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:06,630
land air water and space and some twenty

176
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:11,079
ten years ago Michael Hayden former

177
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:15,520
director of NSA and CIA explained that

178
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:18,790
the internet from now onwards would be

179
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,040
the the fifth Dominion in each has

180
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,520
its own specificity it's not the same to

181
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,010
have an a war that it's fought or on air

182
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,970
or on land so there are different

183
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:32,990
features and different elements so the

184
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,200
Internet becomes a Romanian

185
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:38,270
a space where war can happen and it

186
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,420
means a lot there are many implications

187
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,010
we still don't know and understand why

188
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,719
down and I don't think military

189
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,680
themselves understand what it is that

190
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,730
the Internet is a new domain in but as

191
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:56,510
it is a Dominion it is exchangeable so

192
00:10:52,730 --> 00:11:00,080
if something were to happen at on the

193
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:02,630
internet we can be fought back from a

194
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,830
different Dominion same as regular wall

195
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:11,930
I fight it on land and I can send a bomb

196
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:14,060
from air so it will be a war on the

197
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:23,180
internet but the response can come from

198
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:28,250
somewhere else so the question is what's

199
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:31,670
an act of war on the internet and here

200
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,410
we see a thinker saying a philosopher is

201
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:36,160
an action that discovered out between

202
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,540
the states to penetrate computers or

203
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,449
networks in the different estate in

204
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:47,779
order to cause for all for the purposes

205
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:51,620
of food causing damage or disruption the

206
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:56,600
water extend damage is an act of war how

207
00:11:51,620 --> 00:12:00,020
can a server for the NSA or NASA is it

208
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,570
an act of war the DD blows of the map or

209
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:09,649
publish in someone's emails on the

210
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:13,520
internet so an act of war has this

211
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:15,350
original definition as a doctrine in

212
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,899
every country or so it can be an active

213
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:22,970
adapt it but there is general there's no

214
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:27,260
general consensus for this either side

215
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:29,180
of it they're different laws an armed

216
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,399
conflict in every country actually

217
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,709
there's one but there's not meant if it

218
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:39,290
does not been specified for the cyber

219
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:42,020
crime it's not been criminalized so far

220
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:46,189
so nice of all everyone against everyone

221
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,640
and no one feels like recognizing a

222
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,770
dream

223
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,439
lies in it specifically and so many

224
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,990
things go on and they can spy and a half

225
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,370
and the lion attacks without a proper

226
00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:01,670
armed response at least so far and there

227
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:05,230
is this idea of cost-benefit there is

228
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:10,400
kind of a cold war on the Internet well

229
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:12,710
they all spy on each other or even have

230
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,569
violent actions on the internet and no

231
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:19,160
one says a word since some extent they

232
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,340
are all carrying out their own

233
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:28,449
operations so you come to think what's

234
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:32,270
my country doing and then that's when

235
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:34,640
the dilemma would be is it not is it ok

236
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:37,490
do you have cyber weapons and use them

237
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:42,170
but let's see the features of this cyber

238
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:48,710
war one of which is that it is suppose

239
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:52,849
that arms are kinetic meaning that have

240
00:13:48,710 --> 00:14:00,980
a physical effect something will end up

241
00:13:52,850 --> 00:14:07,550
blowing up the what would first example

242
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:12,080
week comes from 1892 Russia but gas

243
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:18,859
pipelines through Europe or Siberia I'm

244
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:20,870
not sure and the sovereign has been

245
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,690
tampered with by a different country and

246
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:28,450
at some point those line gas so the

247
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,740
guidelines pipelines Leo blew up in 1919

248
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,140
which was quite a financial financial

249
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:38,150
problem because they had to rebuild the

250
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:40,699
spy planes and they had to check every

251
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,800
pipe and every software because once

252
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:48,950
again could have been modified and blow

253
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:53,449
up again so this was a first Connecticut

254
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:56,660
hack that was based on virtuality or

255
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,520
programming we will see next and another

256
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,069
larger example

257
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:06,290
but I I guess this is the first example

258
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:08,360
in history and as I said not everything

259
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,880
is about blowing things up when we think

260
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,830
of kinetic we think of this explosions

261
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,970
but there are others I will not refer to

262
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:19,700
you but I guess this would be the one

263
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:26,200
someone sit in type in into their

264
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,200
computer but genetic is more like this

265
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:33,949
spine coming in getting information and

266
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,099
take inside information somewhere where

267
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,140
you can make profit out of it and you

268
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,790
can expose it or not but you make profit

269
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:57,610
out of it the sports kinetic about cyber

270
00:15:43,790 --> 00:16:00,380
war then attribution is also large at

271
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:04,910
significant in the on the internet

272
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:07,580
attribution it means who attacked me and

273
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,189
it is very difficult on the internet

274
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:15,050
especially in real life you might

275
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:18,740
remember better than me the itachi bump

276
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,329
attack and here in in spain and who was

277
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,700
attributed to at first and who was

278
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,070
actually the perpetrator and this is

279
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,500
often the case on the internet because

280
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,480
they come from different IP addresses so

281
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,580
coming from china and that means that it

282
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,980
was china that attacked as or Russia

283
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,170
they were the ones attacking us and

284
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,540
things are not so straightforward it's

285
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:42,949
also very interconnected as a matter of

286
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:47,180
fact it is done on purpose it is a false

287
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:49,610
flag attack as it is known where I

288
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:54,310
specifically attack you from China so

289
00:16:49,610 --> 00:17:00,590
that you think it was China's people and

290
00:16:54,310 --> 00:17:08,290
I push conflict up into China in your

291
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:10,420
country but

292
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:13,389
is the same way as with a bump it is

293
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:17,020
very complicated once a block bump went

294
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:19,870
off and you try to rearm it you see here

295
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,220
it said made in Russian so how do we

296
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:27,149
really know whether it was made in

297
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,150
Russian so generally what's done here is

298
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,910
further analysis trying to understand

299
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,790
context and exchange ideas so I'll use

300
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:39,510
or domain dominions so i will just

301
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:43,810
intelligence not just on the internet

302
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:46,690
but crying and the son who is behind the

303
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,810
attack sometimes it's very obvious it

304
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:54,130
happens to specific times of windows of

305
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:56,560
opportunity that we know exists it if

306
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,990
you really know a bit of international

307
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,840
politics but problem is when it goes

308
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:05,620
down to law enforcement level when comes

309
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:08,399
please officer and says my company has

310
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:13,840
been hacked so this was the IP address

311
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:18,550
but for cops for police forces we need

312
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:21,459
to have a hundred percent veracity there

313
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:24,879
will be prosecution and trial so hundred

314
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:29,200
percent certainty and that's what other

315
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:34,990
things are done search warrant and they

316
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:37,000
seized their computer and so one hundred

317
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:41,260
percent deviation that on the internet

318
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,940
it's almost impossible then another

319
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:47,710
interesting topic right which these

320
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:55,600
attacks become even more interesting on

321
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:58,030
the internet asymmetry most books and

322
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:06,070
manuals on the topics say that cyber war

323
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:11,379
is asymmetric which means no matter how

324
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:13,780
big our weaponry we have a small country

325
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,530
with 25 hackers and still they can

326
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,180
attack

327
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:22,910
my networks have gained access to my

328
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:29,110
networks and take down one of my servers

329
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:29,110
and this is true why do we think so

330
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:38,659
because the amount is low so keeping

331
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,629
apples 25 experts is not expensive and

332
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,420
when compared to traditional warfare the

333
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:48,200
price of a drone would be 32 million

334
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:50,870
dollars that were the cheapest airplane

335
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,800
and missiles a hundred thousand per

336
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:57,500
missile so an attack would be very cheap

337
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,530
a cyberattack compared to others have

338
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:03,380
you had a pen test have you been pen

339
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:08,090
tested they will charge you 30 40

340
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:11,110
thousand dollars and in given time they

341
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:14,330
will end up hacking into your servers

342
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,729
there's another like motive in computers

343
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:20,030
so security means that everything can be

344
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:22,820
hacked as long as you have time and

345
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:25,580
money to pay for it so you've got plenty

346
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,310
of money you can buy the necessary

347
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:36,730
people or the necessary bucks to break

348
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:41,270
into a network what about exploit that's

349
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:44,360
where most of the focus is on cyber war

350
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:50,360
none also very expensive either Google

351
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:53,629
for chrome now pays a back bounty there

352
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:56,959
is five thousand dollars per crown back

353
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:59,990
it is to laugh at when you think that

354
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,730
crime is one of the most used so items

355
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,550
at a world level for Ivan's a bit more

356
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:07,240
expensive I guess there's some private

357
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:13,340
companies offering have million dollars

358
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:16,880
for a a back so that you can have shell

359
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,270
break into an iPhone it's good I have a

360
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,470
million dollars i used the underground

361
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,870
and everything else so it's a lot of

362
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,710
money right but a government levels not

363
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:31,110
much money

364
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:34,850
colloquial esto el tanque Ava's you are

365
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:39,360
Nettie go please this our cyber war tank

366
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:40,918
so this is a cheap way out so we want to

367
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,110
talk on an iPhone and maybe have a

368
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:46,409
million dollars it might seem that we

369
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,899
could have it attacked no problem for a

370
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:52,440
specific target right but I guess the

371
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:55,529
main main problem with a symmetric

372
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,200
asymmetric whoa well this is this in

373
00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:03,510
English because this play on words is

374
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:06,299
it's nice you can have access to a

375
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,679
server this is cheap but then being in

376
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:10,860
every server at the same time it's not

377
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:15,240
the same I'm handling that information

378
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:19,500
and that's what's going on it's not just

379
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,960
one attack by one power its powers of

380
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,899
hacking everywhere and that brings us to

381
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:29,789
is stacks net if you haven't heard about

382
00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:36,840
it let me explain the idea here was to

383
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:41,399
prove we can be anywhere not ask but

384
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:44,668
whoever did it that said that it was the

385
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:47,279
US and Israel together and we can meet

386
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:49,440
anywhere no matter where they're

387
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,659
connected or not when I think of a stack

388
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:57,000
snacked I remember first mission

389
00:22:51,659 --> 00:23:00,840
impossible where Tom Cruise well there

390
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,169
is a computer that it's offline and you

391
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:09,539
know to Cruise Tom Cruise he didn't have

392
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:11,580
the money otherwise if he had the money

393
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:14,279
on Mission Impossible one he would have

394
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:19,139
gone with the stack snacks we need to

395
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:21,240
curve a uranium enrichment in in Iran we

396
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,789
have two options throwing a missile on

397
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,710
those plans or coming up with something

398
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:28,460
much far more intelligent and more

399
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,460
expensive of course

400
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:37,599
so there was this warm build aiming at

401
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,599
give a few computers and why is that

402
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:47,179
uranium and rain German plans naturally

403
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:50,710
are not connected to the internet see is

404
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:54,999
a plc's unconnected to some computers

405
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:58,429
that are offline of course why would we

406
00:23:54,999 --> 00:24:00,950
have them online we all feel that we

407
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:03,440
need to have everything online because

408
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:09,820
we feel the need to know what's going on

409
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:13,159
air all the time but here they were not

410
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,309
online so they had to reach them out so

411
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,109
first infected a few computers some

412
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:22,580
people's computers who potentially they

413
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:28,460
knew we'd have access to this uranium

414
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:31,820
enrichment can't the warm stay there

415
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:34,399
sniffing and when they plug in a pen

416
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:39,468
drive it would get infected eventually

417
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:41,869
the owner as we all do if we are offline

418
00:24:39,469 --> 00:24:45,139
we get the pen drive we use it as a

419
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:48,259
network and the pen drive was infected

420
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:50,599
and someone at some point make the

421
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:53,809
mistake of plugging it to the computer

422
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:56,389
that was handling the plans machines and

423
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:58,969
the machines got infected and so they

424
00:24:56,389 --> 00:25:01,699
did something very intelligent we we

425
00:24:58,969 --> 00:25:03,559
should not break it all down because if

426
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,269
we take them all down it would be much

427
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:10,759
more kinetic right so they drift it or

428
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:14,929
increase the Machine rotation slightly

429
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:17,119
and as you can see it was just starting

430
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:20,599
and this was more trial and error

431
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:24,738
processes and the change in rotational

432
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:29,960
speed for uranium cleaning or a brat am

433
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:31,759
brushing meant that well Iranian so stay

434
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,089
like that saying there's something going

435
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,799
wrong but I don't it's our problem

436
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:41,720
something wrong with a hard word our

437
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,139
researches from so Stuxnet was its kind

438
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,110
kinetic attack

439
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:51,410
but it was more kind of an idea concept

440
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:58,169
researchers not a min so much at ad

441
00:25:51,410 --> 00:26:01,950
machines themselves video was to curve

442
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:06,870
the program aiming and ideas with

443
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:08,550
searchers people usually when they hear

444
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:16,110
about starkness that's what they focus

445
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:19,950
on zero day they were four of them for

446
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:23,100
Stuxnet five years back or so they

447
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:27,060
weren't expensive five hundred thousand

448
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:29,010
six hundred thousand dollars or if you

449
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,470
just trained the necessary people and

450
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:33,600
have them working for a couple of years

451
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,680
you could get this vulnerabilities that

452
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:42,179
were not very complex some of which were

453
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:46,320
found elsewhere beyond sac next is taxed

454
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:48,420
not actually when they were all already

455
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,350
in stacks net where they were fun

456
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:55,860
elsewhere but we think of Syria days and

457
00:26:52,350 --> 00:27:01,310
we see that what was expensive about it

458
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:04,590
stagnates was everything be honest fly

459
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:07,050
for drivers signature on Windows they

460
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:10,949
had to steal two certificates for which

461
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:14,070
they had to run a full complex operation

462
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,440
we don't know anything about that there

463
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,780
is no information they realize they've

464
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,950
been hacked when they got information on

465
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,480
tax net and find out what was going on

466
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,380
so two operations that were very

467
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:32,010
complicated they had to get control of

468
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:33,600
plcs and there were Siemens and 4pm see

469
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,850
configuration they don't go over to

470
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,709
Germany and say give me six plcs who are

471
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,709
ye well yes you know I'm the

472
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:47,100
Intelligence Agency at this country no

473
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:50,250
you need to be given entity and having

474
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,870
an Internet in identity for a real

475
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:56,580
company it's not easy at all it's not

476
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:59,699
just about buying an identity and

477
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,830
maybe they will ask while they are

478
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:07,260
trying to do so envelop yellow russia

479
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:09,539
russia and we have canvas and we have so

480
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,250
many experts restrictions because there

481
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:17,580
are many exploits so we need to verify

482
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:19,320
where each country which we're sorry

483
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,490
which country they come from each of

484
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,139
them so clearly its people who realize

485
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,360
this is not a company on sometimes we

486
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,240
get shell companies that have a website

487
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,080
or whatever and these are terrible so

488
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:38,460
this is already a out of of the shell

489
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:42,149
fair and connect product so this people

490
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,639
had to build an identity that had to be

491
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:47,969
trustworthy to some extent and by not

492
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:51,979
just a product but many products and why

493
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:54,240
it's not because when you throw a

494
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,960
sophisticated attack like this it cannot

495
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:02,880
fail ever Baylen means that you're

496
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:05,279
wasting millions down to drain and it's

497
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,620
not just the model but you need to try

498
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,389
out 500 different models and for each

499
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,918
model you need to make sure there is no

500
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:14,639
problem coming up at all because you

501
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:18,809
never know if at a given point any time

502
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:22,110
at the plant changing one PLC for a

503
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:24,960
different brand it might mean that the

504
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:28,469
network crashes down and engineers might

505
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:31,679
wonder why it crashed down and they

506
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:35,010
started to look into it and it all falls

507
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:39,029
apart so fourth element would be keeping

508
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:42,779
access so how can we manage trying to

509
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:45,210
communicate with my tool how can i make

510
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:50,600
sure that i can find the status of the

511
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:50,600
tool how it's doing progress is made

512
00:29:51,490 --> 00:30:02,770
I guess the difference in symmetry would

513
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:04,928
be this targeting finding out who we

514
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,720
need to attack specifically not everyone

515
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:12,010
but attack those that need to be attack

516
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:14,559
NSA or those people we knew that had

517
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,960
access and their many things is not just

518
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,840
size' it is human intelligence as as

519
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,150
well software maintenance on them all

520
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,889
that information that we get not just

521
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:28,390
from Stuxnet but other attacks we need

522
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,070
to preserve information we need to

523
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,350
understand it and sometimes very large

524
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:35,110
information especially when we have

525
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,600
money in the middle or we are we're

526
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:40,209
making into other networks it's lots of

527
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,370
information which takes lots of analysis

528
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:47,320
and what suspensive about it is having

529
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:51,780
the right people to run the analysis we

530
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:58,450
if we say analysis what about WikiLeaks

531
00:30:51,780 --> 00:31:01,720
WikiLeaks Joe WikiLeaks I personally to

532
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:06,370
me but I believe I think it is a cyber

533
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:09,850
weapon which is widely distributed it is

534
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:14,350
very difficult to hack is to attack it

535
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:17,409
or to close it down apparently there was

536
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:20,889
a judge in California who wanted to for

537
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:24,850
be door to close down that's in domain

538
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:27,730
and because it was a bad open it got

539
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:31,059
replicated everywhere really fast so it

540
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:33,790
was just impossible to shut it down so

541
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:37,149
they tried to do everything to shut it

542
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:39,820
down but you will find lots of mirrors

543
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:42,040
through proxies through everything you

544
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:45,240
can think of so it is just impossible to

545
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:49,690
stop and if you can stop it you will get

546
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,809
very many clones so there are very many

547
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:55,450
clones out there and it has an impact

548
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:57,280
not only local impact but also a global

549
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:00,240
impact and what it is Brutus about

550
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,360
WikiLeaks is that ideas are being

551
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:08,860
broken into this is part of the

552
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:12,699
manifesto of Assange and he had the idea

553
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:16,439
that every government or tyranny was is

554
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:20,820
based on conspiration and conspiracy on

555
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:26,409
secrets and they decided to attack that

556
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:28,689
conspiracy that's those secrets and what

557
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:31,299
is most important about WikiLeaks is not

558
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:34,480
that it is just a repository of a stolen

559
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:37,150
documents but also what makes it all the

560
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,539
most important is the wiki side of it

561
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,530
the weakest side of it allows us to

562
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:43,539
analyze that information that

563
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:47,649
information was taken was rightly

564
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:50,860
indexed therefore it puts it in the

565
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:54,039
public domain therefore it opened the

566
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:57,570
doors to the general population and also

567
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:00,190
banned primarily to journalists so every

568
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:03,070
new leak could be accessed by

569
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:09,970
journalists as well as the public in

570
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:14,590
general and bad allowed people to become

571
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:17,860
aware of that information so they're

572
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:20,620
having very many leaks are having a

573
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:24,639
pasted later on and disseminated

574
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:29,379
everywhere and these wikileaks opened

575
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:32,140
the doors to for everyone and then we

576
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:35,850
may wonder what do these leaks come from

577
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:39,340
and this cartoon kind of explains it I

578
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:42,340
was just I found these cookies also

579
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:45,668
these obviously remote and pocket change

580
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:48,908
and then 12,000 new Hillary Clinton

581
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:51,309
emails it seems that they come out of

582
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:54,549
anywhere if we understand that perhaps

583
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:56,590
it is kind of a magic repository and

584
00:33:54,549 --> 00:34:00,070
that is put there by the good citizens

585
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:04,178
but not that's not the case and actually

586
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:10,379
the War II or the battle in civil space

587
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:12,810
this year was won by Russia a big

588
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:17,069
hacking activities

589
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:19,889
this year had the Russians behind it

590
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:22,830
this was like the perfect system they

591
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:29,549
had the only possible and necessary

592
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:31,949
conditions to make these hacking so

593
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:35,490
hacking does not take place in two or

594
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:37,710
three days not at all these operations

595
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:41,609
these operations are not carried out in

596
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:43,770
a couple of days they take years and

597
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:46,260
then they wait until they find the right

598
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:48,630
time to attack and then they you stay

599
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,950
there for a long time so this is the

600
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:53,520
first thing that we'll have to be very

601
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:55,859
clear about they had access they have

602
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,280
had access to that information a long

603
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:00,960
time ago so yes I may have a log there

604
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,390
can i trust that log if you have

605
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,350
compromised my machine I wouldn't trust

606
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:11,150
it but these three significant hacking

607
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:16,100
operations did see the NCC which is the

608
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:20,250
national Democrats Council in the US and

609
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:22,319
then the private emails of Hillary

610
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:25,110
Clinton and also the director of the

611
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,970
campaign all those males were hacked and

612
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:32,820
leaks at the right time and this is come

613
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:36,750
from a disease Russian concept standing

614
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:40,110
for compromised material and this is her

615
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:42,510
disciplined used by Russia as well as by

616
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:49,260
very many other countries for a long

617
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:55,250
time now in 2009 British diplomat was in

618
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:59,880
Russia and out of sorry well there was a

619
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:02,880
video of him within with some

620
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,040
prostitutes and that was leaked and the

621
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,740
same went for another diplomas there was

622
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,900
there was a video of him making

623
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,910
declarations against the US this person

624
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,330
was very much involved in the Ukrainian

625
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:22,649
conflicts and then he had to resign he

626
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:24,569
was proper job so they did exactly the

627
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,080
same thing this time three days before

628
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:31,630
the meeting of the demo

629
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:34,950
Kratz the DNS DNC males were licked lots

630
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:38,920
of information there lots of information

631
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:45,970
so the democratic committee with the NC

632
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:50,080
apparently his to be impartial I could

633
00:36:45,970 --> 00:37:00,540
see that they were siding with Clinton

634
00:36:50,080 --> 00:37:07,029
and not with Sanders and the same also

635
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:09,880
few days before election Hillary

636
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:14,710
Clinton's emails were hacked this was

637
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:19,780
classified information and she was very

638
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:22,870
close to go to court or to be taken to

639
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:25,000
court for handling private or

640
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:28,000
confidential information through your

641
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:39,340
private email that is a big like a leash

642
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:42,400
in the US that was really timely and of

643
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:45,940
course and had repercussions it would be

644
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,800
hmm nonsense to say that Russia has been

645
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,740
responsible for the election results

646
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:58,930
there were very many other conditions

647
00:37:50,740 --> 00:38:01,750
out there as well and we've so we from

648
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:04,839
Argentina we've seen very many crazy

649
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:06,700
conditions around it as well and well

650
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:10,180
what it is important to understand is

651
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,160
that the agenda Oh of the topics that is

652
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,049
being discussed as not only goes through

653
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,200
the media but also calls through these

654
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:20,110
social networks so therefore they knew

655
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,350
that they had to implement an attack

656
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:26,230
there and not only to raise people's

657
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:28,810
awareness but just to give them a topic

658
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:32,710
for conversation so if we are saying

659
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:34,630
that Clinton will be prosecuted that's

660
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,790
what people are starting to discuss

661
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,640
whether she could be eligible for

662
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,710
prosecution or not

663
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,770
and then we started to see interesting

664
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:49,260
things for instance a recipe to cook

665
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:52,170
risotto and also apparently licking

666
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,450
doughnuts in public space cities an

667
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,430
offense to not do it at airports and a

668
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,490
panty there is a mail that says that

669
00:38:56,430 --> 00:39:02,520
ariana grande grande was in the video

670
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:05,310
licking these doughnuts and just because

671
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:12,300
of that she was not allowed to think in

672
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:14,160
a presidential gala dinner well another

673
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:18,150
interesting thing that came out to us

674
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,620
from the WikiLeaks 70 leagues is that

675
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:22,950
Hillary Clinton doesn't know how to

676
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:25,890
handle the fax machine apparently she

677
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:29,730
didn't know what to do there was a well

678
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:34,560
a few males discussing that incident

679
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:36,870
okay so well from what we read it would

680
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,200
seem that fax is as old as this one and

681
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:46,770
then well then other interesting emails

682
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:49,379
take Amy time that DNC row daddy cyber

683
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,690
security of the Democrat Party is very

684
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:54,540
poor and then there are number of men

685
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:58,530
saying no you are not right and then one

686
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:01,500
week later they were hugged and it made

687
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:04,320
me very happy to see that politicians

688
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:09,060
are ordinary people like we are and they

689
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:14,190
also receive spam free travel to Jamaica

690
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:17,730
and photographs of nudes etc and of

691
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:21,930
course this viagra offered that we all

692
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:33,360
get so this makes a politician's more

693
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:35,640
humane and then the director came out

694
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,400
and said the following says of course

695
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,799
this was carried out by the variations

696
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,860
disease a nation to nation attacked and

697
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,660
therefore we will have to respond how is

698
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,270
it going to response progestin now

699
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:51,120
perhaps that will be an Internet

700
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,140
response or not in any case if they

701
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,220
respond they win

702
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:58,049
not respond tomorrow remember these

703
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:02,609
internet attacks take a long time before

704
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:06,420
they are implemented and if the way to

705
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:08,370
do it tomorrow on on top of that we

706
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,530
would also it will also be too obvious

707
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:17,730
and then the Internet has started to

708
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:21,120
make Russia accountable for it and then

709
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:26,570
also very important and now focusing on

710
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:31,410
specific topics we can say that yes if

711
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:33,870
presidential candidate can be hacked we

712
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:36,000
can also be hacked however the problem

713
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:40,710
becomes more and more important when

714
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:49,790
we'd go deeper into it so the chain of

715
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:53,910
supply other than having a secure net

716
00:41:49,790 --> 00:42:00,410
network every time we are using or

717
00:41:53,910 --> 00:42:00,410
introducing a new device we are adding

718
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:09,779
software from a third party and third

719
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,319
party software and devices are not

720
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,920
always secure well we whenever we buy a

721
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:19,290
device we are buying a black box full of

722
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,330
secrets that we are not aware of and

723
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:28,310
especially if this product comes from a

724
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:32,819
third-party country so for some reason

725
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:36,830
haway routers in the US are forbidden

726
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:39,810
they are not used by the military by

727
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:43,770
other agencies I'm surely the reserve

728
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:46,710
reason for it hands well throughout

729
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:52,750
history we've seen several cases several

730
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:55,780
examples I will focus on this one

731
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:58,240
so at the time of the cold world it was

732
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:01,240
discovered that in one of the US

733
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:05,580
embassies there were some electronic

734
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:11,009
typewriters and someone said that any

735
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:16,210
device in God embassy building was just

736
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:21,160
tampered with and that would also it was

737
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:23,470
open to tapping and then they had to

738
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,379
check all the machines all the equipment

739
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:28,629
that had there so they had to do all

740
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:32,020
sorts of things so that Russians could

741
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:35,170
not see that they had detected that that

742
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:38,800
they had that information and then they

743
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:41,410
had to dismantle the machine to take

744
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:45,430
photographs of it to scan it through

745
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:47,980
with x-ray and then to discover what was

746
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:50,680
happening then in the end they found

747
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:54,520
that that typewriter had a small coil

748
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:57,460
and next to the power interrupter power

749
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:05,170
switch Mac no meter I think that's the

750
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:09,910
name of it and then the keyboard stroke

751
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:12,190
a stroke so oh the letters is stroke was

752
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:16,690
distorted magnetically and that

753
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:19,810
information was sent out to Russian

754
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:23,170
facility a transmission was radio

755
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:28,420
transmission and they could see they

756
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:31,510
could compose the message and then when

757
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:33,910
that was discovered they started to

758
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:36,150
create a methodology to understand each

759
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:39,370
and every one of the devices that were

760
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,410
located in sensitive areas and this is

761
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:45,250
about understanding the supply chain and

762
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:47,259
understanding the supply chains one of

763
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,150
the ideas was just to control this chap

764
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,700
nice change was that the goods that were

765
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:55,180
transferred from the US to Russia would

766
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:58,470
not stop anywhere in between in the

767
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:02,440
middle and then this evil 'it's very

768
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:04,779
important to mention here in argentina

769
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,710
when we have national presidential

770
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:12,430
election

771
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:20,890
elections we started to use these e

772
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:24,368
ballots so these panels had an RFD I

773
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:29,859
cheap and we say no no thank you because

774
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:36,550
I can read it remotely but other than

775
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:39,640
that these evil oats was manufactured

776
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:43,210
and supplied by a private company the

777
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:45,250
private company did not allow to did not

778
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:47,830
disclose the software they used a hard

779
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:49,349
work that we never knew about but for

780
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:52,470
some reason there was a Good Samaritan

781
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:54,970
and I would like to thank him for that

782
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:58,480
uploaded part of the code on the

783
00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:01,689
internet it was reading young Python and

784
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,760
they upload it on the internets and me

785
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:07,150
and a group of friends we started to

786
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,849
analyze it and then one of people in the

787
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:14,980
group Alfred Ortega discovered something

788
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:18,520
very interesting these chips well you

789
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:21,040
cast your ballots and that machine then

790
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:24,550
you choose your select your candidate

791
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:28,660
then you just folded the paper into and

792
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:31,619
then put it in the valid case and then

793
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:35,819
there was someone at the other end and

794
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:38,589
counting the votes the thing is that the

795
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:42,910
machine didn't they didn't do a good

796
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:45,009
parsing so you could change the cheap

797
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:47,589
okay from your mobile phone and

798
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:50,290
therefore you could vote the same

799
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:53,320
country that several times so if you

800
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:55,690
went into a boot and reduce the same

801
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,820
string to vote the same candidates as

802
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:00,730
long as you had that string to good

803
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:03,540
cause several votes to that candidate to

804
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:07,119
a given candidate we want politicians

805
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:09,580
companies and the media and no one ever

806
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,730
listened to us and that's the way

807
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:17,589
elections proceeded and what happened

808
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:18,910
diese national level well a group of

809
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:22,150
people

810
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:25,569
including myself went to the Parliament

811
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:29,770
and we took this question over there and

812
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:32,410
they forbid it there for a valid was

813
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:36,220
with drum was not used for the national

814
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:38,440
election that we had this year first so

815
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:42,160
what it is most recommended is to go

816
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:45,069
back to pen and paper whether we know

817
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,259
more sophisticated means or not okay let

818
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:51,788
me share this with you this is beautiful

819
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:56,230
these can only be happen in Twitter so

820
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:58,630
let us add an IDs and this happens in to

821
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:01,150
it also happens in companies I know how

822
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:03,309
to fix my security Oh to have to bring

823
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:05,170
security to my company kind of an idea

824
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:08,710
is kind of looking like this or like

825
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:11,740
that and this is the problem this is the

826
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:14,260
problem we won't fix everything with

827
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:17,848
external product with fire world with

828
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:21,789
ideas but the issue the concept of

829
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:25,480
perimetry security is dead so the

830
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:27,880
infinite when even if not attacked will

831
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,640
people will have access to it raise your

832
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:33,339
hands those of you who have heard about

833
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,500
an antivirus stopping a zero-day that

834
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:37,750
has never happened to sing it and ideas

835
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:41,589
stopping at zero day didn't happen again

836
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:44,049
either and then well then investigators

837
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:48,279
found a vulnerability and understood

838
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:51,970
while fail yes that may happen but ideas

839
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:55,690
is or avis never do not stop zero days

840
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:59,379
real time as they happen so therefore we

841
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:04,210
have to stop trusting that and to put

842
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:09,299
all our hopes on external and products

843
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:13,029
because perimeter security is dead

844
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:15,970
danger is in our network we have to be

845
00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:17,799
very clear about that what do you do to

846
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,750
defend yourself well to defend yourself

847
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:22,569
the first thing you have to do is to

848
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:25,390
understand it because who controls the

849
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:29,020
network the owner of the network whether

850
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:32,440
it is us or our IT team if the attacker

851
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:34,900
is the owner or the controller of the

852
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,329
work we are in deep trouble so therefore

853
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:39,819
we have to well we know that we have

854
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:42,579
defensive security but we really need to

855
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:44,950
understand offensive security well

856
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:48,310
defensive security sometimes it is

857
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:51,460
arranged in silos it is well we have in

858
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:53,319
small networks so that that is our

859
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,420
understanding of them we want to

860
00:49:53,319 --> 00:49:57,250
simplify them as much as possible simply

861
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:59,050
the simplification of things is always

862
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:02,410
good but however we should not forget

863
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:04,869
about the big picture if we understand

864
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:07,210
the entirety of our network we will be

865
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:10,810
fully understanding because the devil is

866
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:13,680
always in the details and because our

867
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:20,950
attackers are aware of all the possible

868
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:24,220
complexities so well if they come and

869
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:29,200
attack us with a mean of course I too

870
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:31,689
have I cannot do anything at all and

871
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,029
also very important that very much

872
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:36,550
benefited the worlds of securities such

873
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:39,220
as liners and Microsoft it instead of

874
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:42,849
fixing all the security issues which is

875
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:46,240
just impossible to just cannot catch up

876
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:49,540
we all we are all humans we all make

877
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,089
errors so they decided to produce the

878
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:53,980
most expensive exploit and how did they

879
00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:57,339
do that how do you do the most expensive

880
00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:00,700
one well you do that by complicating

881
00:50:57,339 --> 00:51:06,279
more and more the exploding media then

882
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:09,520
al sr and vr p started and came in

883
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:12,640
making it all the more complicated Elda

884
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:15,400
more difficult for new entrants that

885
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:20,980
want to exploit something and then for

886
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:23,140
us we should start thinking how what

887
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,780
would you want to do in your network to

888
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,710
make it more expensive for attackers so

889
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:34,200
we should stop thinking about exploits

890
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:36,880
IDS's we know that do not work there for

891
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,189
the rest of what I said before what is

892
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:44,260
sitting what is most expensive for an

893
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:45,000
attacker staying or spending time in my

894
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:47,610
net

895
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,150
work or what that's what we want to test

896
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:53,400
we'll have to look into persistence is

897
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:56,550
there anything persistent in my machine

898
00:51:53,400 --> 00:52:01,770
that is communicating in an AC chronic

899
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:03,870
manner so connect back I exploit

900
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:05,910
something and there is a connection that

901
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:08,910
comes back to me that doesn't exist

902
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:10,950
anymore that is obsolete filtration if

903
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:14,160
it is in my network that's for something

904
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:16,350
exfiltration as filtration information

905
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,060
will come out of my network can we

906
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:20,400
detect how information is being

907
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,750
exfiltrated many companies already

908
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,580
thinking about that we work for

909
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,590
financial companies will have a specific

910
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:28,890
service for that we refer to it as

911
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:30,570
adversary's simulation I'm saying that

912
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,640
disease of a service but you can do it

913
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:34,800
yourselves in your network you have to

914
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,420
start thinking about that and using some

915
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,420
tools there are some of the chef's tools

916
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:42,780
for that and they are also free tools of

917
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:46,710
there so the idea is not even only to do

918
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:49,920
any to pen test Network you give me

919
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:53,550
three different solution and then I

920
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,590
introduce and implants then that implant

921
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:58,590
would allow me to do lateral movements

922
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:03,150
or sideways movement so we do a

923
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:05,550
coordinated exercise so we as well as

924
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:09,000
the person in charge of it and we start

925
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:11,550
doing it by in a very very silent manner

926
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:16,020
we take out manner in a very very silent

927
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:18,390
manner reduced dns ICMP you take a look

928
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,700
at to do another governmental issues you

929
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:24,720
know that they use a typical protocols

930
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:27,600
because a TCP connection is no longer

931
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,169
useful for instance sometimes I can send

932
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:34,279
you out a file with an image

933
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,280
[Music]

934
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:49,660
stagger stagger image so I want the

935
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:52,660
image the that will help me exfiltrate

936
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:56,230
information or to communicate with my

937
00:53:52,660 --> 00:54:02,830
attacker so we have to start doing that

938
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:07,030
can I detect a PDF file with that steger

939
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:10,980
image so i really have to find out

940
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:14,320
whether the response machine equipment

941
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,970
realizes what is happening or not so and

942
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,030
then we start to make more and more

943
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:22,959
noise and to move more and more and then

944
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:26,320
we see to what extent we are detected or

945
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,590
not if any and this is a great exercise

946
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:32,350
if we take that as basis then we have to

947
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:34,960
say how can we stop that of course not

948
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:37,509
with an ideas ideas is not good at all

949
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,760
and this is the point this is a point

950
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:47,620
that I want to make you have to attack a

951
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:50,260
point what it hurts the most we have to

952
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:54,310
start working and collaborating as a

953
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:58,060
community and what it is essential is

954
00:54:54,310 --> 00:55:00,520
that you handle your own information so

955
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:03,670
that you don't give your information to

956
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:05,470
an external product to do it for you of

957
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:09,220
course we are not going to be able to

958
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:11,200
replace all the signatures of ideas but

959
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,720
let us have our own device that will

960
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,629
allow us to gather information to

961
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:20,230
analyze it if we can create our own

962
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:22,900
tools security factors should go through

963
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:26,530
the human aspects we really need to have

964
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:29,200
people people ready unable to detect

965
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:32,230
attacks and this is basically the end of

966
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:34,680
my presentation and well if you have any

967
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:38,640
questions I will be happy to take them

968
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,640
well I've gone over time I think

969
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:46,000
I think I've gone over time rights if

970
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:47,950
there are no questions thank you very

971
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,540
much for your attention that will be

972
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:51,430
around if you have any questions or

973
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,650
comments please do not hesitate to

974
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:59,908
approach me

975
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:59,909
[Applause]
