1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:10,670
good morning everyone thank you for

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,530
getting up early someone told me that

3
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:17,730
going out in late on a Friday night

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,000
could be a bit dangerous so thank you

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,320
very much for your kind introduction I

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,140
cannot see anything on the screen I

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,140
don't know what it is my fault or not

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:41,720
so first of all I'd like to find out

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,030
from you if you are aware of dualistic

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,060
so only two people so would you please

11
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,270
dim the lights a bit because I feel like

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:55,230
if I was being questioned I cannot see

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:01:02,850
the audience okay so thank you now okay

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:10,140
so do you know why ipv4 is or not do you

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:12,750
know what I PV IP version 6 is do you

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,200
know if you have any machines on the

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,860
internet with an ipv6 machine oh sorry a

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,140
machine with an ipv6 address have you

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:27,570
ever taking a look at whether you're

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,670
happy v is 6sf active or not alright so

21
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,820
today we will be talking about Julie

22
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:37,920
stack and possible problems that may

23
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,539
come from having an ipv6 in all the

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,510
machines that are connected to the

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:48,270
Internet so my name is Patti Scialfa

26
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:56,400
shoes gomez Rodriguez everyone calls me

27
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:58,080
from and the takeaway message for my

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,350
presentation is that you have a better

29
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,600
understanding of ipv6 and also that you

30
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,720
are aware of the problems that you may

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,549
have in you Camille machines those

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,420
machines that have dual stack are more

33
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:15,330
specifically an active dual stack so I

34
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,579
think hopefully I will cover all these

35
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,720
contents in my presentation that will be

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,269
lasting for an hour so let us start this

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,239
is the address that we always have had

38
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,489
in our computers and I'm sure that you

39
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,220
have seen it you have set it up and

40
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,709
probably you have kept it in your memory

41
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,830
so the open space for an ipv6 is quite

42
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,510
limited as it has happens in the history

43
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,530
of the internet when when someone

44
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:47,899
decided about that we said well broadly

45
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,900
these will last for a long time

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,899
but dad has started to be a problem

47
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,870
started to be a problem some time ago so

48
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:03,750
nowadays we cannot access and not be v6

49
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:06,360
by asking the provider to if you do

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,819
provider doesn't let you do it doesn't

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,510
give you access to it and I think they

52
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,910
said okay if the IP address that we

53
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,160
don't have now because we because we are

54
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:21,510
working the power of tune let us use a

55
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,180
number of ips that in principle you

56
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:30,090
should take a long time before we need

57
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:32,459
more IPS therefore we have the number of

58
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,400
5p v 6 addresses that are available

59
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,200
according to the protocol I don't know

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,870
whether there are any mathematicians in

61
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,569
this room and if so I would appreciate

62
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,420
if the they could sell me that number

63
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:49,040
but anyway I tells you that it dad is a

64
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,040
big big number

65
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:11,709
have you ever done an EVE config

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:13,870
everyone has done that you didn't well I

67
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:17,350
would invite you to come over here to do

68
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,090
it because it is a great experience all

69
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:23,050
right now will call you to the stage

70
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:24,340
later on so this is an eve conch I don't

71
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,020
know what that you've seen it or not

72
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,388
this is a machine that i have connected

73
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,240
to the internet and there are two I

74
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:34,450
piece it has a dual stack it has the

75
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,139
protocol ipv4 and six you can reach you

76
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:41,770
can consume the services of that sever

77
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,990
by using any of the two protocols so

78
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,200
here you see the difference between the

79
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:50,650
representation of an ipv6 and the four

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:54,190
wonderful ones are four octaves and then

81
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:58,570
the v6 they are eight in X of X amount

82
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,840
so in the previous slide we see why they

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:03,789
use the Excel decimal and if the word to

84
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,890
represent that in exile decimal the

85
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,440
numbers will be to be can apparently it

86
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:11,650
seems to be a simpler representation

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,310
because it makes the makes it shorter so

88
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,620
here you can see that the real address

89
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,200
interval halving ipv4 we have one IP

90
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,330
budding ipv6 there is a range do you

91
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,940
know how to represent branches in a PVC

92
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:28,330
for well in say messing up ev6 with a

93
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,340
slash sewing ipv6 there are so many so

94
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,710
many IPS that when they are signing

95
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:36,340
allocating an IP they are assigning you

96
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:39,849
a range so dodge 64 is large consisting

97
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,770
of 64 has exactly the same number of

98
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,900
high piece and they are for you the

99
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,139
problem is that you have to manage your

100
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:51,789
IP is more devices more IPS more

101
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:57,120
responsibility so therefore this is a

102
00:05:51,789 --> 00:06:02,469
tool a tool which is good fun because in

103
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:05,800
ipv6 calc it helps you get familiar with

104
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,440
it the idea is to minimize the number of

105
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,409
characters that you have to type in and

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,519
these

107
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:18,029
tool helps you compress the IP so we see

108
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:20,129
it compressed we see the full IP and it

109
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:23,639
is good for you to know the IPS judge

110
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:26,669
you are logging on to so so far so good

111
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,369
can you follow me well could you write

112
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:34,739
do you know how to write an ipv6 could

113
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:39,869
you'd remember one Travie not as you

114
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:42,149
know I don't know whether you have you

115
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:45,269
know whether home have an ipv6 or not

116
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:47,939
they only feel here in his pain well

117
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:49,589
some tests have it done in a spring in

118
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,469
2016 I've been lucky enough to

119
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:55,529
participate in those tests and I has a

120
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:58,199
choice the luck to have an ipv6 at home

121
00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:01,829
next year that will become a reality and

122
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,209
we will have ipv6 at home in the

123
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:06,389
meantime if you want to do something

124
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:10,259
with it we can use tunnel broker channel

125
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:13,289
broker takes your I beautiful traffic to

126
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:16,860
a point and then from that point onward

127
00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:19,619
your traffic becomes ipv6 it is a tube

128
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:22,289
tunnel it is a tunnel okay you start off

129
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:25,349
from ipv4 and then at the exit you are

130
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:27,929
ipv6 the limitation is that you can use

131
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,938
it for a test for testing but you cannot

132
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:32,279
really end up working with them because

133
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:34,379
they are often free of charge and well

134
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,050
it is good to play around with it too

135
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:41,699
and it helps you understand how a PVC

136
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:44,399
clear it's all about now it tells you

137
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:49,319
where we are in terms of deployment of

138
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:52,129
ipv6 so do you know can't you tell me

139
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:57,539
how much traffic on the Internet is

140
00:07:52,129 --> 00:08:03,419
running on ipv6 any idea would you say

141
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:08,938
ninety percent five percent trust a

142
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:11,929
sense that's the answer well the google

143
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:16,829
says that so perhaps this is not true

144
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:22,159
well this is the graph plotted and by

145
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:26,250
google and the idea is for it

146
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:32,550
to see this trend there is a trend it

147
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:37,830
seems that he wants to boom to boost

148
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:40,500
itself but not before the providers can

149
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:44,520
make it could profit out of it we will

150
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,670
have ipv6 everywhere I very much like

151
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,650
this map I don't know whether you have

152
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:53,729
seen it before or not and here we can

153
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:58,350
clearly see where there is a higher

154
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:01,140
prevalence of ipv6 there is an adoption

155
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,710
rate on the US of sixteen percent in

156
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,900
Spain we are at point one percent to be

157
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:10,200
honest I just don't believe that I

158
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:13,050
believe that those data are made based

159
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,290
on the TLD of the website that we are

160
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,569
using bab Frogley I Peavy or the

161
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:24,020
hospital reducing is the one is one

162
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:27,600
located in Germany and there is one

163
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:34,620
country which I especially like which is

164
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:39,750
Zimbabwe Zimbabwe has fifty percent 50

165
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:42,810
times more ipv6 than Spain and these in

166
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:46,470
the past was very appealing to me and I

167
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:49,619
said why in Zimbabwe there is more ipv6

168
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,950
traffic than in Spain very easy answer

169
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:56,520
because ipv6 claim later on and they

170
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:59,250
cannot buy ipv4 in Zimbabwe they just

171
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:05,310
buy the small amount of happy before

172
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:10,790
then because there are no no ipv4 left

173
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:10,790
and then they have to go and buy ipv6

174
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:24,079
any questions and it out sofa now

175
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:24,079
questions okay we move on

176
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:57,740
alright so we'll continue because i will

177
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,170
be showing you some demos we got in

178
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,560
depth option of ipv6 there is lots of

179
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:06,020
controversy there so if you go to a

180
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,319
conference in Europe the people from

181
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,880
swisscom which is a small provider say

182
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,220
it tells you that next year they

183
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,340
forecasted that they will have that the

184
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,200
percent of the traffic in ipv6 and in

185
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,420
2025 and sixty percent one hundred

186
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,900
percent of the traffic would be ipv6 I

187
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:27,530
believe that did is smokin it is not as

188
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:31,790
easy as that you may first your users to

189
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:33,470
use a BB app ev6 but you will need to

190
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,120
help them out when i told you that next

191
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,520
year we will have the chance to have a

192
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,250
greedy six at home I can't tell you

193
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,460
about my experience a day I had it on in

194
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,770
my home they connected me to the mobile

195
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,410
phone and I could see that the world he

196
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:51,560
had an ipv6 address can you tell me the

197
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:56,630
difference between ipv6 and four in the

198
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:01,400
range 194 I'm sure someone has the

199
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:05,840
answer well on ipv6 all the IP VIPs I

200
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,720
can be routed so all the IPS can be

201
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,000
reached from the internet so therefore

202
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,020
what is the problem the problem is that

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,140
when ipv6 is active at home anything

204
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:23,449
that you connect to your version by

205
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:25,640
default would be eligible to be routed

206
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,800
so that is to say if you don't take the

207
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,260
necessary measures or someone that's it

208
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,599
for you at a given point in time you

209
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:36,490
someone will reach your device a device

210
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:39,760
which is has been thought to be somehow

211
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,760
protected okay

212
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,269
I promise that I was here nine o'clock

213
00:12:52,300 --> 00:13:00,269
yeah and I did some testing and it went

214
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:03,510
well oh I have all my demos there

215
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,510
hopefully it works

216
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:33,350
so this is the graph that I told you

217
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,800
before by swisscom and this is the

218
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:40,190
forecast their forecasts and there is

219
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,890
another program for ipv6 well before I

220
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:45,980
PVC we will be having the dual stack and

221
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:47,750
realistic is costly for companies that

222
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,560
provide a service on the internet

223
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:56,030
because you need to set up all machines

224
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:59,900
so that they support both nuts and ipv6

225
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:02,510
I always compare ipv4 we fossil fuels

226
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,030
ever since I was a small and I went to

227
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,490
school someone at the time was already

228
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,839
saying oil will be over class will be

229
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:14,360
over we'll have to do something we will

230
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:17,000
run out of oil and gas and then this

231
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,830
year well this week the OPEC has said

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,990
that they will not be instructing so

233
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,270
much oil because there is a surplus of

234
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:27,020
oil in the world so the first time that

235
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:30,530
I connected to the ipv6 I thought that I

236
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,530
was well I it was the first time the

237
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:36,350
first time I started I got a job they

238
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:39,620
started to talk about ip6 because I said

239
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,360
that I pee before was about to be

240
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,560
finished I don't know who is behind

241
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,470
different hubs in Mason so Illuminati I

242
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,439
just know well but in the meantime okay

243
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,540
in the meantime I've until I pee before

244
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,960
is finished okay we'll have the dual

245
00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:00,620
stack dual stack means that from now on

246
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,920
many systems will have to I piece which

247
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,920
you will have to manage two different

248
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,209
ip's if you are not ready for ipv6

249
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,530
everything that you do on wrap it before

250
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:15,530
perhaps it is not useful at all because

251
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:18,680
you will have a way to access to your

252
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:21,860
system through ipv6 and now how many

253
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:27,709
ipv6 are available on the internet now

254
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:31,400
well Akamai will be providing ipv6 24

255
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:35,810
million devices on the network and these

256
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:37,430
are the steps that will make her ipv6 to

257
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:42,439
gain momentum and to

258
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:46,189
deployed on the internet there are very

259
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,870
many graphs or even Facebook runs

260
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:54,380
comparisons between how fast facebook

261
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:56,770
Michael on ipv6 vessels ipv4 well

262
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,320
Facebook is interested on that because

263
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:03,470
many years ago Facebook migrated all

264
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:07,120
systems to ipv6 they just want to stop

265
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:12,380
paying the hardware providers so that we

266
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:14,600
users can log onto the to Facebook in

267
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:19,209
countries where there are only ipv4

268
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:22,580
right now because we are in Lyon I

269
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:26,810
decided to bring this photograph with me

270
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:30,589
this is like beef jerk look typical from

271
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:33,649
here you know anyone from nail here well

272
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:37,899
imagine that you have a company of beef

273
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:41,900
jerk and everyone likes beef York and

274
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:45,980
then imagine that you have your business

275
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:48,770
is going very well you open up a website

276
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,600
you by hosting and then to make your

277
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:57,650
service is known and then there comes a

278
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:59,990
time one day and one day the another

279
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,689
person comes to you and says okay i want

280
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:07,609
to buy beef jerk and then they come here

281
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:09,160
to buy it and then you realize that your

282
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,540
markets on the Internet can be

283
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,839
significant and then you decide to set

284
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:16,760
up a website and then you have a small

285
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,948
market place but you can sell your

286
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,319
products over the Internet everything

287
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,600
goes well and in recent day that you

288
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:28,790
have very many orders and you need to

289
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:31,820
manage your stocks you also higher sales

290
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:36,440
person a person who is around promoting

291
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:38,570
your product etc and then there comes a

292
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,000
time that you decide to make an

293
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:46,100
investment on technology and then divide

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,200
a machine internet for your company do

295
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,320
you also have a company you have also

296
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,779
store a physical store and then as

297
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,210
well as an online mr. and then you set

298
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:59,940
up everything and then you set up the

299
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:04,659
Apache server who has started an Apache

300
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:08,230
server in the machines at least once ok

301
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:11,230
all of you do you know that the server

302
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:14,919
is status automatically in ipv6 as long

303
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:18,370
as ipv6 is available when you start the

304
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,980
Apache server automatically if ipv6

305
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,320
available it is a sad affair and you may

306
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,830
wonder why why does that happened

307
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:30,009
because ipv6 is not a reality jet a long

308
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,110
term or sometime long time ago

309
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:36,279
everything has been thought to run on

310
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:39,340
ipv6 the problem is us that we do not do

311
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:43,750
it like that when you call and dns then

312
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:45,428
it gives you a register on ipv6 and if

313
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,220
you don't understand it it gives it to

314
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:50,740
unite p before but by default it gives

315
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:54,370
you ipv6 and the same cultural services

316
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:57,370
by default they are started on ipv6 and

317
00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:00,549
what will happen if i scan these machine

318
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:05,258
i will do a demo now to see what happens

319
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:08,529
in it port 80 if i do that how will see

320
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:11,440
it on both ipv4 and ipv6 and then you

321
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:14,759
will go and say well no problem well the

322
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:19,899
person working in that store here

323
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:23,019
selling the food is not a problem within

324
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:25,418
just two Darfur fiend will do the IP

325
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:28,710
tablet and then here that command says

326
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:31,450
do not let anyone to reach the port 80

327
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,700
imagine that you are very extreme do

328
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:37,629
don't want anyone to go there but that

329
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:41,980
means that we are going to our website

330
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:44,168
and we are filtering only in happy

331
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,470
before because I p tablet on the work

332
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:49,960
song ipv4 so therefore our system our

333
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,740
internet system would be available on

334
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:56,590
ipv6 we will need to use ipv6 table to

335
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,320
close to close the ipv6 and then you may

336
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:04,029
go and say well that only happens to

337
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:06,428
small stores selling beef jerky

338
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:08,830
he Leon well actually I don't know

339
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:11,349
whether you can sell and beef your

340
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:14,080
condoms and or not I hope so i think so

341
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:16,889
alright so now are you aware of Mensa

342
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,889
you know Mensa

343
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:42,158
alright so Disease Association of people

344
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:49,299
with high IQ son let me show you

345
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:52,990
something for you to know all right so

346
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:56,379
if you want to take the preliminary test

347
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,850
okay they charge you 10 euros to pay 10

348
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:01,659
euros for someone to tell you that you

349
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:07,750
are stupid well that's interesting okay

350
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:09,340
joking apart well this is what I got

351
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:16,809
what I found that we could having any

352
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:18,970
other website so all right I think

353
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:21,549
perhaps they should know more about ipv6

354
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:27,279
okay anyway they have a service it is

355
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:31,570
known as Philemon dot men sad eyes what

356
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:33,669
does that mean it means that they have

357
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,750
the internet service this is an

358
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:39,340
association and they are providing

359
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,080
services hands i guess that those

360
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,480
services have to be available to

361
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:49,059
everyone imagine that i asked that IP

362
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,850
for whatever reason i know that this is

363
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:55,570
a dns draw that provides a service to

364
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:58,779
Mensa and then I go and ask it okay tell

365
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,730
me everything that you know about Mensa

366
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:05,610
do you know what is a zone transfer of

367
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:09,490
DNS could anyone explain it to me okay

368
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:11,889
does you worry okay some transfer it

369
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,830
means asking a DNS ever do you know what

370
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:18,580
a dns server is a dns server makes it

371
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:22,510
possible to browse the web and then you

372
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:26,879
may ask the dns server to tell you

373
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:29,649
everything it knows about the area it

374
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,659
controls the mens are seven knows about

375
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,489
all the names of the machines that mensa

376
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:35,409
is using in the servers and then you can

377
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,809
ask it to tell you everything about that

378
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:40,350
four or five years ago it was very

379
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:43,870
difficult to do a post setting of the

380
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:46,809
mensa and sever therefore

381
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:49,870
can really easy to dump all the IPS and

382
00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:52,180
internal domains and you cannot do that

383
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,429
anymore it doesn't let you do that

384
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,680
anymore they tell you that that is no

385
00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:00,309
longer available and what happens if I

386
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:03,400
ask me ipv6 to do that for me it doesn't

387
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:06,190
give me that info it doesn't give me

388
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,580
that data because that server which is

389
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:12,160
older than as on the internet is one of

390
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,800
the pillars of the Internet therefore

391
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,220
therefore you will use all the available

392
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:21,428
RCC's when it says that ipv6 have to be

393
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:39,309
activated enabled so therefore this

394
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:43,059
comment here if I hold Mensa and we ask

395
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:47,700
filament men Sadat yes and then we say

396
00:23:43,059 --> 00:24:03,730
hi X of our which is the command for the

397
00:23:47,700 --> 00:24:10,620
sound reference ok here it is but is it

398
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:13,300
is returning all the open all the logs

399
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:17,620
all the register that I be induced on

400
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:19,510
the D&S so I said that they liked comic

401
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:23,919
strips because the one of the Nemesis

402
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:26,290
mortadella and philemon well these are

403
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,910
the things that happening so probably

404
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,980
they did not start the fire world

405
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:35,740
probably you may don't know that these

406
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:36,970
that is running on ipv6 Oh probably you

407
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,710
don't even know that the service has

408
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:43,950
been started or that it is badly set up

409
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:48,520
so well it seems that someone knows that

410
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:50,800
it knows about the back and settings so

411
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,550
it means that someone has been touching

412
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:57,659
the settings but not all the right

413
00:24:54,550 --> 00:25:01,690
settings to fix it and because these

414
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:04,090
facilitation is about back doors and I

415
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,460
said ok let us now we want to find any

416
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:12,810
domain names with the name parking on it

417
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:12,810
and this is the 24 hour parking calm and

418
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,710
exactly the same thing happens with this

419
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,950
service but this Sammy seems as it issue

420
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:25,179
is firewall Apes you I just did an nmap

421
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:29,530
you know what an nmap is well only few

422
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:37,530
of you mmm i was expecting more hands up

423
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:37,530
if i do an em up on this domain name

424
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:53,290
and then I say port 587 and then I do

425
00:25:46,780 --> 00:26:02,799
and map on the very same domain but on

426
00:25:53,290 --> 00:26:05,409
ipv6 and simple hold on can you see that

427
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:10,379
I'm writing down the domain well the

428
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:14,290
action tool takes care of the resolution

429
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:21,690
so what we are seeing here is that the

430
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:26,530
port on ipv4 is centered someone has

431
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:31,360
started the fire wall so that no one can

432
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:34,330
access this service but I didn't do that

433
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,459
on ipv6 and here we have one more

434
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:41,080
variable which is the dual stack many

435
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:44,650
perimeter protection systems do not

436
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,899
support ipv6 so therefore you should

437
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,360
filter it from the origin you cannot

438
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:54,190
really do a bad setting and trust your

439
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:57,189
perimeter security measure ok and this

440
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:02,020
is what is happening here someone has

441
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:04,990
not set up the firewall well and let us

442
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:08,260
go beyond that imagine that we hold that

443
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:12,790
service we ask about that service do you

444
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:14,799
know what happens on your own port 63 79

445
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:18,840
do you know what ready sees you know

446
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,879
what a tale is only two of us that it

447
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:26,459
computer science all three well I time

448
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:29,770
is a tale but in computer engineering

449
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,510
okay you just set up something or you

450
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:35,830
leave something there for someone else

451
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:37,960
to use it for that is a server user and

452
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:40,600
then when we said in the past i said oh

453
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,540
i left the poor opens and then well you

454
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,449
may have a son vulnerability and some

455
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:50,139
someone may break into your system but

456
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:53,530
sometimes if you leave a door open of a

457
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,610
port that displays information that

458
00:27:53,530 --> 00:28:01,220
expresses information well you may

459
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:04,570
have a problem there I don't know

460
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:11,480
whether you're aware of this tool aunt

461
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:15,678
Ella all until a tower only one of you

462
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:20,990
is aware of it well this is a tool

463
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:25,549
developed by a friend of mine and the

464
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:28,130
sukkah next to readies and ask for all

465
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:29,870
the available information at the point

466
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:38,150
since i'm all available information at

467
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:40,010
the tail well i'm glad that i have a

468
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,070
screenshot with me so that you can see

469
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,070
it

470
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:15,919
but you are seeing now is a life dump of

471
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,720
that tail often these type of readies

472
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,560
the problem is that some people are

473
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,840
using it to paste the cookies messages

474
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,960
among services that are managing users

475
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,260
so therefore the problem is that that

476
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,360
person has that system enabled on ipv6

477
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,980
but is not aware of it because it has

478
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,709
installed something by default it has

479
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:39,830
not set it up and probably stressing the

480
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:44,390
available firewall on the machine that

481
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:49,100
is using therefore and here we have all

482
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:51,920
these data and you could stop that if

483
00:29:49,100 --> 00:30:04,610
you were to implement the same security

484
00:29:51,920 --> 00:30:07,220
measure on both stacks and you think

485
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:09,800
that this is happening to people who are

486
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,720
setting up internet services and they

487
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,290
are learning from YouTube don't you

488
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:18,170
think that this doesn't happen to

489
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:20,540
everyone I'm not going to say out the

490
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:25,010
name of the company but it is a big

491
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:28,250
company there are many services that

492
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:31,100
many years ago where all the time being

493
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:33,320
discussed the insecurities conferences

494
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,320
because people used to leave them open

495
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,260
so one of them was telnet helen had a

496
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,300
huge repercussions especially for

497
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,750
internet providers because at the end of

498
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:47,680
the day big old bruisers those managing

499
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:52,960
lots of traffic were being managed on

500
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:57,260
well-managed chantal net and now we are

501
00:30:52,960 --> 00:31:02,500
logging 27 has the tender closed and

502
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,500
open on ipv6 that's the banner

503
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:11,890
what is showing us his exposing a cisco

504
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:15,350
routed to the internet through port 23

505
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:19,789
which is kind of going back to nineteen

506
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:23,510
eighty nine I don't know whether

507
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:25,879
somebody here in 1989 locked down to the

508
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:28,190
Internet connected to the Internet well

509
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,169
that Rueter has that framework will have

510
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,789
to be very very careful because the

511
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:34,280
assistance even if they are all they

512
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:36,320
will be they will start themselves in

513
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,299
ipv6 because for a long time they've

514
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,490
been implementing ipv6 even if the

515
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:43,150
operating system is not available that

516
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:46,429
does not depend on them they just use it

517
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:53,780
and now this is a lack see sample mongo

518
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:57,559
DB after all the new internet service

519
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:59,418
run on ipv6 so these we are talking

520
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:01,639
about relatively new technologies

521
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:03,470
starting on ipv6 and what happens here

522
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:09,289
you have to be careful for instance in

523
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:11,780
this case this Mongol it has exactly the

524
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:15,350
same situation it has filtered the sea

525
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:22,309
to port on ipv4 but hasn't filter it on

526
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:25,189
ipv6 what does that mean it means that

527
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:27,740
the database the monk / database is

528
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:31,210
being exposed I don't know well do you

529
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:34,700
know what MongoDB is have you ever

530
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:39,080
connected to a MongoDB even if you don't

531
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:41,539
have credentials you can ask things it

532
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,260
is not as intuitive as telnet but you

533
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:49,640
can log onto it if you connect there if

534
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:51,289
you connect to it this script will

535
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,780
connect to Mongo will ask for

536
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:56,570
information of the service first we'll

537
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,820
do that online pv6 and then on ipv6 here

538
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:02,510
this is what it returns some ipv6 and

539
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:06,530
then he lives has all the information of

540
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:09,740
MongoDB which is running on that ipv you

541
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:11,149
understand the planning of that okay

542
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,380
good

543
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:17,850
do you understand that these two don't

544
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,620
do at home what are we are not doing

545
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:23,399
anything i'm just asking i don't know

546
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,779
whether it is my mashing or not but it

547
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:27,809
would happen so I don't make any

548
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:30,299
mistakes when logging on to it so this

549
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:31,980
is nice this is a client right this one

550
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,870
is in Germany naturally because if it's

551
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,500
your a bits Germany that the way it is

552
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:39,658
and what we have here is a static IP

553
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:42,090
someone is buying an static IP for a

554
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,129
server they are setting up in their own

555
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:47,459
machines probably for their own company

556
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:50,158
and still don't know that it's running

557
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:53,100
on ipv6 because it's left centered or

558
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,330
focused on ipv4 if it were closed it

559
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,459
would be different problem but when

560
00:33:54,330 --> 00:34:00,418
filtered it means that they don't know

561
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:02,009
that it is on ipv6 problem is that if

562
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:04,590
you have an ideas you don't even see it

563
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:06,899
and probably when you go for a forensic

564
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,369
analyze you say who stole it all from me

565
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,989
and you don't even realize that they've

566
00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:11,520
been using a different protocol and you

567
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:22,229
don't know how your information is

568
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:27,050
Benedict's filter good so let's move on

569
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:27,050
to our next level

570
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:40,630
differences between scanning ipv4 or

571
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:44,620
ipv6 any one time it is time so if you

572
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:47,380
remember we had a ipv4 range for all the

573
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:49,350
ipv4 and all the ipv6 that were

574
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:55,290
available if we go back to that slide

575
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:55,290
difference is quite impressive right so

576
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:04,390
you might have used some of these tools

577
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:07,810
for ipv4 Soudan census does it that dude

578
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:14,290
a ring a bell see them or anyone see the

579
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:18,070
map sorry anyone maybe players so these

580
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:21,550
tools are focusing on ipv4 I don't know

581
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:25,450
if you knew but see the map is a project

582
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:28,480
that has a large simply for anyone to

583
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:31,060
scan to sweep the whole port that can be

584
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,710
inverted in just 5 minutes and that's

585
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:37,540
what they say it depends on the version

586
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:39,070
you have and so now one day one week

587
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:43,000
that's what it takes you to scan the

588
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:45,940
whole ipv4 you can ask every machine on

589
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,580
the internet and see what ports are open

590
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,920
what services aren't running if we were

591
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:53,529
to do it on ipv6 that would not be

592
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:59,620
possible and that's the problem if we

593
00:35:53,530 --> 00:36:02,230
cannot find out ipv6 then that means we

594
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:05,410
are a bit more safer right if they

595
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:11,980
cannot find you they cannot touch you so

596
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:15,029
that leave that even CEOs as security

597
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:18,100
companies have its burgers because

598
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,750
sooner or later your IP will be exposed

599
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,700
on the internet for someone to see

600
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:24,070
because it is is the final purpose of an

601
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,759
IP have someone connected to your

602
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:30,010
machine whether it's you or not problem

603
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,850
here well right now it's so so very

604
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:36,760
difficult to find ipv6 addresses or a

605
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:38,350
scan the whole ipv6 range so for someone

606
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,570
to say let's connect to the IPS that

607
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:43,270
have been deployed in Zimbabwe

608
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:46,590
by whatever operator that's quite quite

609
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:49,330
complicated as a matter of fact on ipv6

610
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:51,310
the scanning tools do not support a

611
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:53,920
range not even a small range because the

612
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:57,220
smallest range in ipv6 with this gas

613
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,890
debt is ipv4 so it's a very complicated

614
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,709
right now to have a simple

615
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:06,279
implementation to scan ipv6 ranges

616
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:09,640
actually many people complain that tools

617
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:13,510
machines for pen testing you need to

618
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:16,990
type the addresses yourself because

619
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:21,160
there's no been an easy finding again

620
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:22,750
this our IP addresses on the internet

621
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,339
for local networks there are the

622
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:30,490
mechanisms we have the neighbor finding

623
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:36,010
tool that is similar to to that and for

624
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:41,259
ipv4 and just to close it up let me

625
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:44,230
refer to mr. Luca look Wow so he looks

626
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,700
like the spanish dr. Santiago Segura you

627
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:50,110
know this is the face that comes to mind

628
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:52,450
when you think of him and mr. Luca well

629
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:54,220
it is a project that I've created with a

630
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:57,279
colleague that should have been here but

631
00:37:54,220 --> 00:38:00,220
it couldn't make it and we are trying to

632
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,930
have that ipv6 map that is not existent

633
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:06,910
now for some time now that we've been

634
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:09,730
tired of watching Google stats and other

635
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:12,580
entities that start saying ipv6 that

636
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:15,300
it's available what's not and we said it

637
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:18,910
is pointless let's ask an all ip's and

638
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:23,140
see what the reality of ipv6 deployment

639
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:25,810
is mr. lucre it is very user-friendly

640
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:30,009
Soudan style we will compare results

641
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:36,340
with Soudan in a minute well only thing

642
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:39,170
you need to do is lock in it is free of

643
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:42,410
charge here it is

644
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:44,720
and if you can certify your researcher

645
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:47,509
and send an email saying that what

646
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,209
you're going to do is just for

647
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:53,510
themselves and there is no

648
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:56,569
responsibility yeah we have no

649
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:58,190
responsibility and will not be held

650
00:38:56,569 --> 00:39:01,279
accountable for what they do they will

651
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:04,280
have more privileges the idea is to

652
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,079
conduct a few operations from here is

653
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,859
where I got the examples that I've shown

654
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:19,540
you here they are so this is talent

655
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:19,540
surface what is the main this is Mongo

656
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:26,089
so maybe and you come up with a search

657
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:30,950
you are you interested in anything you

658
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:37,609
would like to know anything that's

659
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:41,930
something such as all dot as domains

660
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:44,029
rain so digital series of sides with

661
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:47,990
services running on domains that are

662
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:50,780
dark ass does not mean that IPS are

663
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:54,500
located in Spain it means the domain

664
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:56,390
associated to it it's a dot SS men that

665
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,740
it's latching the Spain and I say it out

666
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:01,430
of experience because most of these

667
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:04,660
sites are locked or hosted it in island

668
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:10,970
or Germany where the ipv6 services are

669
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:13,308
widespread but you may say well someone

670
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:16,220
needs to have sites here in Spain yes

671
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:21,170
there are few services that are here in

672
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:23,990
Spain it you all see them into leather

673
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:26,480
because a geolocation it's our book for

674
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:32,750
ipv6 and so it's not as accurate as a

675
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:35,030
when compared to ipv4 we can have

676
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:39,020
searches that can be as complex as we

677
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:43,609
want them to be but we are trying to map

678
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:46,220
the whole ipv6 network in the most

679
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:48,740
practical way possible because we do not

680
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,839
have the resources to map it all and

681
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,069
even if we had the route it would take a

682
00:40:50,839 --> 00:41:00,699
silver lung

683
00:40:52,069 --> 00:41:00,699
still it is very interesting to see how

684
00:41:00,729 --> 00:41:10,759
internet services are evolving and we

685
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:12,469
will post it on our blog and how there

686
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:15,319
were many services that were available

687
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:17,119
and LEDs year and now they are filtered

688
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:20,269
so there are people who are working now

689
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,930
hot and they are focusing on making sure

690
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:26,269
that ipv6 is secularized no no search

691
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:33,198
that you're interested in no enemies

692
00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:34,968
you've got very complicated we're just

693
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:47,479
using it okay tweet it to me or

694
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:57,819
something right so spell it good at Bell

695
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:57,819
dot do B dot V in this won't be there

696
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:06,198
this is a Venezuelan telecommunication

697
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:10,940
regulating system maybe this was not

698
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:14,660
been scanned well let's hope the jump

699
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:19,219
banners from the country there you have

700
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:24,920
it we risk and we would like I hope

701
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:28,130
nothing comes to us so yes services are

702
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,599
active and they know services are active

703
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,839
because they've been said I understand

704
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,959
so you can run different tests

705
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:40,479
everything that it's done on mr. Locher

706
00:42:35,959 --> 00:42:44,749
is not intrusive it's just are sold in

707
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:48,198
so this is a link we're we can compare

708
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:50,299
it to Soudan to see if it has ipv4 and

709
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:53,029
what's the difference between both here

710
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:56,690
soudan has not scanned it I don't know

711
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:58,959
if it's out of fear we can try it if you

712
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,959
wish

713
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:28,520
it is open both services are open are

714
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:34,118
there any questions examples any ports

715
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:34,119
that you're interested in your friend

716
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:51,230
from back there i don't think i will

717
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:53,180
hear you question is how long has IP

718
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:55,670
visits being implemented for how long I

719
00:43:53,180 --> 00:44:01,569
don't know how old your but maybe you

720
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:03,500
weren't born nothing so very long

721
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:07,040
actually let me go back to my

722
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:09,920
presentation because this is a link for

723
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,290
our FC I don't know if you know what it

724
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,020
is that's where the Internet Protocol

725
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:22,670
definitions are written think there was

726
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:25,130
one here this one here RCC this will

727
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:28,010
discusses where the broker tunnel this

728
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:30,710
is from 2001 and this is a ton of broken

729
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:40,960
there might be a ipv6 stuff written

730
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:40,960
before 2000 good thank you anyone else

731
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:52,480
and then just to finish I have any

732
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:54,760
version so go for questions now that you

733
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,510
say domains but what's safer dot s or

734
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:02,740
com what's more secure I have no clue

735
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:06,340
about computers with a dot-com domain

736
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:10,149
you will pay less that's all but what

737
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:12,100
about email i have two hotmail accounts

738
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:14,740
that comment that s but does matter

739
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:17,230
domain it's a series of characters

740
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:22,419
written into a dns so that when you ask

741
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:25,570
you get an IP response it is an ID don't

742
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:29,560
ask calm it's kind of to build up

743
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:32,290
sectors in on the internet that is is a

744
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,029
spain harm is world level but do not

745
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,520
think that a domain would be safer than

746
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:38,530
than the other the only thing the bunch

747
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:41,440
of security would be the protocol you

748
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:51,850
use since you get connected to log on

749
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:56,200
domain is just the means to get there so

750
00:45:51,850 --> 00:46:00,670
very interesting what kind of protocols

751
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:03,669
do you implement to look for IPS

752
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:08,260
protocol means given algorithm right I

753
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:15,400
cannot tell you sorry not been published

754
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:18,000
yet so what I can say is a super

755
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,790
distributed system is fully distributed

756
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,950
same us with sidim set map that just all

757
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,779
on your machine and you can do it from

758
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:28,230
home this one is much more complicated

759
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:33,220
and let me tell you why because not

760
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:35,110
every thing's been rooted on ipv6 it's

761
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:38,100
not just humming ipv6 but everything has

762
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:40,680
to be rigid are not all routes have been

763
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:43,630
tracked the way we would like them to

764
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,009
but we will release the weight we do it

765
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,670
because we are discussing it with

766
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:53,400
different people to see how to improve

767
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:53,400
it and how to build a community to

768
00:46:53,870 --> 00:47:00,500
reach out a large enough number of ips

769
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:02,090
IP addresses to understand that we have

770
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,230
a reasonable knowledge of what's out

771
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:09,590
there on the internet thank you very

772
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:12,140
much good morning I have a question for

773
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:16,430
this search and mr. Locke where I think

774
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:19,160
you said MDEs which is Ministry of

775
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:24,080
Defence Nana that's a mistake that's for

776
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:30,799
sure education that stands for education

777
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:37,460
not defense in close friends just

778
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:42,800
actually whoa we need to talk to them so

779
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:50,240
they are releasing the DNA sir a version

780
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:56,270
so no it's not no problem no problem is

781
00:47:50,240 --> 00:48:03,609
just 19 it could happen to anyone let me

782
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:05,620
show you so

783
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:17,310
you asked about something else Oh

784
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:21,370
non-extradition countries what nowadays

785
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:24,430
who does have active ipv6 that can be

786
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:26,440
writable as you say it's not the whole

787
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:31,930
internet that anyone can communicate

788
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:34,440
with anyone so ipv6 access in Spain

789
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:38,109
that's not much right here so who does

790
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:42,910
have add vegetable ipv6 that can be

791
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:44,950
routed from other neighbors AT&T and any

792
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:51,270
other large American companies have

793
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:55,930
already implemented it then well

794
00:48:51,270 --> 00:49:00,190
Deutsche Telekom as well so all large

795
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:03,460
operators on the internet operating in

796
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:06,010
North America and no the bureau they

797
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:08,140
work on ipv6 and it's been implemented

798
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:10,630
and they offer it to their users but

799
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:13,390
careful because many users ask for it

800
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:17,410
have you called your operator and ask do

801
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:19,960
you have ipv6 I advise you to do it so I

802
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:23,890
understand that even if Deutsche Telekom

803
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:26,140
has ipv6 and it's on the u.s. cannot

804
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:30,720
reach is not bridgit yes that one would

805
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:33,879
be rated what I mean is it might not be

806
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,549
routed if it comes from our server gone

807
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:44,710
from I from a survey on to Germany on

808
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:47,110
ipv6 that's what I meant so there might

809
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:49,060
not be so many people paying attention

810
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:53,610
making sure that all routes are always

811
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:57,340
up to date ipv6 is still changing and so

812
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:58,840
for ipv4 everyone is paying close

813
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:02,080
attention to the routes that are

814
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,670
available to connect one to the next the

815
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,100
minute something fails everyone realizes

816
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,570
but for ipv6 it takes longer for people

817
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,779
to realize it because they're not so

818
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:15,200
many people who are surfing or browsing

819
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:19,680
through native ipv6 thank you

820
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:24,930
so 37 seconds left there is a time of

821
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:28,169
air this is example for the new version

822
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:30,180
this is dual stack and our new version

823
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:33,570
is focusing on dual stop this is a graph

824
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:37,190
where you see ipv4 the one that we found

825
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:39,720
sorry the ipv6 we found with ipv4 and

826
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:42,060
they are linked through their domain

827
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:45,120
right and what you can see here is the

828
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:48,029
difference between ipv4 and ipv6 what we

829
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,580
said before this is at port 23 that you

830
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:53,640
cannot find on ipv4 so just at a glance

831
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:55,680
we see what you saw before with enema em

832
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:01,500
up and everything else here it is all

833
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:04,259
represented okay just blinking now so

834
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,940
let me thank you for being here and I

835
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:10,470

836
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:14,940
ipv6 and dual stock come to mr.

837
