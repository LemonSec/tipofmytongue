1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:09,690
hello nearly good afternoon now let us

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,269
talk about IOUs I'm sure that you'll

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,520
know what is which is the operating

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:20,550
system for Apple for mobile devices and

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,939
many people in the industry consider

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,609
that iOS is probably the most secure

7
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,529
mobile platform and this is what we will

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,949
be discussing in this presentation we

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,170
will look into whether it is as safe as

10
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,329
they say so that you can draw your own

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,520
conclusions which is our latest the

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:44,550
latest iOS version ok ten 10.14 ready

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,870
well it should say ten point zero point

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:53,129
one because when they launched 10 is 10

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,440
they had already 1001 and then we may

16
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,019
wonder why one hour later they released

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,329
a different a second fashion the thing

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,789
is that Apple forgot to patch of

19
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,890
vulnerability which was quite critical

20
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,229
it is one of the three Pegasus

21
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,470
vulnerabilities that allows you to have

22
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:13,010
full remote control of the device and

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,229
they have it has been used in the real

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:18,810
environment against the defender of

25
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:22,560
Human Rights that personal heart being

26
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,049
attacked and then it was a critical from

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,310
the avila team so my presentation will

28
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,799
be divided into sections a section that

29
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,509
focusing on malamar wherever I owe the

30
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,759
state of the art right now type of

31
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,460
techniques that are being used and also

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,189
well well my presentation will be a bit

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,470
technical so I will not dwell into lots

34
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,779
of detail so if you have specific

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,289
details later on approach me and ask

36
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,659
them to me and now we will be also be

37
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,610
looking at the number of nur abilities

38
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,899
which have very common locust tree in

39
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,990
digital certificate software updates

40
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:03,570
this may sound very normal however these

41
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,339
are not as perhaps as secure as they

42
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,949
should be let us start talking about

43
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,670
apples and which is the state of the art

44
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,670
and basically you are well aware of your

45
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,010
market share

46
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:18,429
the country at international level a

47
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,929
pool in South Mobile's event as between

48
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,840
fifteen and twenty percent of market

49
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,849
share depending on when the new device

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,280
is released and that's what explains the

51
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,799
ups and downs in that graph and then

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,730
android has a larger market share

53
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:39,790
because of has wider tight range here

54
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,738
for what we have been having iOS pretend

55
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,290
years now through seven and several

56
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:48,640
devices and now I want to share some

57
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:52,030
figures with you so that see what you if

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,500
you guess the actual figures so when I

59
00:02:52,030 --> 00:03:02,080
06 we had 200 vulnerabilities for iOS 7

60
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:05,140
we had 80 or 90 iOS 8 at that time we

61
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,810
had 272 all together here I'm talking

62
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,109
about official vulnerability some are

63
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,180
more critical others are less critical

64
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,959
how many vulnerabilities do you think is

65
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,900
nine hat who thinks that we had more or

66
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,690
less anyone would like to guess it to

67
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,690
kiss a figure who believes that we had

68
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:29,140
more vulnerability in now it's nine well

69
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,239
you're not hopeful people so everyone

70
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,920
was to say more more you are negative

71
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,359
yes you are right you are right 332

72
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,958
vulnerabilities in iOS 9 and what about

73
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:42,519
iOS 10 well same question who thinks who

74
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,810
thinks that number of vulnerabilities

75
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:53,829
was higher okay again well did negative

76
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:56,799
attitudes ok so is 10 miles 10 in watch

77
00:03:53,829 --> 00:04:01,239
OS which is the operating system for the

78
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:04,000
SmartWatch because he has very many

79
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:09,340
modules libraries kernels and with iOS

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,400
and Mac OS so that's e OS for desktop or

81
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,950
mobile well that's the number or now

82
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,079
number of and abilities when I Oh Stan

83
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,690
was released was seven and I said well

84
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,519
something is going wrong here this is

85
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,280
just impossible looking at the prior

86
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,010
statistics and then seeing what happens

87
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,789
they launched a new version in the past

88
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:33,190
some of them were 170 70 and said seven

89
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,860
no this cannot be true and yes I was

90
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:39,430
right one week later it was found that

91
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,620
it had 49 and why a week later a week

92
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,380
later because many of them were shared

93
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,200
with OS x t OS X was not in the market

94
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,419
yet so therefore Apple didn't want to

95
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,030
disclose the potential vulnerabilities

96
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:55,139
that could have an effect on Io X and

97
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:58,390
they just wanted to wait to wait for and

98
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,600
to have the available version with the

99
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:04,570
fixed vulnerabilities and well here we

100
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,970
can see that there is a problem in the

101
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:10,210
industry and less safe as more secure

102
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,940
code is developed we will continue to

103
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,890
have so very many vulnerabilities so

104
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,530
therefore that is a bit of help okay you

105
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,050
can continue to make it having a career

106
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,849
in security as well as your children as

107
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,760
well as you crunch children because

108
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,430
problems are not being resolved from the

109
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,680
root and now malware when we talk about

110
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,810
malware many people think about that yes

111
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,990
it is true there is lots of mobile

112
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,000
malware for Android but not only for

113
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,650
that and that's what it's important and

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,280
that's what I want to take a look at now

115
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:44,590
so curiosity now well some of the

116
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,630
sayings of reflections that I'd like you

117
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,469
to bear in mind in mind throughout the

118
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:53,110
presentation is the following if

119
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,690
something that's not exist if it has no

120
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,300
name it does not exist you know that

121
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,640
apple doesn't want is to have an

122
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,340
antivirus or similar security software

123
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,419
and Devon I bilities and malware seems

124
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:09,849
to be not classified so badly if it does

125
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:13,240
not exist it has no name so this is a

126
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:16,539
list of the last Manuel Simmons that we

127
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:21,669
saw last year as well as Deez yeah so

128
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:24,099
here we have all these long list and we

129
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,770
not dwell on that I will focus on two

130
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,669
critical aspects how do we distribute

131
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:33,640
apps well sometimes well out of the

132
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:36,099
official app store and then I will also

133
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:41,800
focus on how

134
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:45,620
api's are abused so that is to say to

135
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,750
gain more privileged access access to

136
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,240
the platform so when it comes to

137
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,940
distribution out of the App Store I'd

138
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,860
like you to stick to this Apple has a

139
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,670
number of development program for

140
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,960
individual developers another one

141
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:02,540
operating nature so that you can

142
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,359
distribute apps within you cooperation

143
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:08,180
and this program is very interesting

144
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,520
because apparently that program you can

145
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,210
distribute applications without going

146
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,130
through the App Store app store is where

147
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,320
Apple has greater control about these

148
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:23,000
type of apps that are distributed and

149
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:27,860
then we also discovered from research

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,130
that we did was that any user could

151
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:35,720
install apps as long as they are signed

152
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:37,760
by a corporate developer working or

153
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,100
involved in this second program that I

154
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,659
just mentioned so that means that two

155
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:49,190
tabs will help any user to install any

156
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:54,410
app that I'm developed through that

157
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:57,050
cooperate program so two tubs only how

158
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:59,630
does it work very simply developer

159
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,610
requires is corporate certificate three

160
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:06,760
hundred dollars per year I also need a

161
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:09,110
server with HTTPS because they need

162
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,210
there is a need to use an encrypted

163
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:15,290
server and then this generates the

164
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:18,469
malware up its proper it is given a

165
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:21,080
provisioning profile to distribute in

166
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,360
physical devices and that's it it is

167
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,240
uploaded in the web and then sends out

168
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,440
the link for people to download the app

169
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:34,880
from eyres so the link looks like this

170
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:38,809
like it says on the screen and here it

171
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:42,590
has to use HTTPS and then it points of a

172
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,900
plist file which is an XML and it has

173
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:48,770
this link and that's where we have the

174
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,319
IP a package of the iOS application that

175
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,530
we will

176
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,920
installing notice the look and feel of

177
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:58,650
it so these commands because I was given

178
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,780
a training on mobiles and then students

179
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,850
came out and said do you know that there

180
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:07,290
is an after it is being distributed out

181
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:11,790
of the APIs to this was legit and this

182
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:15,839
was to try out and up to see whether it

183
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:18,449
worked in China and in Spain and this is

184
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,290
a treat for someone says try out it up

185
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:25,470
it is an up to measure the bandwidth of

186
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:30,630
your connection so do tap needs and then

187
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:32,760
you see that link the itms and then it

188
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:36,300
says is asks me what I want to install

189
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:39,180
it and I say yes and then it says starts

190
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:44,069
to be installed out of the app store

191
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:46,500
that occurred from in iOS 8 and it is

192
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,870
started to reduced it was used to

193
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,540
distribute malware therefore apple took

194
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,400
a number of messages so you see here

195
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,949
when you stole the up there is a new

196
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,890
profile there's a new profile associated

197
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,650
to the developer that developed the app

198
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,380
and then the application is installed

199
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:08,670
and that's it so here we have the

200
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:11,250
profile and here we see the you only

201
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,719
need to click on the icon we see details

202
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,520
of the developer and and their

203
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,970
application works perfectly all right

204
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:20,250
and now on the right we can see exactly

205
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,130
the same situation but for iOS 9 and

206
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,410
this is for you to take a look at the

207
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,480
measure that was implemented by Apple to

208
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,459
mitigate that this is basically about

209
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,940
tapping the knees then the link is

210
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,100
similar virtually similar with Japanese

211
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,040
once and then the system asks me what I

212
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,740
want to install it I accepted accepted I

213
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:45,530
say yes and then installation starts

214
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:48,810
however what happens now that if far

215
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:51,510
when I go but once it is installed it

216
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,030
doesn't allow me to run it because it

217
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:57,150
says that it comes from mistrust

218
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,130
developer or untrust developer and it

219
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,800
asked me to do something more something

220
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,790
more is going to this profile and then

221
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,849
to say that

222
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,010
I trust I trust a developer so once you

223
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,080
do that that you set the system that you

224
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:15,240
trust the developers you validate it and

225
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:18,030
then you can run the app so d I this is

226
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,190
being this is giving instruction to

227
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,110
victims and say look if you kind of run

228
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,470
the app don't you worried you go to

229
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,600
adjustment profile then you say that you

230
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:31,010
trust the developer and that's it this

231
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:35,640
is a malware that have assassin umber of

232
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:38,700
instructions with it and then we also

233
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:42,600
mentioned the API is it private ap is

234
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:46,230
that is to sail every private libraries

235
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,950
that are available on iOS that suckers

236
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,840
oh man well creators are using so for

237
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,840
you to have a field basically what they

238
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,320
have found is immoral word dynamically

239
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:00,360
you may invoke classes or objects of

240
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,030
those private classes and then the

241
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,010
review process does not detect that

242
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:08,040
dynamic region of the classes and

243
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:11,069
sometimes the review process of Apple is

244
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:15,540
the scripts of bypassed if i distribute

245
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:18,960
a nap as we have just seen with a cool

246
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,300
bullets certificates of the developer

247
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,550
and if i do that out of the app store

248
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,849
with anyone check whether i am using

249
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:29,189
travel api's or not no one will check

250
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,280
that is sing it so therefore it is a

251
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:34,410
good method if i combine both methods i

252
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,520
can make those architec advantage of the

253
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:41,280
api's and anti will end up distributing

254
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:43,110
my up this is a real example of a

255
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,100
malware which is being distributed in

256
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:50,880
china and websites and it was a link to

257
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:56,040
watch adult movies and here we see the

258
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,380
itms services then the plist then you

259
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,680
clicked on the link and then to download

260
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,020
an app and then your mobile phone was

261
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,500
compromised with very many capacities to

262
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:10,949
find out the app that it's open then to

263
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,470
push ads as you were navigating that is

264
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:16,649
to say to control to gain more and more

265
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:20,430
control of your device mobile device

266
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:23,089
and now to complement that it was very

267
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:27,388
interesting to see that this malwa

268
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:30,300
seaman find a capability that I us had

269
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:34,019
that we didn't know it where you can

270
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,899
hide the app icon so that it doesn't

271
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,910
show so you install the app the malware

272
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:43,069
but you don't see an icon you don't have

273
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:47,790
an icon it is just an instruction in the

274
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:52,439
fiber property file and it is asking the

275
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:54,629
app to hide the icon and why is was that

276
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:56,819
functionality they're available to

277
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:59,129
everyone we could wonder that we

278
00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:01,618
shouldn't we could ask ourselves that

279
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:04,050
but the hospital that's it and then this

280
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:07,079
trick this thing of hiding the icon it

281
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:10,589
is fixed has been fixed by Apple now and

282
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,868
then another way of hiding icons that

283
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:15,569
was also clickable to iOS 9 is this one

284
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:18,509
that says on the screen let me show it

285
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:20,339
to you that basically i take the icon

286
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,290
that i want to hide for instance i take

287
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,569
it to the first screen the festive

288
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,349
screen the first panel is full and then

289
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:32,729
I try to create the icon group and then

290
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:35,490
I drag it down and then it disappears it

291
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:39,449
goes away so now the icon is no longer

292
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:43,529
in what it was in the beginning so this

293
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:47,609
trick works only temporarily if i start

294
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:51,449
the device it shows up again but if i

295
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,939
want to hide and not to hide this icon

296
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,889
to install my malware I could do it in

297
00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:58,050
this fashion because very many people do

298
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:59,939
not take a long time to restart their

299
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,998
mobile phone and now let us talk about

300
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:05,490
the distribution new capacities and

301
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:08,549
vulnerabilities for developers it isn't

302
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,279
it in your hands it isn't your hands to

303
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:16,740
decide whether this is a vulnerability

304
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:19,829
or a new opportunity so is this bug or a

305
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,199
feature it is a feature for those of you

306
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:25,170
who were not clear about it so this is

307
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:29,910
basically about it do you know what WWDC

308
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:33,520
is who knows that what is that

309
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:36,280
perfect it is the annual conference of

310
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:40,900
Apple developers everyone goes there to

311
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,540
see what its latest thing up by Apple so

312
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:47,920
last one took place in San Francisco's

313
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:51,849
summer so 2 million 13 million but today

314
00:15:47,920 --> 00:16:01,900
is stand for but do you think well first

315
00:15:51,850 --> 00:16:05,410
12 million well pop it up users mmm

316
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:08,410
users what Apple have many many more

317
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:13,209
than two million users what else what

318
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:17,230
else could it be developers well they're

319
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:21,610
more developers than two million but

320
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:24,130
stick to it and then market applications

321
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,990
applications in app store yes that

322
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:37,000
stands for the number of apps in

323
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:39,700
appstore and say louder if they had 13

324
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,610
million apps out of the App Store surely

325
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,710
apple will taken back stronger measures

326
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,670
because the business model will be just

327
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:51,970
ruined so 13 million developers

328
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:56,640
registered developers sold two million

329
00:16:51,970 --> 00:17:02,170
apps 13 million registered developers

330
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,329
hmm doesn't does this resonate to you

331
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:08,050
well we could go and say well each

332
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:10,689
developer may have at least one up and

333
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:13,060
what happens with the remaining 11

334
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:15,790
developers why are they developing I

335
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,010
just don't know I don't have any data

336
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,020
supporting that I'm just showing you

337
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,690
this information and it's up to you to

338
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,319
draw your conclusions and then it seems

339
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:28,449
that in the apple development model for

340
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,750
a long time you couldn't really take a

341
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:34,080
nap and then install it in your physical

342
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:37,140
device known as a developer North

343
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,669
locally for that you need to have

344
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,400
developer accounts to work with the

345
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,570
simulator ad but you had to work with an

346
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,460
official development

347
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,570
/ accounts they know who you are you

348
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:53,409
paid to have that account but recently

349
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,389
with the introduction of Xcode they

350
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:58,000
introduced a functionality that is

351
00:17:55,389 --> 00:18:01,779
preferred to a side loading so it means

352
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,929
from your machine through USB you can

353
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:07,210
install an app and for that you don't

354
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:10,380
really need to be an official apple

355
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,570
developer anyone may register as a

356
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,629
developer the free registration to

357
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:19,299
register with an email accounts and then

358
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:22,000
you go ahead and then do you think what

359
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:24,879
you could do with that mechanism that's

360
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,610
a new way of distributing applications

361
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:28,928
out of App Store if I have access to

362
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:33,008
your device for a few seconds I

363
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:36,009
connected with USB to my team and then i

364
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:38,799
just installed this gift for you and if

365
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:41,500
on top of that I've can hide the icon so

366
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,289
you see what I want to get at so this is

367
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,899
as simple as that when you stun it do

368
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:49,389
you see that the screen strings are very

369
00:18:46,899 --> 00:18:51,668
similar to the one that we saw before it

370
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:54,129
asks you whether you want to install the

371
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:57,490
app then you get the profile of the new

372
00:18:54,129 --> 00:19:00,750
developer it is do say that yes that you

373
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:04,419
want to install it so official

374
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:06,519
distributor or developers and non

375
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:10,600
official ones share a number of

376
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:13,629
characteristics parts if you have free

377
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:18,969
developer that you have all you need to

378
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:22,360
distribute malware so sue a cyber allows

379
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:26,470
you to take any up two trillion eyes it

380
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:29,258
with malicious code and then to

381
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:32,409
distributors to distribute it as a valid

382
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:35,019
up through what I said before insisted I

383
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:37,419
loading I take your phone I access to it

384
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:41,350
for 10 seconds and then I access to its

385
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:43,870
USB and then I inject malware the thing

386
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:48,908
is that these well these two could I

387
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:52,959
tell you how it works there is a video

388
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:55,360
so d I may inject the malicious code to

389
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,070
the app and then the app runs perfectly

390
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,199
right with the both

391
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:06,428
the legit legit code and the malware and

392
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:09,399
because the app is the same as the

393
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:13,690
original one but Monty tampered with so

394
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:18,459
it has also access to your details of

395
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:21,789
skype details etc so make it make this

396
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,029
general to any up for instance imagine

397
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:28,120
that it goes to your gmail it will have

398
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:31,629
access to all good information stored on

399
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:37,870
gmail this is a tool that is based on

400
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:41,019
open source tool and you can tamper with

401
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:46,149
it perfectly of rights and well now I

402
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:48,549
will play a quick video so i will tell

403
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:52,059
you how it goes we have the tool a tool

404
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:55,299
that generates the trojan eyes that

405
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:57,820
version for the app you can say i want

406
00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:00,220
to take it skype and i want to inject

407
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,620
this code and this is a code that i

408
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,710
often using intuition test or in

409
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:09,340
security audits where you can inject to

410
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:12,429
manipulate the attempt with the behavior

411
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,769
of the up in the memory i will go fast

412
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:18,669
through the generation side the

413
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:24,639
narration parts variant you sign it with

414
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:27,309
you certificate receive free develop a

415
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:30,668
so here we have skype but we have the

416
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:34,600
tampered with fashion is the test you

417
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:37,269
that it is and trusted develop then you

418
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,149
go to profile adjustment you authorize

419
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:43,179
the developer and this installation

420
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:46,899
process takes only a few seconds we

421
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:50,590
authorize the developer and then we have

422
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:53,678
this skype this skype looks like normal

423
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:58,240
but it is not Norma has the code of the

424
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:00,639
attacker one has infected coordinate and

425
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,129
when we run it because it has this

426
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:06,610
additional code we have the capacity we

427
00:22:03,129 --> 00:22:09,939
can connect to the device and to modify

428
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,809
to change the memory of the app which is

429
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,389
running

430
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,799
so therefore the lunch that will be the

431
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:18,668
attack that will be launching the video

432
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:21,249
shows us how we can change any component

433
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:24,220
of the app so for instance here in the

434
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:27,009
field with a username this is a text

435
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:30,700
that we are sending out to the network

436
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:33,940
through this connection so we'll forward

437
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:36,789
it for a little bit and now you can see

438
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:40,450
how the command is launched and the text

439
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:43,840
that shows up so we are in the framework

440
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:47,980
of we are manipulating we are tampering

441
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:51,309
the memory of iOS apps so basically that

442
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:55,690
we have will have apparently normal

443
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:58,119
skype but Troy a nice to skype so we

444
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:03,509
have skype and now it is being

445
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:06,129
controlled by the attacker so Apple

446
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:10,509
resolve this problem and the same

447
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:12,850
researcher that found this attacking

448
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:15,159
technique found another one as well and

449
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:18,998
the deficit okay now if you've replaced

450
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:21,309
an app that has been modified then you

451
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:23,230
will not have access to the prior data

452
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:24,639
and the technique just patted talk about

453
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,529
the following so that you can see that

454
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:28,629
they're always alternatives okay I'll do

455
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:32,559
a backup of three device I stored data

456
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:38,049
then I installed my skype up try an iced

457
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:42,249
and then I do a dump of a dump the

458
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:45,610
backup of the mobile and now the skype

459
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:48,789
has the very same data but the trillian

460
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:51,908
escape has the very same data so

461
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:56,169
therefore I gain control again of the

462
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:58,659
user details and credentials and I will

463
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:01,230
skip to slice now and now the last

464
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:06,549
jailbreak which is publicly available

465
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:08,980
which is Pangu 9 or 92 or 93 free uses

466
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:11,379
these techniques it uses the side

467
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,659
loading technique that we saw before for

468
00:24:11,379 --> 00:24:16,928
local installation of a nap through USB

469
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:18,940
do Randy up and then it exploits Devon

470
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:21,220
ability and gives you full control of

471
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,920
the device so it is the first time that

472
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:26,470
we'll have a jailbreak with and up

473
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:30,160
doing science and loading instead of

474
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:33,820
exploding it through remotely via iTunes

475
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,890
it has been the case so far so this is a

476
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,669
summary of you can how you can

477
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:42,190
distribute apps out and in the upper

478
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:45,460
school storm so it is very important for

479
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:49,210
you to remember that this long list here

480
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,720
is about the malware up starving in the

481
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:54,730
app store number is not very big but

482
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,010
this is for you to see that the

483
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:00,280
certification process of apps tool can

484
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:04,960
be bypassed allowing the end of the day

485
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:08,980
having people introducing malware apps

486
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,860
and well nine of 10 cases there I'm here

487
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:14,080
we have a higher number in for the apps

488
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,080
that are distributed out of the App

489
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,000
Store so this is the end of the first

490
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,530
parts of the presentation and now I'd

491
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,500
like to tell you about number of

492
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:26,200
vulnerabilities that i have found in iOS

493
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,990
and also in apple mobile environments

494
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:33,550
there have been reported at that time

495
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:37,000
and however perhaps they were not seen

496
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,680
as sufficiently critical and then the

497
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,510
summer time i went back to them and I

498
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,840
said well see what happens with these

499
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:47,620
ones for the later versions of iOS for

500
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,470
iOS 9.3 to and iOS 10 so I just would

501
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,949
like you to reflect about it and then we

502
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:56,650
will see whether Apple should do

503
00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:00,190
something more that we got or not so

504
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:03,220
well apple says that is is one of the

505
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:05,310
most secure devices see mobile devices

506
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,680
and yes we know that they have great

507
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:11,730
capacities with security in claim so

508
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:14,370
well to store the representation of the

509
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,930
fingerprint doing encryption decryption

510
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,909
but perhaps there are other things that

511
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:21,160
should be fixed as well and they are not

512
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:23,380
being fixed and therefore the day I hope

513
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:28,810
that this gives you food for thought so

514
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:30,970
knock you scream it is a main element to

515
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:33,950
protect your device just in case see

516
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:37,010
someone gets hold of it

517
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:40,190
where does vocales para ser voice cut

518
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:42,549
and you need to turn up your vocal cords

519
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:46,070
for voice hacking so voice attacks

520
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:48,679
because we get more and more detail

521
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:52,490
wizards such as Google assistant or

522
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:56,269
Cirie for irons that allow you to

523
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:59,210
interact through the app with this lock

524
00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:02,570
screen well I always been interesting

525
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:05,840
and that was September 2014 and we built

526
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,418
a resource that we have updated on Dino

527
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,480
sack block with each highest version

528
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:14,510
which specific vulnerabilities hull

529
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,850
hours to skip the lock screen so that

530
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,470
you understand and give it in mind this

531
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:22,309
is just an example we've known about

532
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:25,730
this since 2011 with its version it is

533
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:29,210
updated this was actually found by a

534
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:34,519
Spanish researcher by the way it is

535
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:39,470
locked it says six digit pin it was eyes

536
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:43,070
nine then locked again and so the idea

537
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:45,500
is to skip to circumvent it so first

538
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,418
second fourth attempt it's all about by

539
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,029
pattern it and it's our fifth of ten and

540
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:52,970
before we entered the last one it

541
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:56,240
presses home at the same time it is a

542
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:59,419
price condition by present home it

543
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:04,070
activates serum and asks what's the time

544
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:06,169
until it shows you time and time areas

545
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:08,840
or zones and you say well I want a

546
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:12,380
different one when to sin yes you can

547
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,500
enter text to selected and I can select

548
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:18,830
it so you know I want to share it with a

549
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,740
different application let's say SMS I'm

550
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:24,769
sorry all the way into SMS I should not

551
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:28,970
be there from these times and I've moved

552
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:33,799
into SMS so what does an aspen SMS need

553
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:35,899
a text needs and recipient to get it so

554
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:38,559
if there is a recipient I can choose one

555
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:38,559
where from

556
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:50,149
contactless right so if you can choose a

557
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:52,990
recipient I can see the contact I can

558
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:56,299
even create new concepts contacts and

559
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:59,360
that's what i said i'm in the contacts

560
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:02,720
in there what do they have pictures

561
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,490
right so I'm all the way into pictures

562
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,950
into the gallery and you can see all the

563
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,889
pictures and they raised in and whatever

564
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,679
I want so see that's something as simple

565
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:15,320
as saying Siri is enabled because it's

566
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,740
easier and I talked to it on the lock

567
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,779
screen and through the time selection i

568
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,580
can get to contact and can manipulate

569
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:26,299
them all choose the pictures I

570
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,158
manipulate them tamper with them it's

571
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:30,519
just an example one of the many

572
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,350
vulnerabilities that had effect and

573
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,619
still have effectiveness still affect

574
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:40,009
the lock screen another typical question

575
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:43,070
digital certificates we used to encrypt

576
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:46,039
and verify authentication in most of our

577
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:50,509
communications same here if there is no

578
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:52,429
CVE maybe there is no of ulnar ability

579
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:58,149
this is another approach we should

580
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:58,149
consider what's this we have here was it

581
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:09,399
typical case what you get a certificate

582
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:11,740
mistake because Genevieve validate it

583
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:14,379
does not trustworthy three options here

584
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:19,630
you can cancel go into details or move

585
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:21,429
on if you go into details and check out

586
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,340
the details when you say I trust a

587
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:28,960
certificate what does it end the user

588
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:32,049
Amin let me tell Jean double button for

589
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,480
mass destruction right what was that so

590
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:37,570
this is a nuclear panic bottom we all

591
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,990
fear someone might press and that's all

592
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:43,870
I'm going to say about it what just

593
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:49,269
happened if you've pressed any of these

594
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:52,268
two buttons your eyes device has

595
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:55,480
accepted to certificate as valid and so

596
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:57,850
you can log in and a potential attacker

597
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:02,919
ething charge of the certificate will

598
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:06,070
capture our traffic for how long is it

599
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:09,490
valid that's certificate sorry what do

600
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:13,629
you reply say so out that forever and

601
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:17,139
ever forever means but it'll be dear

602
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:18,809
your attacker able to attack the traffic

603
00:31:17,139 --> 00:31:21,779
for the website whenever they want

604
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:24,850
unless you've got the factory settings

605
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:30,279
restored doesn't matter you delete the

606
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:31,990
history that you rebooted the system did

607
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:36,809
browser does another it'll be there

608
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:40,090
forever this is serious life same here

609
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:44,500
basically we are over there these

610
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:46,809
desires we log on to the web you've got

611
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,809
a money to me to attack the reason

612
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:53,019
invalid attack certificate and so

613
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:54,789
there's a certificate error and we get

614
00:31:53,019 --> 00:32:01,870
to details but we don't accept it so far

615
00:31:54,789 --> 00:32:04,389
so good so what happens if I do press

616
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:08,469
accept so back to the beginning log in

617
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:10,010
same certificate error if I say move on

618
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,140
that's it

619
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,510
I just do it once and the attacker is

620
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:18,800
already intercepting my whole save a

621
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:22,610
cheap secure HTTP d TPS traffic doesn't

622
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:25,520
matter whether we deleted all that

623
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:29,179
certificate and even if we delete it and

624
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:32,240
we go back in there are we wrong know

625
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,010
where the money is in the middle getting

626
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,170
all level traffic how can we delete it

627
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:40,490
there's only one option that is doing it

628
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:43,070
big go to settings and delete all

629
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:46,250
network settings or all the settings and

630
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:49,010
it defines if you delete it I lose all

631
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:51,050
the Wi-Fi networks that were set up and

632
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:56,620
so many other elements we're going to be

633
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:59,840
easier iight wonder it is 2016 to a half

634
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,129
this panel saying these are the

635
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,990
certificates you accept it and then

636
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:05,780
delete the one stitches I don't think

637
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,100
it's too much our skin but it seems it

638
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:13,730
is because we don't have the

639
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:16,699
capabilities so something else that it's

640
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,890
interesting for security is to keep your

641
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,380
device updated then we all know that it

642
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:27,770
makes sense if a vulnerability gets a CV

643
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:31,100
there is an idea is alerted and so my

644
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:33,110
factory has repaired and we can sleep it

645
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,649
is right what do you think can we

646
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:39,379
slipped I'd just like that who verifies

647
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,780
whether a vulnerability that the

648
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,480
manufacturer claims been sorted out it's

649
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:48,530
been actually resolved sometimes that

650
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,900
nagging researcher that is using months

651
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:54,470
to look into it is the one who checks

652
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:57,920
whether it's been and it's been a damn

653
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:00,530
and the nagging one that's me so the

654
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,930
repairs might not be adequate may be

655
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:06,139
brittle is will not work but you know

656
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:08,750
what I mean so I did conduct some

657
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,820
researchers with iOS are obtained say

658
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,620
where they could be tampered we've when

659
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,629
you could freeze your iOS device and

660
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:17,299
basically make sure it would never

661
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:19,639
update again it was notified to uphold

662
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,870
they deep repair it but only partially

663
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,500
there was a seaman

664
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:26,870
that was the device could be attack and

665
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,940
you keep circumvent the current am plain

666
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,770
meaning there is this one version

667
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,540
there's a new one released and you say

668
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,370
your device know you've got the last one

669
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,380
but it doesn't update since it's not

670
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,270
updated to the new one the new one is

671
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,670
public you can see the exploit for the

672
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,100
new one and can attack them under device

673
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,600
so there is an impact if it was even

674
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,159
worse in the past of course when you

675
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:52,009
could tell say do not update until 2013

676
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,629
30 sorry and so getting up to 20 30 i

677
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,520
have plenty of updates but still

678
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:59,780
important so you still chasing hit

679
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,330
reporting it back to apple and what's

680
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,970
interesting and i found it later on is

681
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:08,420
the fact that Apple watch this is

682
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,879
SmartWatch would update in the same way

683
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,710
and was vulnerable to the same items so

684
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,170
you could attack it and freeze the

685
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:18,140
update same as with a phone remember

686
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:20,270
what I said same cloud inherited from

687
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,400
different devices that inherit

688
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:25,220
vulnerabilities this is another problem

689
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:29,090
than its solvent within the industry it

690
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:32,600
is an example just briefly I will have

691
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:35,180
access team well let me have access to

692
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:42,680
say didn't see the version at the time

693
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:45,529
of the video it was eyes 93 tree so

694
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,810
fully updated back then there was no huh

695
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:51,830
and now there's been an attack am on the

696
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:57,440
watch the watch version was 211 as you

697
00:35:51,830 --> 00:36:00,170
can see I'm sorry you can see that the

698
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,260
watch for the tests I had a an older

699
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,970
version i think it was 20 i'm not sure

700
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,160
what it was saved in a minute and it's

701
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:10,129
trying to obtain so there's been an

702
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:13,370
attack they're released and you see 20

703
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:15,740
is the last latest and no the truth is

704
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:20,930
that it was 211 and so it was still

705
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:26,689
vulnerable same as iphone and ipad

706
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:31,399
devices where likely 4 is 10 finally

707
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:34,250
Apple stopped it using HTTPS for all the

708
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,490
communication regarding software updates

709
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:40,550
so it is a bit more limited or somehow

710
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:43,609
there is attack mitigation meaning that

711
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,380
all of few that raise your hands saying

712
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,060
that we are doing worse what what I mean

713
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,130
is that there is light at the end of the

714
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,410
tunnel and if we researchers keep

715
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,420
insisting on manufacturers for them to

716
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:56,450
do things right it seems in the end we

717
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:01,520
will manage so I guess it is a good

718
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:06,109
message to keep on insisting and before

719
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,720
Q&A let me finish with Wi-Fi quite

720
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:16,580
common in the daily use of mobile

721
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:18,919
devices and so out of the vulnerability

722
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:21,380
supported is spotted and reported back

723
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,600
to manufacturers his let me remind you

724
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,610
these initial list of vulnerabilities we

725
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,950
did the maths and understood why they

726
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:30,800
would go up other ones officially

727
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:34,009
recognized by the manufacturer but many

728
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,500
other errands as this one or the one we

729
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:40,070
just checked with the web browser that

730
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,230
it was not acknowledged either so the

731
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:46,070
ones that are acknowledged recognized

732
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:48,710
are the very critical ones let's see if

733
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:52,340
that's the case different research

734
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:54,620
conducted for Wi-Fi networks and mobile

735
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,390
devices we found a few vulnerabilities

736
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:59,150
there's this one on which will be

737
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:02,330
focusing where you can have a full sir

738
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:04,850
hotspot and you're spoofing the

739
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:07,370
legitimate one so the mobile believes

740
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:09,230
that what's visible is a one for your

741
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:11,299
organization but it's actually a fourth

742
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:13,610
one that it's taking the place of your

743
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,470
the one of your organization it will be

744
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,690
connected and the attacker will

745
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:19,910
eventually intersect your communication

746
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:23,120
and as part of my analysis I had this

747
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:26,420
fun fact there were series of scenarios

748
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,520
and when the device locks into the Wi-Fi

749
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,460
network and finds the false hotspot I'm

750
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,820
not men in here open Wi-Fi right but the

751
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:39,950
top is the highest Wi-Fi Wi-Fi security

752
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:43,610
business wapt level it's there it can be

753
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:47,569
that there is a certificate mistake or

754
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:49,009
error sent by the issuer so when

755
00:38:47,569 --> 00:38:54,459
see the certificate what are the options

756
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:58,910
you can accept it a certificate or

757
00:38:54,459 --> 00:39:03,859
accepted it since it is something reason

758
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:06,170
right a counselor or not accept well

759
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:08,808
that was it there was no content as a

760
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:11,269
fun fact but Michael sentence was a

761
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:13,069
given this cve because that comes out

762
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:14,779
button was missing probably I don't know

763
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:17,390
he was at one of my presentations or he

764
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:19,549
found it himself and Apple said this is

765
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:25,479
a serious vulnerability we need that

766
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:25,479
button there still as it happens the

767
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:33,709
core of the vulnerability was basically

768
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:37,069
that option of the spoofing theme Wi-Fi

769
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:41,690
network so that decline device if not

770
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:43,549
properly set up it can it's locks onto

771
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:49,190
the Wi-Fi network and reveals the

772
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:51,739
deepest secrets let me a tale m this is

773
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:55,059
a business net word you've got username

774
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:57,410
and password and you can get the server

775
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,839
certificate you may validate it or not

776
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:02,328
same with the website you can cancel it

777
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,839
here it is that bottom here in this

778
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:09,109
specific scenario and problem is an

779
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,900
attacker could impersonate could prove

780
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:13,519
your companies and certificate in fear

781
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,489
virtually the same it's only the

782
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,198
fingerprint that cannot be faked the

783
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:19,789
cryptographic one but they can say they

784
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:21,519
are part of your organization that it's

785
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:25,969
been issued by the same certifying

786
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:30,468
entity etc so once you set the attack

787
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:34,190
scenario building a full hot spot or a

788
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:37,430
tax spot what do you get this is the

789
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:40,640
Wi-Fi it's on the reserve force attack

790
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:44,058
spot the mobile device thinks this legit

791
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,479
and transou log and so if there is a

792
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:51,410
radio certificate that the user accepts

793
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:55,399
what happens what do you think just the

794
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:57,799
same as with the web browser stays in

795
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,509
there forever and it's a valid

796
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:00,920
certificate for ever and ever it's

797
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:02,780
probably the same code

798
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,600
these processing certificates other ones

799
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:08,390
would get an attack at them doom let me

800
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,210
show you so there's this false hotspot

801
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:16,400
the client or move battle divine stripes

802
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:18,650
do you like and what happens it it it is

803
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,290
because of the false hot spot that you

804
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:23,060
force the client to reveal in the

805
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:25,520
credentials of the user that will

806
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,920
username and password and in the

807
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,920
business network operator is not just

808
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:39,590
the Wi-Fi but it's also windows it is in

809
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:42,380
email and web servers this one has no cv

810
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:45,410
cancel the one with cancel yes this is

811
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,900
not an been acknowledged and yet the

812
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:51,710
oztent is still vulnerable so take it as

813
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:57,310
you will as of late I like to finish my

814
00:41:51,710 --> 00:42:01,010
presentations using some tiny saying so

815
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:02,980
this is a saying in spanish and we've

816
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:08,210
seen so many outside doors and apples

817
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:11,870
you might know this saying an apple a

818
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,580
day keeps the doctor away some here it

819
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:18,290
is an apple a day keeps doing to other

820
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:21,080
away lipid layer and and take it as you

821
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:24,470
will we are done here if you have

822
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,710
questions I'll be happy to take them hrf

823
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,709
yes

824
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:56,020
but a OneTouch questions comments

825
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:57,580
remarks no questions I'll try to hear I

826
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:11,400
want you say and I'll repeat the

827
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:15,759
question myself it is even worse than

828
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:21,160
one could initially picture so you have

829
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:24,220
to default set up and back so the

830
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:27,370
certificates go away that's good and

831
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:30,459
it's nice that it gets deleted if you

832
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:33,370
restore from your backup but the backup

833
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,990
you've got it was after accepting the

834
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:37,270
certificate the certificate comes back

835
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:39,580
and it's like separate isvalid it's not

836
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,860
just that if you update the operating

837
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:44,049
system an update seems quite quite

838
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,810
important for the system right still

839
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:50,860
vulnerable in all the tests that i

840
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:53,620
mentioned i did it again this year 93

841
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,170
teen ad updated it to 10 and the same

842
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:58,930
certificate you saw on the clip it was

843
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:01,330
still on 10 and it was still vulnerable

844
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:06,240
without that certificate error so you

845
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:08,230
need to reset default factory setting or

846
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,629
there is no other option there's no

847
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:18,400
manual a deleting option any more

848
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:21,360
questions comments this one so ask me

849
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,360
one as you get the microphone

850
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:30,150
I got in a bit late I would like to know

851
00:44:27,029 --> 00:44:32,999
if later today or maybe tomorrow we will

852
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:34,950
give the same presentation and unluckily

853
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:37,439
i should I was not supposed to be here

854
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:40,828
but I am and I'm happy to be but it

855
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,979
seems that was them mmm mix-up with the

856
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:46,349
presentation I will not repeat it and

857
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:48,930
all all what I've said here will be

858
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:52,559
available do you have leaflets yes there

859
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:55,019
will be the whole presentation will be

860
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:57,779
there plus and something else saying if

861
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:59,279
you want to look deeper into it congrats

862
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:01,799
on the presentations been so very

863
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:05,130
interesting let me just tell you that

864
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:07,499
Apple maybe it's consolation for Apple

865
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:10,170
and they don't acknowledge it but the

866
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:13,618
radius and fishing is for everyone for

867
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:17,489
computers and Android everyone well let

868
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:21,809
me add something this vulnerability that

869
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:24,960
this spoofing or fishing is from 2008 a

870
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:28,019
dear friend joso right and done Antony

871
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,019
of its different researcher that talk

872
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:33,868
about it back in 20 A's so it was 88

873
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:36,508
years ago then we looked into the mobile

874
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:40,249
side of agency if we had learned from

875
00:45:36,509 --> 00:45:42,660
the past and luckily in initial and

876
00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:44,910
research we saw that all of them whined

877
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:48,180
windows phone blackberry is all of them

878
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:50,098
were vulnerable and maybe this one was

879
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,680
the most best one because you need to

880
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:54,719
have a CA they do bit better as for

881
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,618
android there's a problem because you

882
00:45:54,719 --> 00:46:00,450
cannot specify the radius server name so

883
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:04,710
inherited and we will look into it for

884
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:07,828
android 2 4 5 6 7 and it's just the same

885
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:11,999
same for ayer's and what it mean is not

886
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:15,029
that Apple is the evilest evil mm more

887
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:17,218
villain but they are all affected the

888
00:46:15,029 --> 00:46:19,529
technology we have nowadays is very

889
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:22,710
complex we are too dependent on

890
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:25,259
technology sometimes way too much and I

891
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,430
do fancy technology have to say it but

892
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:29,069
we also need to admit it and

893
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:31,140
manufacturers industry as a whole need

894
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:33,900
to get ready there are things that need

895
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,759
to be something that are numb for very

896
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,710
long many

897
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:40,970
years when we need to solve an amp how

898
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:43,100
dumb at home user can set up a business

899
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,740
network when there will be no radios at

900
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:48,890
home but there is an option that you can

901
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:52,609
only set up with a dmt through the

902
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:56,509
device profile options it's as simple as

903
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:59,420
that but it's not done there is this

904
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:03,020
conspiracy theory and lion are who knows

905
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:07,070
and you decide but things need to be

906
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:11,870
solved more questions comments a few

907
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:14,570
more back there the one closest certain

908
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:19,900
to me ask you a question and then you

909
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:19,900
will take the mic to you the next person

910
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:31,760
let me explain you how it works if you

911
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:33,920
go to dinah sec www Dino spike com you

912
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,160
go to the app and you see a few

913
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,770
presentations and and technical data but

914
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:42,140
that would be it if you've got the

915
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:45,680
radius server but you you're the false

916
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:50,750
one almost all Wi-Fi clients for windows

917
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:53,899
compatibility is clear as the bin as ID

918
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:56,300
system so you use version number two the

919
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:59,210
same as when you have betrayed folders

920
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:01,400
it on windows so with that radius

921
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:04,160
instead of saying that I have a pain I

922
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,530
saying well if it's this I have to

923
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:09,109
change the challenge and response and

924
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:11,870
too big a mask why don't you use pop

925
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:15,920
which is a protocol that if you are

926
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:19,190
older back then when we had modems the

927
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,480
ones that had that sound that maybe some

928
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:22,390
of you in the room that know what I'm

929
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,100
talking about but when we were

930
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:27,620
authenticating we had pup and chap it is

931
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:31,549
pop the one so send me their credentials

932
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:34,279
am plain and clear so if mr. radius says

933
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:37,130
I need to send them plain and clear I do

934
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:41,900
so no need to crack them no need to do

935
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:46,430
anything else it's a sadist and just set

936
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:49,490
our kids will work in security for sure

937
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:52,879
in Spain there is no awareness but in in

938
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:56,058
the US this no one is there someone

939
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:01,130
who's looking to vulnerability and dare

940
00:48:56,059 --> 00:49:03,109
to say it out loud you are risking my

941
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:05,119
security you are the manufacturer you

942
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:08,779
need to take care of my security no one

943
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:12,319
there I'm the lawyer I mean not to be a

944
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:15,589
lawyer I will not get into that turf but

945
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:19,700
it is true in the industry not now but

946
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:21,170
recently we see who is to be held

947
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,240
accountable for many of the vulnerable

948
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:25,700
technologies that we have and that can

949
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,919
cause quite a problem then recent

950
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:31,250
example has been the botnet network for

951
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,490
the i/o team where we see the main

952
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:38,660
surfaces of the internet were crashed

953
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:42,169
and Twitter and others so the thing is

954
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:45,348
let's see what the limits easy and to

955
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:47,540
the responsibility is and we see both

956
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:50,839
words are too far apart we're moving

957
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:52,790
very fast and technology compared to the

958
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:54,920
legal side of it and we'll see what

959
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:57,020
happens even though the u.s. is a good

960
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,150
way whether you get a lung cancer

961
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,339
because you're smoking and even if you

962
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:03,559
know it because it was advertised on the

963
00:50:01,339 --> 00:50:05,480
package you can also see the

964
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:08,210
manufacturer not the case in the Spain

965
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,210
but still the V no known cases where the

966
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:15,369
responsibility has fallen on the

967
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:22,630
manufacturer we see what happens

968
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:22,630
questions good m

969
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:37,730
most of the users iPhone users they use

970
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:41,300
Cydia for downloading apps the they have

971
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:43,280
trust with your reliable certificates

972
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:46,640
won't let me swing most of iphone users

973
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,220
who had not jailbreak broken their their

974
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,470
their computers so factory settings they

975
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,060
they only download it from the app store

976
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:56,600
or the techniques I said if you

977
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:59,210
jailbreak your iphone for full control

978
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,549
by default you've got cydia that is a

979
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:05,270
package manager and we haven't discussed

980
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:09,470
it because it's open a new range who

981
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:13,400
gives you the apps through Syria how

982
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:16,459
reliable are them they are not anyone

983
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,810
can distribute those apps if there's

984
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:21,350
something malicious they'll remove it

985
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:24,040
but that's it I've never said that the

986
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:27,410
malware that was distributed was are on

987
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:35,570
jailbroken devices in that case the

988
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:37,899
compromise risk is much higher more

989
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,900
questions

990
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:15,680
now that we've cell phones we can pay so

991
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:18,799
we can pay with our and mobile NFC see

992
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,078
with the iphone and android so there's

993
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:22,609
legal implications we said before were

994
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:25,339
depending on the bank the transaction

995
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:27,920
and how it is detected it will be

996
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:32,359
compensated by the bank or naughty nurse

997
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:34,280
and technically what's the module

998
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:37,549
analysis and manufacturers strike to do

999
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:40,549
it rise and so the most recent Android

1000
00:52:37,549 --> 00:52:42,799
and iOS half this cryptographic Howard

1001
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:44,690
cheap that is in charge of those tasks

1002
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:48,259
but it's just another hard wood chip

1003
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:50,270
that is controlled by software on the OS

1004
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:53,119
and firmware which is somewhere on the

1005
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:56,450
hardwood so there's been some research

1006
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:59,839
but no public research has released any

1007
00:52:56,450 --> 00:53:04,189
idea that you can pay by tampering with

1008
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:06,619
the mobile with NFC and by of course

1009
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:08,990
supplicating or replicating the card you

1010
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:11,150
can I think there is an speaker later on

1011
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:13,520
who will not discuss that topic but

1012
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:15,710
other times he is disgusted I'm he's a

1013
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,390
well and knowledgeable and it's not

1014
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:20,599
about the problem the room is not about

1015
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:23,089
mobile but about the wireless technology

1016
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:27,470
so banks understood that need to be

1017
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:30,589
painless wireless payments and 20 years

1018
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:32,868
and so there they take up the risk to

1019
00:53:30,589 --> 00:53:36,460
make this technology popular it is just

1020
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:38,990
a business decision any more questions

1021
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,980
if not slow thank you very much to all

1022
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:45,459
of you it's been a pleasure

1023
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:45,460
[Applause]
