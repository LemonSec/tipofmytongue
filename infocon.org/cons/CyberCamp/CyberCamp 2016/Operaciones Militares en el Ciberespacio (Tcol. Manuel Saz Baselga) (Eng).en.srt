1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:11,309
good morning first of all I would like

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,469
to thank in cv for having invited the

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,139
giant comment of cyber defense for

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,350
inviting us to these meeting and for

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:22,220
giving us the opportunity to share what

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,430
we do in terms of the cyber space sim

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:30,348
and mine will is manual sense the bat

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:33,390
sega i am a me lieutenant colonel and

9
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:36,000
i'm here to tell you how we understand

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,000
several space and also to show you what

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,160
are our capabilities of emissions and

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,010
what is the understanding that will have

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,599
of army operations first of all we'll

14
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,329
have to ask ourselves the following

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,079
question is the surveillance place a new

16
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:58,829
battleground well sometimes we could

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,980
think that in cyberspace we only find a

18
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,799
criminal activities and from the

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,689
viewpoints of citizens that's what we

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,490
are as seeing more and more however we

21
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,990
should also think about the power of

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,619
nations a power of nations and whether

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,220
that power is now being implemented not

24
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,640
only and in the physical sphere but also

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,650
in the cyberspace and now a number of

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,000
characteristics that will help us

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,979
identify whether we will be facing

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,799
conflict in the cyberspace as we all

29
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,439
know the cyberspace is a virtual

30
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,740
environment with no geographical limits

31
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,520
and what is the consequence of that it

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:52,020
is that several actors in different

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,710
places in the world have the take action

34
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:59,250
in other places other places that with

35
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,490
no geographical boundaries another

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,189
command component is that the devices

37
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,818
that are being used in the cyberspace

38
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:13,549
well not originally designed for them to

39
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:15,470
be secure but to be fast and efficient

40
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:20,230
we'll have these two components and if

41
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,230
we add to that that in cyber space

42
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,330
essential vital activities for navigate

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,420
societies are being carried out there

44
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:32,870
well we're starting to see a breeding

45
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:37,510
ground here so there are activities such

46
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:41,780
as health transportation economy energy

47
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:45,739
all those sectors are supported in

48
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,950
technologies that are located on the

49
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,740
cyberspace so therefore there are highly

50
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,280
valuable elements in the cyberspace and

51
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:59,300
that cyberspace is not a secure place

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:04,910
and if this is not a secure place we

53
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:07,280
will be finding situations that happen

54
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:09,829
in the physical world and they have the

55
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,150
counterpart in the cyber space and with

56
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:17,959
this and mean crime terrorism and

57
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:23,060
espionage crime looking for fast

58
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:27,230
economic benefits terrorism it is based

59
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:31,280
and supported selfing and Nanami tea and

60
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:37,850
then espionage espionage that is to say

61
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:40,850
using be honest and why that espionage

62
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,910
is based on gathering sensitive

63
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:47,660
information important information either

64
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:51,829
from States from governments or for from

65
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:56,329
industries corporations many years ago

66
00:03:51,830 --> 00:04:02,170
that sensitive information was on paper

67
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:04,760
and used to be kept in sales therefore

68
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:08,238
nowadays it is not it is not the case

69
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:12,459
anymore and therefore the Espionage

70
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,050
services of several states are

71
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:19,180
strengthening the efforts in terms of

72
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:21,978
espionage so we are seeing now oh well

73
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,930
many more components of cyberspace the

74
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:28,289
next component characteristics

75
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:30,680
I'm conflicts is there an interest to

76
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:36,080
deploy armed conflicts on the cyberspace

77
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:40,080
an armed conflict is conflict a

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,349
nonprofit between two states that is to

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:50,758
say one state trying to impose its power

80
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:54,900
over the other and cyberspace does it

81
00:04:50,759 --> 00:05:00,539
allow come state to do that yes it does

82
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:04,979
and how do powerful states use it use it

83
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:08,400
to impose their will and power to do

84
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:11,449
this and now we also have states that

85
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,150
are not very strong and by developing

86
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:19,110
tools they may end up imposing the

87
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:23,008
Willard power over more powerful states

88
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:26,039
and now let us add to the list of

89
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:29,010
characteristics this very last one no

90
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,199
arm control no weapon control in the

91
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:33,599
physical world we are aware of the

92
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,210
company's manufacturing weapons being

93
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:40,139
have record as to how they are

94
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,940
distributed to whom but here in the

95
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,580
cyberspace there is no control

96
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,610
whatsoever I may develop I can't develop

97
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,039
a cyber weapon and I can say leaves and

98
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,440
there is no control over it and I can

99
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:56,340
stir it i don't need the big storage

100
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,820
facility to stall cyber weapon and cyber

101
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,039
weapon have consequences consequences in

102
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,199
the cyber world and these consequences

103
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,750
and doubling translators in the physical

104
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:14,250
world as well and then one more

105
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:16,139
components the anonymity so we are all

106
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,389
very well aware of the consequences of

107
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,310
being anonymous on the internet versus

108
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,949
being anonymous in the real world in the

109
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,530
real world it is difficult to be

110
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:30,300
anonymous bash in the virtual world it

111
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:32,580
is not as difficult so are we going to

112
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,889
have a armed conflicts here yes of

113
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,130
course and then the legal framework is

114
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,820
that a legal framework for cyberspace at

115
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,860
international

116
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,690
level there is no legal framework at a

117
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,520
national level yes there is a legal

118
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,500
framework but not on the countries have

119
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,380
a legal framework that sustained have a

120
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,590
legal framework for cyberspace yes it is

121
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:56,730
is it easy to amin to being implemented

122
00:06:52,590 --> 00:07:03,049
no it is not easy because of anonymity

123
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:06,030
because issues with attribution so

124
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,340
that's a situation that we face is the

125
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,599
army Val yes of course we are very much

126
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:16,679
present there so our framework reference

127
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,680
is NATO so let us see how the length of

128
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,280
defines the savage space it is defined

129
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,680
as a global domain and this is extremely

130
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,150
important for us global domain what does

131
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,750
it mean it means that it is being

132
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:34,260
separated from the rest of the domains

133
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:38,880
so we have the army the Navy the Air

134
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:42,510
Force land sea air space and now we have

135
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,090
a new domain the global Dominion that's

136
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:48,840
here where we will have the activities

137
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:52,710
of the army of the NATO forces deployed

138
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,799
that where the NATO forces will deploy

139
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:59,640
their activities in this global Dominion

140
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,240
and then it is say that it is made up by

141
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,890
RTC systems as well as other electronic

142
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,270
systems and their interaction and

143
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:12,750
information is stored and transmitted

144
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:15,090
and now I'd like to review with you two

145
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,310
more definitions which is very important

146
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:23,299
to understand them to move on with our

147
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:27,360
talk cyber world when we read the papers

148
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:30,870
we read cyberwar ensayo there is a cyber

149
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,680
war between the US and Russia is there

150
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:37,229
an actual cyber war in the cyberspace

151
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:40,020
after this conference after this doctor

152
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:42,120
would like you to be clear how about

153
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,610
this concept well sometimes we talk

154
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,950
lately about these cyber boarding the

155
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:50,010
cyberspace what are we talking about are

156
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,420
we talking about two steaks two nature's

157
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:56,500
fading we fighting with each other

158
00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:00,610
well and Isis has been so far has always

159
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,250
been so on land by the time the moment

160
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,410
we started to see human activity on land

161
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,930
we started to see groups of interest

162
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:11,740
nations some we started to see armed

163
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:14,380
conflicts then that was that dimension

164
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:19,269
was transferred or was started to be

165
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:22,689
seen on C and then air it was a bit more

166
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:27,699
complex at sea than on land but it

167
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:32,709
reached the sea dimension then the air

168
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:34,810
and space this is well this conflict

169
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:38,050
became more and more because more

170
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:40,899
complex systems when needed to take the

171
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:44,920
unconference through the space and then

172
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:48,880
another new dimension the space many

173
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,490
outer space some countries have not

174
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,519
reached there because they so far they

175
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,110
haven't had the economic or financial

176
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,360
capabilities to do it as you can see all

177
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,240
these emotions become increasingly

178
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,410
complex and now we have the cyberspace

179
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,540
is this more complex yes it is very

180
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:10,269
complex can we really develop offensive

181
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,160
capabilities for this new demand no it

182
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:14,380
is not difficult it is relatively easy

183
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,899
you don't really need very many

184
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:18,850
financial resources to do it and I'm

185
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:22,750
saying this so that you have a better

186
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:26,110
understanding us to see how states are

187
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:29,440
using the run forces to fight the

188
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:33,040
threads in cyberspace so now what are

189
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,850
these threats in cyberspace threats that

190
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,910
we suffer we suffer them all citizens in

191
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:43,410
our nation's and the threats that we

192
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,410
suffer a summation

193
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:54,140
so these are the threats to our whatever

194
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,839
of them here we have different threats

195
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,330
to have different techniques sometimes

196
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:04,100
the techniques are confused with the

197
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:07,190
actual threat but here at like he like

198
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,610
to take four groups cybercrime we are

199
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:13,010
all victims of it then activism

200
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:19,390
developed in cyberspace that is to say

201
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:19,390
hacktivism cyber espionage inside of war

202
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:28,460
threats well threads are those for that

203
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,210
I mentioned before let us look at them

204
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:35,870
in greater detail we charting most

205
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:39,050
dangerous so threats well we could tend

206
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:42,230
to think that cyber criminals criminals

207
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,540
are the most dangerous not actually know

208
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,340
these states are the most dangerous

209
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,599
because they have the personal and the

210
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:52,820
resources to make these threats and they

211
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,940
also have the time we have the time to

212
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:59,780
do it and to develop the activities and

213
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:02,810
they also carry out and lead operations

214
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:06,199
whenever they need it they are kind of

215
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:10,489
active world and these operations can be

216
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,920
directly and managed to buy them or

217
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:16,430
through third parties what are other

218
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,030
actors here will have the transnational

219
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:21,890
actors we should not forget there are no

220
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:25,459
boundaries here there are no frontiers

221
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:30,430
and there are groups of people who are

222
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:35,210
active on the internet whose aim is to

223
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:39,380
carry out hacktivism oh just to carry

224
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:44,720
out terrorist acts and criminal

225
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:48,140
organizations they are not limited by

226
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:54,880
any boundaries their objective is a

227
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:58,180
financial game games their campaigns are

228
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,720
have consequences to all of us impact us

229
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:06,849
all and on top of that these

230
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:11,290
organizations could also share the

231
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:13,000
services or work for states or 4d groups

232
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,800
that we mentioned before so this

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,040
criminal organization sometimes can work

234
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,680
for States and then we have the

235
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,949
individual players or small groups they

236
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,410
are driven by several motivations

237
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,680
different motivations and what is the

238
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:33,310
tanger the danger is that may work for

239
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,150
any of the previous groups and after

240
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:40,959
seeing the threats and background that I

241
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:45,160
gave you before now we see their cyber

242
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:49,270
weapons are not expensive and then if we

243
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:53,079
add to it that high efficiency we end up

244
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:57,550
having a significant asymmetry we the

245
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:01,780
army do not like to have an asymmetric

246
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:04,540
rival we like to have a rival that is

247
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:08,500
appear and that we that is at the same

248
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:12,069
level but it is not the case so

249
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,130
distribution notion of attacks these are

250
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,860
sources for this year 2016 this is the

251
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:20,080
distribution this is what will have to

252
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:26,770
face on a day-to-day basis on a daily

253
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:30,220
basis we primarily face cyber crime here

254
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:34,510
in hacktivism we don't have to face it

255
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:38,590
as much we here we this is more

256
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:41,290
state-related sometimes these hacktivism

257
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:44,470
groups they are against this state they

258
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:48,010
tried to push for their ideas and we are

259
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:51,310
most impacted by all cyber espionage and

260
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:55,090
cyber warfare we are Spanish nations we

261
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:58,479
haven't been victims of any SATA were so

262
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:00,240
far and now we move on after seeing the

263
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,610
threats now that has to cover the

264
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,490
missions the purposes and the capacity

265
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:10,680
of the joint commands of cyber defense

266
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,680
what is our mission and what are the

267
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:18,060
capacities that we have developed to for

268
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:24,089
it our mission is given to us by Royal

269
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:26,250
Decree 872 Dodge 2014 that degree as

270
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:29,790
being established by the armed forces

271
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:34,950
and this includes the joint command of

272
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:38,130
the cyber defense and we are giving two

273
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:40,730
missions here to carry out server

274
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,550
defense actions that is to say to defend

275
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:46,529
defending our networks and the networks

276
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:50,189
of the ministry for defense this is

277
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:54,180
important we defend our networks or

278
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:56,880
those that we are asked to defend that's

279
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,310
our main area of what defense of our

280
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,040
networks and we have also been given

281
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:07,260
another mission that being given

282
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,719
adequate adequate response when we say

283
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,089
adequate adequate a synonym with legal

284
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,370
and with other things we have to give

285
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:17,130
adequate response in the Cerberus case

286
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:22,550
it's travel space in the face of threats

287
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:27,380
who aggressions and our mission has been

288
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,380
granted to us through the Royal Decree

289
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,479
what are the capacities that we have

290
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,360
developed to carry out our mission we

291
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:41,150
have developed a defensive capacity this

292
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:44,400
is the first one that we developed and

293
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:48,079
it includes number of preventative

294
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:52,199
proactive and reactive measures then an

295
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:55,410
exploitation capacity so we should not

296
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,650
extrapolate it and think that these

297
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:01,439
refers to exploit or vulnerabilities not

298
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:04,859
at all exploitation means that we want

299
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,650
to be aware of the situation in the

300
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:11,219
cyberspace in the area where we will be

301
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:13,050
working what for to produce to develop

302
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,550
intelligence to find out about the

303
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,550
intentions of potential attacker

304
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:23,250
and then to promote to foster early

305
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:27,639
alarm and the third one is response

306
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,320
response has to be adequate as I

307
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,730
mentioned before that means that it

308
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,830
should be legit should be according to

309
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,600
law we don't break the law in the

310
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:46,300
physical world and we should not break

311
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:54,370
the law in the cyberspace response

312
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:58,450
should be legit and abortion timely is

313
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:03,459
it legit to defend myself or to respond

314
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:07,720
with the same cyber attack first of all

315
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:10,270
I need to attribute that attack to do

316
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,260
the attacker sometimes it's like six

317
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:17,080
months and having the IP address of the

318
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,870
machine is not enough I need to

319
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,720
attribute it to a physical person you

320
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,209
need to attribute this cyber person to a

321
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,550
physical person that could be very

322
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,460
complicated sometimes it takes six

323
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:34,090
months for me to attribute the cyber

324
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:39,010
attack and do I respond well I responds

325
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:41,260
as long as it is opportune and six

326
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,230
months later it's not approaching and

327
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,450
then the response has to be

328
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:49,210
proportionate I cannot really cause huge

329
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:52,090
damage to those that have attacked me

330
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:54,250
these are three limits three limits that

331
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:59,139
we have when it comes to giving a

332
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:02,320
response now defense capacities I will

333
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,290
be fast through this section and because

334
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,620
I'm sure that most of you here have done

335
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,600
this before and you are well aware of it

336
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,540
preventive measures we work in terms of

337
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:19,929
physical security will have access

338
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:24,190
control so we try to contain printers

339
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:27,160
they are taxed also upgrading of

340
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,909
applications anti viruses these are

341
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,450
preventative actions that are more

342
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:37,279
were used but most of the organization's

343
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:39,499
of people involved in defense capacities

344
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,979
and we also work in systems security

345
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:47,509
shin we make them secure from the design

346
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:50,720
we also carry out analysis to detect

347
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:54,259
vulnerabilities to fix them we also do

348
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:58,070
lots of training both nationally and

349
00:19:54,259 --> 00:20:00,619
internationally we also start with

350
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:03,950
disseminate and send out alerts to our

351
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:07,279
users in the face of threats now we very

352
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,979
much work on awareness raising so that

353
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:13,279
people become aware of the dangers that

354
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:16,009
we they may be facing the number of

355
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,419
practice measures such as inspections

356
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:22,700
oddities so that systems are well

357
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:25,039
tragedies monitoring we are monitoring

358
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:29,739
all the time the traffic that goes

359
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:36,739
through our network we pen test this is

360
00:20:29,739 --> 00:20:40,190
this help us strengthen the access

361
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:43,970
controls and then the monitoring and

362
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:47,440
then reactive measures we restore system

363
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:53,029
we manage incidents we do forensic

364
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:56,570
analysis we look for attribution and if

365
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:59,869
through attribution traceability we

366
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:02,539
managed to identify the person who has

367
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:05,779
committed the crime we promote we

368
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:10,179
implement legal actions now defense

369
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:16,369
capacity this is infographics will have

370
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:20,330
sister administrator the administrator

371
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:25,099
the operating Authority what we do from

372
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:27,439
the joint command we monitor we monitor

373
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:30,379
all the elements of this flowchart

374
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,299
whenever we detect illegal activity we

375
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:34,639
manage the incidents we provide

376
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:37,460
technical support will have immediate

377
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:40,428
response teams because our networks are

378
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,980
not only deployed in national

379
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:50,679
territory but also international

380
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:53,450
territory we have our personnel were

381
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,210
distributed all over the world will have

382
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,820
clients all over the world and as I say

383
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:04,249
whenever there is an incident we provide

384
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:09,049
immediate response and then we also have

385
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:12,529
a Ford and 16 forensic team that helped

386
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:14,869
us work not only with malware but with

387
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:18,559
the actual activity with the actual

388
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:20,959
incidence exploitation capacities I went

389
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,629
through them quickly before but at the

390
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,480
end of the day but we really need to be

391
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:28,668
aware of it in terms of the potential

392
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,340
attackers we really need to know how

393
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:34,070
they are organized and here we are

394
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,399
talking about nations we are talking

395
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:42,230
about the army the Armed Forces of other

396
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:45,289
countries devoting time and resources to

397
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,240
organize these criminal activities we

398
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:49,610
really want to find out about that

399
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,759
tactus the techniques they proceeded and

400
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,769
we are all the time looking into it all

401
00:22:52,759 --> 00:23:01,249
the time monitoring that we try to

402
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:05,059
identify possible attacks potential

403
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:07,999
threats potential attacks to trigger

404
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:10,460
that early alarm that I mentioned before

405
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:13,490
we'll have those capacities and then

406
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:16,070
well old r can be used for for us to

407
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:19,059
implement offensive actions if needed

408
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:21,889
response capacity offensive capacity

409
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:26,830
it's one of the three pillars that we

410
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:31,809
have and what is this response about

411
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:35,779
well actions against adversaries that

412
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:38,570
have an impact on the integrity or

413
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:42,230
availability of the information system

414
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:46,178
and telecommunication system the

415
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:49,549
emphasis has a commander control system

416
00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:52,669
so all organizations have a commander

417
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,760
control chain hours same as that of

418
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:56,460
other

419
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,460
is strongly supported on information

420
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:03,870
technology if the command and control

421
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:07,250
chain of the emphasis cannot use the ITC

422
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:10,979
it is like if we were blocking our

423
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:14,430
nervous system no matter how strong our

424
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:18,960
muscles are if we we meet we need

425
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:21,630
nervous system so this is one of the

426
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:26,310
objectives of the emphasis of any

427
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:30,480
country whenever they go into an Android

428
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:34,100
conflicts Cabana control system is made

429
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,980
melon ball void and now we can do that

430
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:40,409
more easily than in the past so we've

431
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,270
seen that we've seen capabilities and

432
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:47,580
now let us move on to military

433
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:53,490
operations in the cyberspace so

434
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:56,730
definition here we unfroze is like very

435
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,710
much to go through definitions I

436
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:02,690
understand that they may be a bit boring

437
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:06,750
but it is good so that we all end up

438
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:08,940
sharing a language military operation in

439
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:12,360
the cyberspace we don't refer to it as

440
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,940
cyber operation I don't like to use the

441
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:19,080
prefix cyber all the time cyber security

442
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:23,970
cyber operation because sometimes these

443
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:26,580
may make it be less serious I prefer to

444
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:30,030
talk about military operation in the

445
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:33,949
cyber space well even if you read cyber

446
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:37,350
whatever in my presentation I prefer or

447
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:40,500
military operation so this is an

448
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:43,909
operation same as any other that uses

449
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:47,760
cyber capacity to achieve military

450
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:52,860
objective whether it's x placing the

451
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,240
cyberspace or through it I may achieve a

452
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,870
military objective in the Civil

453
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,300
cyberspace Oh through the cyberspace and

454
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:03,179
now aren't attacked in the cyber space

455
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,159
this is essential it is essential

456
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,049
because understanding but an armed

457
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,809
attack is

458
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:12,929
at us understand self-defense according

459
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:15,539
to international law where I can self

460
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:20,159
defend myself as an estate and what I

461
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:24,529
cannot do it as a matta is an attack

462
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:28,529
that causes advantage causes damage

463
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:32,340
physical damage on individuals and in

464
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:34,619
objects that's a real world and what

465
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,299
happens being the virtual world exactly

466
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:39,149
the same for me you consider the

467
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:41,908
nanotech this and I'm detect I need to

468
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:45,619
have damage on people and objects

469
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:48,210
sometimes papers we read has been

470
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:49,918
attacked in the cyberspace this is one

471
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:53,159
more component of the cyber world this

472
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,859
is Seth exactly no let us find what are

473
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:58,519
the light latest attacks in the

474
00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:02,779
cyberspace that have caused the physical

475
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:06,720
damage well only feel only fear of them

476
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:09,480
than that so this is like the third

477
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,789
world world that is taking place in this

478
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:17,749
cyberspace but is still how much damage

479
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:20,789
has been caused let us go beyond that

480
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:23,039
terrorist actions I'm not talking about

481
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,679
aunt attacks aunt attacks are carried

482
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,080
out by estates but terrorist actions

483
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,899
have they taking advantage of the server

484
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,850
space to cause physical damage on people

485
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:35,699
yes they have done that but that is not

486
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:38,129
cyber world well i would say were in the

487
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:42,559
cyber space that is terrorism taking

488
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:46,199
advantage of the saturday space and now

489
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,210
effects effects in cyberspace we are

490
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,309
sources like to talk all the time about

491
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:56,369
the effects the impact that will be

492
00:27:50,309 --> 00:28:04,039
having oh so well this could be a bit

493
00:27:56,369 --> 00:28:07,109
redundant effects affecting how

494
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:09,450
information system confidentiality and

495
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:12,720
integrity availability of information is

496
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:14,639
affected we have had that before we have

497
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,100
to protect our information so that it is

498
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:19,740
not infiltrated so that it is not

499
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:23,820
tampered with so that it stays in

500
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:26,450
place so that it is not tampered with

501
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:29,010
and so that that it ends up generating

502
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,050
mistrusted novel activities or we cannot

503
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:34,070
work with it anymore and we also have to

504
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:38,550
safeguard the availability of our

505
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:41,129
information this is what we always do to

506
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:43,980
protect these three elements and now

507
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:47,250
military operations we are working on

508
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:52,520
that which is the structure every time

509
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:55,980
we carry out a military action on our

510
00:28:52,520 --> 00:29:00,420
CNC system is made up of the following

511
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:03,150
elements operation command it is a joint

512
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:08,750
command including personnel from the

513
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:14,520
three armies and then it has a component

514
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:16,350
command Oh lands then C so remember that

515
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,559
in the beginning we talked about the

516
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:23,850
space we just don't have capacity as

517
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:26,460
armed forces to act on the outer space

518
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,100
but we just have special operations

519
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:32,610
command and then we also have the

520
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,370
component command in the southern space

521
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:38,580
and that's as we are the joint command

522
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,500
of cyberspace area of operation will do

523
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,320
we work we work in the cyber escapades

524
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:46,350
of course but we do not work in the

525
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,939
whole cyberspace our system networks and

526
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:54,240
systems ITC system from the Ministry of

527
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:58,230
Defence in the national territory we

528
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:02,970
work to defend our operations abroad as

529
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:04,770
well so whether it is these missions on

530
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:09,090
other type of a munitions where we are

531
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:12,570
present abroad and also other tasks that

532
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:15,510
we may be granted and then we also have

533
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:18,240
a variable area now at this point are we

534
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:24,540
in and involved in an armed conflicts no

535
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:27,300
we are not no nation is free from being

536
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:29,280
a boxing into an armed conflicts of

537
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,879
course unless you have to be ready for

538
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:37,200
that only known this surface to be it

539
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,090
defend is really really large because

540
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,300
there are more and more elements

541
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:51,169
connected to the Internet we have

542
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:55,980
smaller and smaller devices however with

543
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:59,640
capacities that can end up causing lots

544
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:02,490
of harm on States this is one of the big

545
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:06,110
problems or huge problems that we are

546
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:12,150
facing how to defend these larger

547
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:14,280
surface how can I defend myself against

548
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:20,700
the nuclear threat it is virtually

549
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:27,180
impossible nuclear defense some

550
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:29,400
countries decided to arm themselves just

551
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:33,410
to be sufficiently arms and just in case

552
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:37,410
you were attacked cyberspace may develop

553
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:40,860
may progress in that direction if you've

554
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:42,510
been a network administrator before you

555
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:49,139
know that sometimes you don't have

556
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:52,020
enough resources to to defense Network

557
00:31:49,140 --> 00:32:00,060
hundred percent everything that I've

558
00:31:52,020 --> 00:32:03,300
received by email is it safe when we how

559
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:06,960
do you manage how do you make your users

560
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:10,530
know to say yes Oh to accept everything

561
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,870
um this is very difficult to do are you

562
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:15,810
known that you cannot defend yourself

563
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:18,419
fully however however you have offensive

564
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:21,000
capacities offensive capacities and

565
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:23,430
therefore this is a deterrent to go and

566
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:30,410
say okay you are strong but I am also

567
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:33,840
strong bond a Vista militar Oh like that

568
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:37,020
how cyberspace activity can go down for

569
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,580
the military yield how do we plan

570
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,710
operation same as with any other

571
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,260
dimension we don't have a different plan

572
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,450
and strategy for that dimension is just

573
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,390
the same and we integrated with all

574
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,920
other operate

575
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:52,360
it doesn't make much much sense so but

576
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,880
it could be that we could have

577
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,709
operations with just one cyber component

578
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,360
no it's not like that it's just another

579
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,000
component but it is always a joint

580
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,070
operation there is a land component and

581
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,500
it's all synchronized from the bottom

582
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,760
level that it's tactic all the way up to

583
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:12,070
the strategic error level and there are

584
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,830
two sub processes within the planning

585
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:19,540
process first one would be cyber

586
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:22,929
targeting and what do we do there so you

587
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:25,330
need to consider is it really an

588
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,650
operation as part of our armed conflict

589
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,649
so it is offensive if there's something

590
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:33,880
we do on a daily basis cyber targeting

591
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:37,410
then means that we identify targets that

592
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:40,840
are to be offensively attacked we

593
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:43,390
prioritize them and assign I effects

594
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,280
that are to be achieved and then we've

595
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:49,690
got another subprocess digging in that

596
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:52,870
it's a cyber weapon in whippany reen and

597
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:55,750
is we decide what we are going to do

598
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:57,790
what method to follow and maybe we

599
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,490
replicate the target in our virtual

600
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,110
environment but cyber weapons we know

601
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:04,630
the effects don't cause if it's

602
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:08,168
excessive effect if it's controllable

603
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:11,050
effect and if it fits into what its

604
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:13,658
desired as as an outcome and it is

605
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:16,960
closest to the real world because we can

606
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:19,510
replicate systems on which we can act

607
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,360
efficiently and sometimes in the real

608
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:25,720
world this is not possible kinds of

609
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,960
operations I'm well aware that I've been

610
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:30,939
talking for some time now and so lots of

611
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,270
a military camp ends I'm not sure

612
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:37,330
whether you will be able to digest all

613
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:42,880
the remaining crimson slides for the

614
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:45,219
conference let's discuss briefly and so

615
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,350
that it is not too boring what kind of

616
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:50,009
operations aren't there that have to do

617
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:55,259
with a capabilities we have defensive

618
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:58,480
aberrations to keep our maneuver and so

619
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,370
we can still work inside information

620
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,890
systems that's the target unless we

621
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:05,710
said it's protecting his monitoring is a

622
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:08,589
month is responding I will not dwell on

623
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:11,500
that but it will dwell on the types well

624
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:15,160
actually I've already explained that our

625
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,470
networks and our work in networks all

626
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,680
protecting a specific system against are

627
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:23,649
given threat it could happen our air

628
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,109
force system can be attacked by a given

629
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:30,100
threat and so we focus on that very

630
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:31,720
specific skillset supply station

631
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,690
operations that have to do with our

632
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,870
capability to exploit activities also

633
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:40,630
information on our adversaries at times

634
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:42,339
of peace and I'm conflicted as well we

635
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,370
always keep we keep getting information

636
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:48,510
on the source of attacks so we were

637
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:52,750
gonna and there are different kinds and

638
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:55,260
um for those who have a more technical

639
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:59,370
proof on eat mine ring a bell its

640
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:03,160
intelligence open source intelligence Oh

641
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:06,130
sent that's the name and we recover

642
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,920
what's out there in in the outer space

643
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:12,700
or elsewhere we get information that we

644
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,160
get from dear system we have google

645
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:17,879
hacking as well we get information out

646
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,799
of websites we work with file metadata

647
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,490
we get interesting things out of all

648
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,340
that so far nothing out of the legality

649
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:29,410
then there's nothing preventing people

650
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,290
from doing this but we also have passive

651
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:35,620
recognition we list devices we see which

652
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:39,790
are devices that are active we can even

653
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:42,430
even we have the skills to have port

654
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:45,970
scan and see what ports are active

655
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:49,690
closed disabled protocol's running on

656
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:52,359
those ports services running on those as

657
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:54,100
well we do have the capability doesn't

658
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,200
mean we are doing it but we have the

659
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,990
capability and when necessary it will be

660
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,060
done we identified operating systems we

661
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,339
analyzed vulnerabilities in it we are in

662
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,380
a position to cut the information so

663
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:07,030
since we've gathered information we will

664
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,340
be able to use it when needed

665
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:14,830
then there's a third side to it that

666
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:16,360
it's advanced persistent threat this is

667
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,670
something that cannot be done at times

668
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:22,620
of peace and that it's penetrating

669
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:28,300
systems of the adversary's and ex future

670
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:31,890
information constantly then offensive

671
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:36,610
operations I will not dwell on that

672
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:38,440
degrading interruption destroying its

673
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:43,240
always synchronized with all other

674
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:46,180
dimensions by the way and often we need

675
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,029
previous exploitation operations to have

676
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,799
offensive operations later on our

677
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,450
operations we control them we've got

678
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,830
different control levels there's these

679
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:59,859
control authority for cyberspace like el

680
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:03,370
Teresa which is the one authorizing

681
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:07,780
activities out in cyberspace the same

682
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:09,759
way we have one control unit for Air

683
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,520
Force activities we've got one for

684
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:17,200
cyberspace we've got at sia cnc for

685
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:20,590
driving this is seafood d and then we

686
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,660
have some mission command where we

687
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:28,450
commissioned unit to carry out

688
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:31,270
operations this being a bit dense i

689
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:35,620
guess but i guess it's interesting to

690
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:38,740
hear about it at some time and what

691
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:41,830
about the law is regular law applicable

692
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:44,529
to cyberspace the ordinary long system

693
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:48,670
that we have is it Oh does it work yes

694
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:53,020
no issues but it's not years as we see

695
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:55,690
it I mean armed forces and cyberspace

696
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:57,610
operations that's our approached and

697
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:00,400
international treaties are there

698
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:03,550
applicable to the cyberspace yes it's

699
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,000
not just as a Spanish mmm armed forces

700
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:09,430
but it is actually Winehouse's a cyber

701
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,440
strategy one has one of the main powers

702
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:14,109
and they understand that the

703
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,480
international legislation that it's

704
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:19,480
valid is used all over the world at

705
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,730
peace and at war at peace a time

706
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,830
appeasing up of war and there are no

707
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,619
specific treaty international treaty a

708
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:29,259
contrary to see where there is a

709
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:31,390
specific treaty for this dimension which

710
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,460
is international and applicable to all

711
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,650
nations is their specific treaty for

712
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,050
cyberspace no that's not the other task

713
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:40,780
forces were working on it yes United

714
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:43,119
Nations do all countries agree no

715
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,350
actually there are some divergences so

716
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,990
in the short term it will be difficult

717
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:49,450
to get specific treaties for cyberspace

718
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:52,299
still there are few documents there's

719
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:55,629
this mmm a few manuals helping us

720
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,180
interpret international legislation in

721
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:00,580
the field of armed conflicts this is

722
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:03,270
talents manual the Italian capital of

723
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:06,490
Estonia that's where the cyber defense

724
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:08,859
center for the NATO is and they have

725
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:11,470
this manual that interprets

726
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:16,569
international legislation for armed

727
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:19,480
conflicts then sovereign team snatching

728
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,700
nation states are sovereign and so while

729
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,830
their infrastructures then

730
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:25,660
infrastructures that have a cyber

731
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:27,549
component and everything happening about

732
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,960
them the state is suffering and

733
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,150
responsible is to be held accountable

734
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,480
and often there are structures in a

735
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,130
country that are used as a proxy to

736
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:42,150
conductivities less wear and thus where

737
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:44,650
the countries are a cantor used ad

738
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:48,310
bellum that's what we call justice

739
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:51,580
before war so at times of peace and what

740
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:55,180
rewards the legislation what the

741
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:57,480
national law for each country do we have

742
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:00,009
it in Spain yes specifically for

743
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,090
cyberspace actions yes they are part of

744
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:06,520
the criminal code and as a crime it tip

745
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:09,940
advised and unauthorized access to

746
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:13,030
systems this is a crime that has as

747
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:17,140
prison sentence or an authorized

748
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:19,690
interaction of a system so causing a

749
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:24,368
denial of service on a system and it is

750
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:26,740
used both on the source country but if I

751
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:29,380
episode such as I work here from Spain

752
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:32,830
and I use proxies in Germany Iceland or

753
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:34,330
Zambia and the final target is in a

754
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,920
different country I go through so many

755
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:41,830
countries for my criminal activity or my

756
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,260
activity outside the law and I I would

757
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:46,509
be started to all the last they are

758
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,580
starting country the intermediary

759
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:51,820
countries and the target country as well

760
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:53,319
and that's nationally speaking then

761
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,140
internationally is there an

762
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:59,109
international law for times of peace yes

763
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:03,629
the UN Charter that regulates the use of

764
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:06,190
force and the use of force is prohibited

765
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:09,850
specifically prohibited in times of

766
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:11,970
peace two exceptions that the Security

767
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:16,060
Council would authorize it to

768
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:19,660
re-establish a world peace or preserve

769
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:22,150
boo p a world peace this is one of these

770
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:25,390
the exceptions and then article 51 I

771
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:29,280
could use force a self-defense

772
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:33,279
self-defense in case of an armed attack

773
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:41,050
armed attack harm to be bull damages to

774
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:43,180
objects so can i I get an attack out in

775
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:48,070
fear in the cyberspace from a x-country

776
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:52,000
can I reply back is it considered an arm

777
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:54,550
to talk can I exercise my self-defense

778
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,950
right is there harm is a damaged

779
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:59,109
involved we need to look into that this

780
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,149
summer that needs to be assessed is it

781
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:05,310
fully identified or is just a suspicion

782
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:08,619
that I have so it ain't a scene

783
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:12,340
self-defense is not so easy to be

784
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:16,800
justified in the cyber space for armed

785
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:20,260
conflict just imbalance so during war

786
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,420
international humanitarian law is dis

787
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,790
here and there are some parameters

788
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,060
distinction such as civilians and

789
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:31,779
military people what I do the military

790
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:34,359
if it causes that damage or harm within

791
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,910
an armed conflict can not harm civilians

792
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:38,549
and the military we can upside there is

793
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:40,460
a military infrastructure which is a

794
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,070
factory and

795
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,890
that's a weapon production getting

796
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:49,550
supply from a power plant and I get a

797
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:53,060
cyber access because it's connected to

798
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:58,280
the Internet and I can turn it down do I

799
00:43:53,060 --> 00:44:02,089
turn it down I can just pluck it out do

800
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:05,150
i or we do I need to understand who else

801
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:08,450
is getting its supply from it maybe it's

802
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:11,930
the hospital and do I know whether there

803
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:14,270
is an energy back end at the hospital to

804
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:16,580
produce energy I might cause a blackout

805
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:19,190
that would last for two days and there

806
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,020
would be civilian sign because of it if

807
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:23,060
this is something that we really look

808
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,490
into him before starting an offensive

809
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:30,380
operation proportionality we said it

810
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:34,368
already only necessary damages for the

811
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:36,650
military edge or advantage and and

812
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:39,470
conflict right we are not armed conflict

813
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:41,300
now but it is all about preserving lives

814
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:44,480
in so far as possible I only have a few

815
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,790
minutes left I had with me a few real

816
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,240
operations I have only a few minutes

817
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:52,910
left right but we've all heard about it

818
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:57,919
and the idea is to see if I can I we can

819
00:44:52,910 --> 00:45:01,629
identify as a war act in cyberspace or

820
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:04,460
not let me rush through this Red October

821
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:07,040
offensive operation starting in 2007 we

822
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,810
think it is still active of target is

823
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,029
diplomatic agencies and governments all

824
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:14,960
over the world affects them information

825
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:17,320
exfiltration so the one starting this

826
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,869
information wants to get information out

827
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:24,410
illegally physical attack and is it a

828
00:45:20,869 --> 00:45:27,020
war act it is not is cyber espionage it

829
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:31,910
happens in times of peace and war all

830
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:34,580
the time estonia the attack back in two

831
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:37,330
thousand seven TD was offense mps target

832
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,330
bornstein

833
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,830
freeze the administration state

834
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:46,150
administration was shown it was a denial

835
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:48,940
of service and in turn it also meant

836
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:51,940
that the excellent center of the NATO

837
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:55,540
was created botnet earth through more

838
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:57,100
than 170 countries 170 countries we

839
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:01,029
cannot track it down we cannot have it

840
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:03,759
set traceability is it out active war is

841
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:07,330
it an armed attack with their casualties

842
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,750
and physical harm no damage this is

843
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:13,900
sabotage it cannot be understood as

844
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:18,280
cyber space war real operations buckshot

845
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:20,710
Yankee 2008 offensive operation steal a

846
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,750
wood gets our right is the defensive

847
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:25,180
part the target was the Defense

848
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,740
Department of the United Nations effects

849
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,750
the information exaggeration and then

850
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:31,990
the Joint Command foot cyber defense was

851
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:35,170
created in the US attack vector USB that

852
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:37,149
was infected and left over there at a

853
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:39,750
parking lot and they infected their

854
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:42,250
whole network of the Defense Department

855
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:45,400
it is it an attack on the Armed Forces

856
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:47,800
of the United uses state sorry or is it

857
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:51,730
cyber espionage it is cyber spy at

858
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:56,070
Georgia a CDM south and azalea and

859
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:59,080
offensive operation the target was a the

860
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,520
nation states administration was there

861
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,850
an armed conflict yes there was between

862
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:06,550
Georgia and Russia they are involved in

863
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:10,029
an armed country conflicts denial of

864
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:13,300
service traffic deviation servers but

865
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:16,240
net taken control over servers this is a

866
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:18,430
cyber attack I spawn of an armed

867
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,830
conflict before an offensive so they

868
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:25,120
were laying the ground before starting

869
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:28,630
defensive so this is war in the

870
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:31,299
cyberspace so cyber war and we've we've

871
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:34,780
seen different real cases so in this is

872
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:37,150
just one side whoa example one of them

873
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,730
only one of them was a cyber warm Iran

874
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:43,080
we all know about the nuclear program

875
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:45,730
they have an offensive operation and

876
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,009
malfunctioning that was a fact mount

877
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,650
functioning of the center

878
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:52,560
huge in the uranium-enrichment plant and

879
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:55,530
so their nuclear plant was delayed for

880
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:58,590
two years and it was a USB a chick that

881
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:01,170
was infected it was a Stuxnet it was it

882
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:03,930
online no it was an independent of line

883
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:06,300
network and yet they got there it is is

884
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:08,580
it at cyber town is it an armed attack

885
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:12,750
as part of Warner it's just cyber

886
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:15,420
sabotage and just like this with this is

887
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:17,940
lined I finished my presentation and we

888
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:20,580
only have little time I'm a friend for

889
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:31,430
question but but I'm open to any

890
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:31,430
questions you might have cheap

891
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:53,500
I'm afraid they're not using the

892
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:56,350
microphone or else it is off SI la

893
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:58,900
pregunta yes your question let me repeat

894
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:02,170
it for everyone in case of the cyber

895
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:05,680
security incident with a cross-national

896
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:08,080
component inside the organizations where

897
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,759
we armed forces work such as that NATO

898
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:15,009
is there any joint activity for full run

899
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,740
response what we do is share information

900
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:20,850
about the incident together with

901
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:25,419
national buddies an international bodies

902
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:27,250
such as native so that they learn about

903
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,940
the attack that is happening and they

904
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:33,100
can react and reorient their defenses to

905
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:35,560
stop it but what about the reaction

906
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:37,360
there are two options there is one way

907
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,100
that would be solving the problem and

908
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:44,440
restoring the service this is one and

909
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:48,040
that's national approach fully national

910
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:49,780
approach and they each respond each

911
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,910
country in mean if they have the

912
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:54,910
capabilities and if not they can ask for

913
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:58,960
help to the organization but not as an

914
00:49:54,910 --> 00:50:04,210
of offensive defensive a way of

915
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:08,980
responding if it would be we have an

916
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:12,580
attack an incident causing casualties in

917
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:14,770
a country on this cyberspace can we

918
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:17,319
invoke that class or article that

919
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,390
bowser's full collective defense as a

920
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,890
country yes but needs to be understood

921
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:27,310
as an armed attack with given effects

922
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:29,890
that would be home all damages so we

923
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:32,380
need to understand it as cyber space war

924
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:34,839
so that we can invoke that class for

925
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,540
collective defense but it has not

926
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:39,760
happened actually even stone Ian Estonia

927
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:42,610
when there was this attack there there

928
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,340
was not an attacker that was part of an

929
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,370
armed conflict so it was not an option

930
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:50,060
to invoke

931
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:52,940
said said a closet was just cyber

932
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:55,250
sabotage and we thought a proper

933
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:57,020
attribution and an accurate attribution

934
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:01,490
to any given country there is suspicion

935
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:02,960
who could be interested in the action

936
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:24,950
but there was no proper legal

937
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:26,420
attribution any more questions so let me

938
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,669
repeat the question once again because I

939
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:32,090
guess the microphone is not working is

940
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:36,020
it possible to spot the source of the

941
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:39,950
tag can we understand what it comes from

942
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:42,650
or do they go unpunished yes there are

943
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:46,370
attacks that work for which we can find

944
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:50,180
the geographical origin that saw the

945
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:54,230
person who threw it what the physical

946
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:58,549
person behind net but it ain't easy at

947
00:51:54,230 --> 00:52:00,790
all most of the incidents more most of

948
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:07,340
those problems just go unpunished

949
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:09,710
because first block of traceability this

950
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:13,970
is a technical item and we really need

951
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:15,620
to justify before a judge technical we

952
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:17,029
need to bring those technical data to

953
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:20,839
see this is all the traceability and

954
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:25,460
then attribution so it's been this and

955
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:27,650
the one a person is this the their ID

956
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:29,690
number is this and that's traceability

957
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:31,520
but when your technical and legal in

958
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,790
that way we get authorship who's been

959
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:38,690
the author the perpetrator rather sorry

960
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:43,520
and that way we can take actions against

961
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:46,250
an individual or else retaliation as an

962
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:51,259
estate against a different state so that

963
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:55,670
would be as state perpetrator or agent

964
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:57,710
but as you might know anonymity it's

965
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:02,140
quite a component it's very serious an

966
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:02,140
attribution it's not so common

967
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:10,790
good wait combine II war and cited

968
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:14,540
defense into a real operation yes of

969
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:17,060
course for sure for sure in dominoes

970
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:19,820
different electronica trabajo we work in

971
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:24,440
different dimensions evo works within

972
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:27,890
the electromagnetic range and we work on

973
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:30,740
the cyber range the grill space but as

974
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:32,839
part of the cyberspace do we take also

975
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:35,240
part of the electromagnetic as phase

976
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:37,570
spectrum yes communications amongst

977
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:41,060
different information systems might

978
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:45,110
travel through a Wi-Fi system or such

979
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:47,270
lines or a radio link in and it is all

980
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:49,790
electromagnetic and we do use it in the

981
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:52,970
cyber world to communicate our rooms and

982
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:54,920
to get our systems to communicate so any

983
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,319
military operation that has a cyber

984
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:59,480
component almost for sure they will it

985
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:02,660
will have some Eve all components plus a

986
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:06,620
few others are land and sea and air

987
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:09,799
force but what happened what matters

988
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:12,680
here is if there's an operation where

989
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:15,440
there is an action in in the cyber space

990
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,240
which is a military action the for sure

991
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,580
they will have or almost for sure there

992
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:24,339
will have an emo component any more

993
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:27,799
questions if there are no more questions

994
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:32,610
thank you very much for your attention I

995
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:37,939
hope I didn't bore you thank you

996
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,939
[Applause]
