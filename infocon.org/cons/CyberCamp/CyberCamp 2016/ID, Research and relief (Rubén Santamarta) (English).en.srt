00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:13,670
thank you everyone for being here and

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:16,350
the Sunday morning rainy day very breath

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:19,289
thank you very much and also I'd like to

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,420
say hello to those of you those who are

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,350
following us on the streaming video

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:29,220
streaming so well I could also I would

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,890
like to express my gratitude to the

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,339
organizers I come from here for Leon so

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,050
I very much like to be at home and today

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,290
we will be talking about research and

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,540
relief so I will be sharing with you

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,829
results results that have not been

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,260
published and will be published here for

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,140
the first time and I hope that you like

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,968
them interesting as well as helpful and

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,699
if some of the things that we will be

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:01,590
discussing today of use to you either on

19
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:07,408
the short term on the long term I will

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:11,760
be very happy for that well having

21
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:14,850
already introduced I am the security

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,549
consultant principal security consultant

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:22,619
I do reverse engineering and buried

24
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:24,900
industrial control system I just crush

25
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,240
everything that comes to the lab and

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,970
this is what I do the agenda phone is

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,649
the following you start my presentation

28
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:37,229
with an introduction then why to doing

29
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,720
research and then real cases and glass

30
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,929
double penis with a few conclusions if

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,759
you have any questions and then I will

32
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:50,280
be happy to take them in the question

33
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:55,740
and answer session research it is basic

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:58,200
for humanity human beings are curious by

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,509
nature well perhaps we are less and less

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,509
curious but anyway we should try to keep

37
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,240
up that curiosity at the end of the day

38
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,340
research is about looking for new

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,769
knowledge and that knowledge is what

40
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,770
drives society forward

41
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:20,760
knowledge help however life condition of

42
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:24,269
our lifestyle and protect the planet

43
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,719
where relief which is not a minor thing

44
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:32,340
so research is basic we should never

45
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:39,209
ever underestimate our go against their

46
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:41,819
research there are four fields where

47
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:46,470
research becomes special importance and

48
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:49,319
this it is very important to have

49
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:53,099
research at the level of the person of

50
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:59,488
the individual you a person feels

51
00:02:53,099 --> 00:03:02,488
fulfilled when he understands how the

52
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:05,400
environment around him works how he

53
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,379
interacts with things that are close to

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,109
him as well things that are far away

55
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,720
from him so when something is far away

56
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:15,299
from you and when you study that and

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,639
when you research into that you

58
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,810
understand the world better and that

59
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:24,569
makes you feel also better more at ease

60
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:27,090
with the economic crisis we haven't

61
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,488
started to understand how many things

62
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,590
worked and if we had done that research

63
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,169
before perhaps we wouldn't have gone

64
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,430
into so much trouble we could have fixed

65
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:40,949
some problems before the crisis came out

66
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,530
so it is just essential to do that in

67
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:48,030
the personal level but also at the

68
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:51,569
business level so you cannot zoom as

69
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:56,639
Einstein said how approving it is said

70
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:58,589
that he didn't say it but anyway he said

71
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,169
what you cannot do the same thing all

72
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,389
over again so it's a question of risking

73
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:06,449
it and when you do the same thing always

74
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:09,419
you will never make any progress so I've

75
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:12,090
business research is extremely important

76
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:16,650
I will tell you more about what we do in

77
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:21,680
the company where I work so what is the

78
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:24,750
impact of research on security

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,180
and i will tell you also about the

80
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,820
things that are not in your favor when

81
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,060
you do research social research is also

82
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,740
very very important we talked about

83
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:39,600
improving life condition improving

84
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:42,360
humanity all of you are aware of the

85
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,270
concept return on investments however

86
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,810
perhaps not all of you I wear on the

87
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,820
social return of research there are

88
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,990
applied methodologies for that are there

89
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:58,950
and it is a way of measuring quantifying

90
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:03,120
how we research a project company has

91
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:07,140
had a social impact social impacting the

92
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:11,010
magnitude that is not always related to

93
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:14,610
money or to market so therefore I also

94
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:17,210
would like to see research associate

95
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,720
research that helped to improve our

96
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:26,159
lives and global research global

97
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,800
research and what you do at home will

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,340
have a higher greater impact at a global

99
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:39,680
level so all these dimensions all these

100
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,679
fields they feed back each other and

101
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:48,270
make up research so the field of

102
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:50,040
research as a whole so now let me tell

103
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,590
you about it resets that I carried out

104
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:57,030
two years ago more than two years ago

105
00:05:52,590 --> 00:06:00,000
and it was a research about security or

106
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:05,369
the lack of security in satellite

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,640
communication I found a number of

108
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:14,210
vulnerabilities in the systems that are

109
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:16,710
used to access systems use by satellite

110
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,830
they could kind of we could run a

111
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,169
parallel two routers so instead of

112
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,570
having an earth connection here we are

113
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:28,050
talking about satellite connection so

114
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:32,099
these systems are used in very many

115
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:34,320
scenarios were accessing and at the

116
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,479
connection is difficulty I'm referring

117
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,710
to

118
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:43,770
vessels aircraft remote connection of

119
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,930
course the military uses it so we are

120
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,729
talking about questions questions that

121
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,319
are satellite communications are

122
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:55,080
critical also vulnerabilities were found

123
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:58,800
in these systems these systems providing

124
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,650
connectivity to aircraft we had a great

125
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:07,860
impact it was widely discussed and say

126
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:13,049
well all aircraft will crash so I said

127
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,940
that and then then all that started to

128
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,509
to be said with of course which was far

129
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,360
from reality and then what conclusions

130
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:26,460
what conclusions can we draw from this

131
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,800
data set well some Park conclusions for

132
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,590
instance pool bad interpretations

133
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,720
princess as I said before you can say

134
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:41,429
the reserve vulnerability in in flight

135
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,919
system and then you try to explain that

136
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,470
and then that becomes blah blah blah and

137
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,109
then becomes make said a headline that

138
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,330
says okay well aircraft will crushed and

139
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,840
I said when I actually I didn't say it

140
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,789
of course but we should not forget how

141
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,099
what happens with media so what I mean

142
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:02,120
is that you should try to make a good

143
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:06,719
explanation of what you say so that that

144
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:10,349
headlines are no longer there in terms

145
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:17,639
of rumors rumors later on after

146
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:23,509
publication of that research when these

147
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:27,030
results were published somewhere else

148
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:30,090
they said that someone had hired are you

149
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:33,270
active to carry out his research and it

150
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:36,809
was intended to be a commercial attack

151
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:39,569
to the manufacturers of SATCOM and we're

152
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:43,828
going to mention out any names but that

153
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:46,800
was absolutely senseless because all the

154
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:48,839
company's manufacturing circumstances

155
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,930
were impacted but it

156
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,210
actually I explained the methodology

157
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,390
what I did in the recess how I

158
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:01,110
discovered all the fem were it was

159
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:03,930
available in a website I also explained

160
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,690
how I carried out the analysis or the

161
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:09,839
technical tests that I did and this is

162
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,940
what I'm trying to say here even if you

163
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,910
do everything right in the right manner

164
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:18,410
in this sector and probably same as in

165
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:24,329
very many other sectors well a number of

166
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:29,930
false theories come out and then

167
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:33,510
conspiration some people were obsessed

168
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:36,329
with the Malaysian airline and the craft

169
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:40,740
aircraft that disappeared leaving no

170
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,870
trace vanished and then they used to get

171
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,860
emails and I said surely you know

172
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,530
something because you've been

173
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,630
researching that I have this theory and

174
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:52,260
I said leave me alone I know nothing

175
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:55,770
about the aircraft of Malaysia Airlines

176
00:09:52,260 --> 00:10:02,490
so well there are all sorts up there and

177
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:06,780
then also enemies as I said before when

178
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:08,610
you publish that research well we didn't

179
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,189
publish the research of made the

180
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,440
research against anything or anyone we

181
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,860
just analyzed an environment that device

182
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:21,570
and we just publish the results and of

183
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,630
course you cannot keep everyone happy it

184
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,910
is understandable companies fortunately

185
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:30,150
not all companies when we publish

186
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:33,030
research most of the companies want to

187
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,550
cooperate with us they want to have a

188
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:37,890
better understanding of the problems

189
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,800
that we have found they also want to

190
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:44,730
learn and understand how what they can

191
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,979
do to help us resolve it but

192
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:50,120
unfortunately this is not always the

193
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:55,070
case and some companies take it as

194
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:57,780
either business or individual attack

195
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,570
lands at the end of the day well we are

196
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,339
talking about companies that may have

197
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:05,910
decision-making power in some field

198
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:09,689
however there is also a good side to all

199
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:12,240
that starting off with learning I knew

200
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:16,889
nothing about the topic the art research

201
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:20,300
made me study a loss and on that field

202
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:25,170
and I learned a lot things that I used

203
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:28,019
later on so this is what you take with

204
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:31,378
you but you keep with you you will never

205
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:35,269
finish that really research knowing less

206
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:38,819
than you knew when you started also

207
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:40,980
awareness raising and increase the one

208
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:44,399
is raising half the research or

209
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:47,370
publishing that we set some people may

210
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:51,180
become more aware of what is happening

211
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:55,519
there therefore as I say that increased

212
00:11:51,180 --> 00:12:01,138
awareness also leave two scenarios or to

213
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:03,569
taking security more into considerations

214
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:08,129
and companies may start to set up the

215
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:17,149
security teams as a result of these

216
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:19,829
research results also another advantage

217
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:22,679
when you publish a research of these

218
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:25,829
kinds a world of possibilities opens up

219
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,929
to you from the business world because

220
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:31,949
you will gain access to more resources

221
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:34,709
to more projects people are conferences

222
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:36,389
as chasm why do we do research I'd you

223
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:38,518
pay to do that are you hired by

224
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:41,309
companies to do your research note

225
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,550
that's not the way it is I or active

226
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:48,959
it's a company whose mission is research

227
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:52,949
and we do research for two reasons first

228
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,248
of all because it fosters learning it

229
00:12:52,949 --> 00:13:02,008
fosters learning it also helps

230
00:12:56,249 --> 00:13:06,420
researchers being fulfilled and also it

231
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:11,009
opens up gives you access to continue to

232
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:14,160
do more research with this I mean that

233
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:15,900
we do gain access to clients that

234
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,339
otherwise it would be very

235
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:24,860
difficult to get access to we have

236
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:31,050
produced state-of-the-art research on

237
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:36,180
pacemakers ATMs satcoms we are

238
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:39,060
researching other topics also relating

239
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:43,380
to industrial control so it is very

240
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:46,619
important to open up new options and to

241
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:50,880
create new research scenarios and now

242
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:54,150
talking about methodology so we are not

243
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,360
going to reinvent the wheel here and as

244
00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:00,510
I said before in terms of learning I

245
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,450
learned a lot it has been very important

246
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:07,920
for me very fruitful for me to carry out

247
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:10,980
research that was far away from what I

248
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,670
knew therefore I was not in my comfort

249
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:18,000
zone I didn't feel happy in approaching

250
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:21,030
all that of course I had a set of

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,450
knowledge however there was a long way

252
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:29,459
ahead of me a long way of knowledge and

253
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:31,740
learning I had to study a lot the first

254
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,200
phases of their visits I said to myself

255
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:38,910
I don't know what I'm doing here I'm

256
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:41,250
stunning a lot I am getting nowhere but

257
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:45,680
curiously enough and this is always the

258
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:50,220
case after a few weeks of studying

259
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,770
deeply then thanks there is kind of a

260
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:58,950
click in your brain and everything

261
00:14:52,770 --> 00:15:01,590
starts to to be more consistent and then

262
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,630
in the end you realize that things fall

263
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:09,030
into place that you are making progress

264
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:11,640
and that what you are doing is actually

265
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:14,939
meaningful and then with regard to

266
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,830
methodology well we just implemented a

267
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:20,130
scientific method there is no other way

268
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:23,160
but to implement scientific method and

269
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:25,620
more especially show in cybersecurity

270
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,230
you cannot go and say well this may be

271
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,140
sequel injection well now it is or it is

272
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,290
not so this is

273
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:37,340
methodology we apply to cyber security

274
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:39,699
and this is just about this is just a

275
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,820
scientific method first of all you

276
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,830
approach a problem you find a problem

277
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,200
you may find the problem or you may have

278
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:51,410
the intuition you may feel that the visa

279
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,210
problem there or somewhere or you may

280
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,939
find a problem for instance one day you

281
00:15:53,210 --> 00:16:00,320
are browsing and then your browser

282
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:04,760
crashes and then you look into why may

283
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:07,330
have crushed and you may have found that

284
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:11,720
you visited a website and the website

285
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:14,570
created that failure or perhaps to hire

286
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,000
a Trojan installed and then that

287
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:20,000
trillion didn't work well or was not

288
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,800
compatible with any of the features of

289
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,780
functionalities that you visited you

290
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,839
take it from there and then there could

291
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,720
be you could be facing different options

292
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:32,600
so that is first and second stage that

293
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,090
is to say he hypothesized creation and

294
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:39,080
then you have to go into the actual

295
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:42,320
research to look into why that happens

296
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:45,920
then you just have to a debugger just

297
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,330
that soon look into why it is crashing

298
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,849
why it's not working well to carry out

299
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,950
forensics analysis week I just

300
00:16:52,850 --> 00:17:00,370
implements wounded techniques that we

301
00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:02,780
all use that real now in security then

302
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:06,890
when you find something you should

303
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:10,399
wonder whether it is feasible well

304
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:14,150
perhaps it was just a breach it was just

305
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,820
something that it's not pointing at an

306
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,530
actual problem a severe problem if it

307
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,439
happens not to be a problem

308
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:24,109
unfortunately you cannot have any

309
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,500
tangible results any meaningful results

310
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:30,590
to publish but surely surely in the way

311
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,230
you would learn do learn and then you

312
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:37,040
take that away with you you will never

313
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:40,190
do never waste your time and then if you

314
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,310
have discovered something you will

315
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,760
publish it either in your blog or at the

316
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,460
comfort

317
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,730
and that will open up many doors to you

318
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,800
when it comes to finding a new job or

319
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,230
just well just to just do it for

320
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:57,200
yourself for your individual

321
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,810
satisfaction and then to set out the

322
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,870
basis for research the only thing you

323
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:06,050
can do I always advocated for reading

324
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:08,179
reading reading everything you will find

325
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,930
about your objective whether it is

326
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:15,160
published in books and papers videos

327
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:19,010
programs if you are doing research on

328
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:23,320
aircraft you watch documentaries videos

329
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:26,120
you name it we live in the time of

330
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:34,580
information era of information let us

331
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:39,709
use information for whatever is for some

332
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:42,740
terms of us being in studying cyber

333
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,390
security or IT security we know that we

334
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,190
will do research in a controlled

335
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,890
environment that is to say either at

336
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,530
home or you can set up your own lab

337
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,270
imagine that you have a friend who is a

338
00:18:51,530 --> 00:19:00,830
doctor okay says I'm doing besides at

339
00:18:53,270 --> 00:19:04,160
home and say oh my god gives the

340
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:07,010
difference as doing cybersecurity will

341
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,040
have that advantage we should tap into

342
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:13,790
it we just need a hardware software and

343
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:20,120
an objective and that is easy to get

344
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:22,460
nowadays and now let's talk about and

345
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,429
specific objective which is in flight

346
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:29,780
entertainment system I'm sure you've

347
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:34,610
seen similar pictures to dance on the

348
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:40,370
screen these are the typical displays as

349
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:43,310
you get on board you can read documents

350
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:46,610
you can listen and watch movies or

351
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:51,379
listen to music and now that it's time

352
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:54,070
to panic but not just because a craft

353
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,070
will crash

354
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:05,360
well I've been in the past I hadn't fear

355
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,660
of flying in the past and one of the

356
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,030
things that helped me overcome that fear

357
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:16,160
of flying was to understand why things

358
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:17,860
happen knowing why noise takes place he

359
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,260
for instance knowing or understanding

360
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:25,219
that no matter how much the aircraft

361
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:27,590
moves you that doesn't mean that you

362
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,050
will necessarily die that is to say to

363
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:33,290
give a context understand the context of

364
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:36,110
everything that is happening on board so

365
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,270
this is my tuchus about also that the

366
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:41,179
idea is to understand how in-flight

367
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,850
entertainment system works and not to

368
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,640
make any statements out of context and

369
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:49,939
of course not to create any panic and

370
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:57,620
panic with for no reason so just to give

371
00:20:49,940 --> 00:21:01,340
you some context on aircraft well we

372
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:03,500
have four different domains depending on

373
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,870
the data that reduced so let us say

374
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:11,240
there is a critical domain which is the

375
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,879
avionics domain which is the aircraft

376
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,880
control domain that's where we have all

377
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:20,030
the electronic systems controlling the

378
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,240
aircraft if something fails in these

379
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:25,460
domain the aircraft is very likely to

380
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,230
face a complicated situation that

381
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:32,480
doesn't mean that it will crash you will

382
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:35,360
fall off but the chance is there an

383
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,030
avionics there are five levels five

384
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,990
levels to certify the software that will

385
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:45,680
be run on an aircraft there are

386
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:48,620
different and levels of criticality so

387
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,250
level a highest level it means that if I

388
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,080
come one of those components fails the

389
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:58,070
aircraft is very likely to lose control

390
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,720
to drop off then we have level be level

391
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,240
B tell said that even if one of the

392
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,220
components in that domain well that may

393
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,679
cause some level of discomfort on

394
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,970
passengers but that would be that would

395
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,039
be

396
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,409
the consequence of it and often

397
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,440
in-flight entertainment systems are

398
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:18,010
below or to that domain that is to say

399
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:21,549
domain number b b domain be for instance

400
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:23,950
if one of them fails you may not be able

401
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:27,400
to watch a film and that would be that

402
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,620
would be the consequence of it however

403
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:33,130
there is a problem to that and this is

404
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:35,320
one of the things that i mentioned that

405
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,780
i talked about when i presented my

406
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:42,340
research on circum for instance to gain

407
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:48,520
access to the internet from in-flight

408
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:52,600
entertainment systems of do we use

409
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,250
SATCOM systems so if you pivot between

410
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,418
different systems that are connected

411
00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:00,490
between them so probably from a domain

412
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:03,580
which was not critical in the beginning

413
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:07,230
you may end up in a domain which is more

414
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,370
critical and this is a problem with

415
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,710
satellite devices because otherwise

416
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,620
devices are giving functions to critical

417
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,840
domains and two domains which are not

418
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:23,229
that critical for instance circum

419
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:26,770
systems provide communication to

420
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:33,039
avionics systems to control engines or

421
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:36,190
to send out messages between the captain

422
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:40,740
and the earth person LOL put personnel

423
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:45,190
and these are critical communications

424
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:47,650
also satellite communication system may

425
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,659
allow the communication to gain access

426
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,780
to the internet or to send out an email

427
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:55,299
to name it what happens that the same

428
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,340
device was offering both functionalities

429
00:23:55,299 --> 00:24:02,490
with this i mean that is someone manages

430
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:06,059
to compromise that device even

431
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:09,039
potentially you would potentially

432
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:13,330
compromise the communication of the

433
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:16,090
highest of the most critical domain on

434
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,370
the aircraft but let us leave that aside

435
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,830
and now let us focus on the basic

436
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,678
architecture of in-flight entertainment

437
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:26,678
systems this is not very complicated

438
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,679
well in the first place we have the seat

439
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:33,669
displayed units as we saw before this is

440
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:38,039
the display that is will have full back

441
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:41,169
of the seat and we also have the

442
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:47,769
personal control unit that's where you

443
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:51,309
can control lights Oh system controlled

444
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:52,960
units that control everything that is

445
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:56,200
happening on board for instance the

446
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,470
lights of the system and this is managed

447
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:04,419
by onboard personal then we also have

448
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:08,289
the personal control unit pcu which is a

449
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:09,669
server that also requires certification

450
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,769
and it should meet a number of

451
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:16,240
requirements but at the end of the day

452
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:23,590
it is a server which is connected to the

453
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:27,340
avionic bus probably to iron 429 and

454
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:29,350
this ever is a proxy in between the

455
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:33,519
in-flight entertainment system and the

456
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:38,439
avionics because if the server receives

457
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:41,789
data about the speed and the height and

458
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,350
the location the service and starts

459
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:46,809
information out to the in-flight

460
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:49,389
entertainment system and you as a

461
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:55,690
passenger for instance they tell you

462
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:58,269
where the location of the plane etc and

463
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,669
then we also have the personal control

464
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:04,299
unit which is kind of like a handset

465
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:09,460
lightly telephone some cases we can

466
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:16,090
swipe our credit card to access the

467
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:17,919
content and also it also has wildy was

468
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:21,010
hazara functionalities for instance

469
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:27,240
controlling the height of your seat etc

470
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:32,529
and this is a known as a el are you you

471
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,730
it can be easily and mounted and mounted

472
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:38,980
back again

473
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:43,870
so everything I started on flight from

474
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:49,520
VAR so do vie I was a bit bored and I

475
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:53,000
said to myself ok let us see if I can

476
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,930
control something and then I touched on

477
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,170
the left top kuna on the display and

478
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:03,170
when you touch through touched it 3 over

479
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:08,630
time to code a debugging information and

480
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:13,280
it was basically d IP the name of couple

481
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:15,710
of firmware files and that was it that's

482
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:21,490
about it Alison this is interesting I

483
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:26,480
kept it and when I landed on dubai I

484
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:28,400
looked it up on google and I wanted to

485
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,810
see what I what I could get from that

486
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:36,410
then I found all the firm were available

487
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:38,600
full of from very many airline companies

488
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:43,690
this was a website that was not

489
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:48,500
protected whatsoever you just have this

490
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:50,630
long directory and they were using this

491
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,540
website and actually they continue to

492
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:56,840
use it however now you cannot browse

493
00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:00,320
these directories and they were just

494
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:03,050
hosting all the upgrading their I

495
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,030
downloaded some of them not all of them

496
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:11,690
because there were too many and I

497
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:14,480
started to want to analyze it and all

498
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:18,080
these is manufactured by Panasonic

499
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,300
Panasonic avionics which is probably the

500
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,750
most widely used in flight entertainment

501
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:28,180
system it is used by united airlines

502
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:32,210
delta american airlines klm Lufthansa

503
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,740
Elena's Argentina's Iberia every edges

504
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:38,600
to use it i don't know whether they

505
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:41,720
continue to use it now or not most of

506
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:46,610
the main headlines did use this product

507
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:47,520
and based on my fam work analysis we can

508
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,159
conclude

509
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,340
we will have the server the server that

510
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,990
I mentioned before that requires

511
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,179
certification avionics certification I

512
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:00,840
tried out the number of functions there

513
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,970
and then we also have the seat up which

514
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,250
is the device that you have on the

515
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,060
passenger seat and then we have the crew

516
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:11,880
up which is the device managed by the

517
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:14,639
true with sit up sit up allows you to

518
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:18,750
interact through a USB or three handset

519
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,210
the handset that we mentioned before the

520
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,760
handset is used while amongst other to

521
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,770
swap your credit cards and then to gain

522
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,530
access to some services then

523
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:33,780
communication between the server and the

524
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:36,570
various units is done through the

525
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:39,540
internet through the ethernet and then

526
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:47,639
the server as I say he has access to the

527
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:51,030
avionics bus from there hi started to

528
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:55,670
analyze the files that I found well

529
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:58,200
there are several versions of the

530
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:03,480
in-flight entertainment system by

531
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:06,660
Panasonic the oldest ones both were

532
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:12,260
based on lenox then they switch to

533
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:15,260
Android and they use the number of

534
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,260
scripts

535
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:24,820
scripts that allow interaction with the

536
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:28,500
main binary they have binary a binary

537
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,500
implementing a number of functions

538
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:42,520
binary that receives packages about the

539
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:45,790
location of the aircraft to control the

540
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:50,350
card reader and these functionalities

541
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:59,409
are widespread through that script

542
00:30:50,350 --> 00:31:03,100
language so decided to reverse it to see

543
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:05,410
how it works this made up of hundreds of

544
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,870
commands some cases some of these

545
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:10,840
commands I incremented others and and

546
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:13,750
those commands allows you to do very

547
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,340
many things for instance modifying

548
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:20,860
whatever says on the screen launch nap

549
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,750
so every possible when all the

550
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:26,370
functionalities of the device can be

551
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,370
accessed to that script

552
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:39,629
if we analyze how define what's the

553
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:43,199
first instruction on the screen then we

554
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:46,289
look for cold and we see where this is

555
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,350
managed they do personally line by line

556
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:51,090
they parse the script and when they

557
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,969
detect and structure that they've

558
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,459
recognized the structure is passed and

559
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:59,070
then information is extracted in case of

560
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:04,340
define when they detected they jump to

561
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:06,779
another routine to check the parameters

562
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,779
following define there are several

563
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:13,350
defines for instance here in box to we

564
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:19,200
can see an item which is not draw time'

565
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:23,279
or value same as we saw in the previous

566
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:28,710
screen the screen on top line so if that

567
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:30,899
is a value that value is parsed to see

568
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:34,470
whether it is a constant or number

569
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:36,840
because several constants are supported

570
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,570
as well if it is a constant they

571
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,610
extended and if it is chrome create a

572
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,379
specific value they keep the name of the

573
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:45,748
value that is being defined as well as

574
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:50,850
the actual value and then they keep

575
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:54,149
their to use it later on when in during

576
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:57,080
the running of the script and then this

577
00:32:54,149 --> 00:33:01,860
is a command table some examples there

578
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:05,939
and this is the way we I analyzed the

579
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,769
system finale is pouria suppose comment

580
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,830
avoir de las tarjetas de Greedo para

581

582
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:16,350

airmail open am BR un SMS a ver easy

584
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:22,498
mailing or texting for all of that you

585
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:24,509
need to pee and the credit card needs to

586
00:33:22,499 --> 00:33:29,970
be swiped through the handset and that's

587
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:32,039
it sent and Brett by this system that

588
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,080
would be advised that is specifically

589
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:41,559
developed for that

590
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:46,449
and as you can see they are passing the

591
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:49,570
red car crux eventually if we could

592
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:53,080
maybe endanger compromise the system we

593
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:57,070
received your leak could get some credit

594
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:59,740
cards information that that not be would

595
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:02,799
not be the main target if you used it to

596
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,720
read PDF documents you might think that

597
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,379
it's similar to X PDF yes that's right

598
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:11,199
this is the script that starts X PDF is

599
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:16,830
started by X PDF to read PDF documents

600
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:16,830
from the USB unit as I was saying before

601
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:27,129
the system is a linux-based and they

602
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:31,450
just just it just uses a Linux tools and

603
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:34,418
some other open source tools based on

604
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:40,178
that license but well they shouldn't use

605
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:44,759
them anyway the latest version includes

606
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:52,168
a dried so the flow changes a bit and

607
00:34:44,760 --> 00:35:00,130
that's where they change from one script

608
00:34:52,168 --> 00:35:04,060
this one too qml so it's a bit more

609
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:07,119
clear it is scalable can be scaled up

610
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,250
and then it can be replicated bill down

611
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,280
with the previous scripts and this is

612
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:17,670
what swim used and we still have access

613
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:22,119
to the code for the new version and

614
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:25,270
there it is then the back end as I was

615
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:28,570
saying before this system has a

616
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:30,790
client-server architecture on the server

617
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:33,640
we have the backend running initially

618
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:36,700
the backend was not or not all the food

619
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,549
was available on the website but then by

620
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:43,569
looking for some words that I came up in

621
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:48,310
the code I found a different company

622
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:51,250
this one did have the backing exposed

623
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,200
it was back end for some airlines but in

624
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:56,230
the end the base code would be just the

625
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,419
same and I think there's a problem there

626
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:02,950
once again it's not normally makes no

627
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:06,720
sense van those companies that are dot

628
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:10,060
error that are all related to the

629
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:13,120
aircraft sector this it makes no sense

630
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,950
that information is being revealed

631
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:18,250
sensitive information has been revealed

632
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:21,460
when they are sensitive or specific

633
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:26,830
clients or customers as i was in the

634
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:29,800
bonnie i checked the code I looked into

635
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:33,970
it all and when it was back in my dreams

636
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:37,990
I said well let just let's try this do

637
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:43,350
you find anything fishing here in this

638
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:47,049
query anything weird in this query or

639
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:51,279
maybe there's something you think could

640
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:54,700
be different yes it's an SQL injection

641
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,910
and this is not the only one so let's

642
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:01,180
see some videos I updated with some

643
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:03,520
vulnerabilities proven some

644
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:07,330
vulnerabilities that are not much

645
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:10,180
nothing much but still they prove the

646
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:14,680
problems that are there it was not about

647
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:19,859
to make a mess out of it of course so

648
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:19,859
let's have a look first of all

649
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:39,200
so first one this is what I said before

650
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:43,759
for some specific actions we do need to

651
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:50,259
pay that's what you need to use swype

652
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:53,599
you swip your cart there's something

653
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,910
that does not happen there and that is

654
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,980
that there is no real time validation of

655
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:02,299
the credit card once you swipe it and so

656
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:05,089
usually it is satellite communication on

657
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:06,920
the airplane or maybe specific mobile

658
00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:12,828
links but to see wait too expensive so

659
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:16,160
they somehow take up or indie or the

660
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:19,760
eventual fraud from the point of view of

661
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,230
an attacker makes no sense to scam from

662
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,299
the airplane because it's tightly

663
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:27,079
controlled and they wouldn't will know

664
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:28,790
who it was quite fast but I said this

665
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:35,740
there's no real time validation of

666
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:37,819
credit cards so even based on the

667
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,750
validation algorithms that I've found

668
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:44,450
well you could bypass validations though

669
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:48,049
some others do have real-time validation

670
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:55,490
but I don't think it's well I think this

671
00:38:48,049 --> 00:39:03,170
will get better so first of all when you

672
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:06,919
create an email so instead of an a HT

673
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:13,000
sorry I embedded an HTML tag and source

674
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:13,000
was sorry about this so so awesome Oh

675
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:21,259
videos up so back back again to the

676
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:25,130
beginning so this first clip is the way

677
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:27,549
to bypass credit card validation no need

678
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:31,089
for a credit car here so they use or

679
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:31,089
simulate rather

680
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:39,599
a geek goat when do you swipe the card

681
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:42,869
that way they know they've done you've

682
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:49,019
done it we can simulate it as well we

683
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:52,829
press ctrl s and that's it we've

684
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:55,859
bypassed credit card validation and we

685
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:59,249
can write an emails and texts written

686
00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:06,058
SMS so if we are going to write an email

687
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:10,589
I embedded an HTML tag added and a path

688
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:13,619
a path that is usually known to see if

689
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:16,650
you're reading a file or not because

690
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,660
then you're dead random and it will not

691
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:23,969
come back it will be stuck in there so

692
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:27,569
this way you see its stack the handset

693
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:30,630
or rather the panelist is a stock

694
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:35,279
because it's within the random code and

695
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:37,529
so it's frozen and you cannot watch the

696
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:39,450
clip anymore so you need to do this at

697
00:40:37,529 --> 00:40:42,539
the end of your trip right otherwise you

698
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:48,299
don't start without any kind of videos

699
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:51,569
or films and as I said before we are now

700
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:55,559
going to try an SQL injection this is

701
00:40:51,569 --> 00:41:00,390
search for firms horror movies and there

702
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:02,549
you see there if they are all the top

703
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:06,058
down and this is just a regular SQL

704
00:41:02,549 --> 00:41:10,559
injection nothing fancy about it but we

705
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:16,499
are high in the sky that's all so from

706
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:20,579
top down to bata not so that you see it

707
00:41:16,499 --> 00:41:23,899
changes its all highly sophisticated

708
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:23,900
right is one hand

709
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:37,760
as you can see well not my thumb but you

710
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:40,190
see movies are organized button up now

711
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:47,120
and from there onwards we could simulate

712
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:50,540
other attacks and through gold analysis

713
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:53,120
and settings of files you see all the

714
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:56,590
paths all the passwords that are being

715
00:41:53,120 --> 00:42:02,560
used to have access to the database so

716
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:07,750
all in all you could have done or tried

717
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:13,160
things such as a drive in the airplane

718
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:17,060
so this was found in 2015 and we warned

719
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:21,350
panasonic their reaction well I give it

720
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:23,690
a secret not too bad initially but I

721
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:30,940
don't know what happened then was

722
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:36,170
something going on there so a year later

723
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:38,750
they have a bat bounty I don't know

724
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:42,530
sorry a bug bounty I don't know if it

725
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:47,810
made a difference and or not but I hope

726
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:50,870
it it's encouraged and increase ins in

727
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:52,490
our own is about security and it is true

728
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:56,600
that the latest systems that are

729
00:42:52,490 --> 00:43:01,700
android-based have their own app store

730
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:04,100
and so they have an API so that

731
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:06,980
developers can develop their own apps

732
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:12,200
and then those will be included into the

733
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:14,300
store so it is true it's always

734
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:20,000
advisable to check it all up so if you

735
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:23,210
wanna look into Panasonic avionics

736
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,790
systems it's nice to know that if you

737
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,790
find something you will be paid for it

738
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:34,079
that's when i'll thank you for your

739
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:36,209
attendance i hope you enjoy dude and if

740
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,089
there are questions and I can answer

741
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:42,928
i'll be happy to do it that's what I'm

742
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:59,910
here for so thank you all see you next

743
00:43:42,929 --> 00:44:08,279
time I don't know but I wonder there's a

744
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:15,509
question there cannot hear you from here

745
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:17,880
so so admin password and all the way to

746
00:44:15,509 --> 00:44:20,939
the database was that it you say that

747
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:25,679
cart tracks were stored on the device

748
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:28,739
itself right so maybe you could tap god

749
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:33,449
in all the tracks and have used them to

750
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:40,499
clone God's then well it's too much

751
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:44,459
saying from what I've seen yes if you

752
00:44:40,499 --> 00:44:46,769
have an SQL injection and seeing that

753
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:49,589
there is no signature verification there

754
00:44:46,769 --> 00:44:53,549
isn't no verification actually if you

755
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:57,058
managed to rise or else to get the

756
00:44:53,549 --> 00:44:59,989
output that you can control from an SQL

757
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:04,049
injection into a file up to the server

758
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:06,749
then you can compromise the server from

759
00:45:04,049 --> 00:45:11,059
there potentially you could also

760
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:16,259
compromised client but he has of course

761
00:45:11,059 --> 00:45:19,469
technically speaking we cannot rule it

762
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:25,650
out but it's what I said before I would

763
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:30,359
rather keep my distance and not to go

764
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:33,150
into that but potentially if you manage

765
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:37,380
to overwrite the main binary the one

766
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:40,140
controlling data getting data from the

767
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:41,660
card reader yes for sure you could get

768
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,109
those tracks

769
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:48,890
use it to clone cards but still this is

770
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:51,348
an attack that technically eats it is

771
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:57,848
doable but I don't know to what extent

772
00:45:51,349 --> 00:46:00,049
it's worth it since it is an airplane I

773
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:02,210
don't know the statistics how many

774
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:06,950
people use a credit card on a plane but

775
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:09,619
I guess it is it makes more sense to go

776
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:17,240
to an ATM and do the same but do new the

777
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:19,220
seal please first of all here I'm here

778
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:23,149
first of all congrats on your

779
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:25,569
presentation very interesting and so my

780
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:31,180
question is based on your research as

781
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:34,609
you said before satellite connection

782
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:39,589
aims at us at a main server that

783
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:43,069
controls avionics and the IE each system

784
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:47,328
isn't it too critical so that both are

785
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:51,710
connected on you think the satellite

786
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:54,529
device on board provides different

787
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:57,529
communications pathways some for

788
00:46:54,529 --> 00:46:59,960
security but I always fly out a Terry

789
00:46:57,529 --> 00:47:03,650
over all the others so if there is some

790
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:08,690
dams and some event where there can only

791
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:09,890
be one channel it will be the safety

792
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:12,230
related communication that takes

793
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:16,848
priority whether it's safety or security

794
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:19,730
both these types at take priority so if

795
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:23,510
you manage to fully disable these

796
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:25,339
communication device from from from

797
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,349
there it will not be possible to have

798
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:31,700
either one type of communication this is

799
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:36,109
a well-known problem I didn't mention it

800
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:38,149
here but when I discuss such lines in my

801
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:40,549
presentation you google it and you will

802
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:44,000
find that there are some statements from

803
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:47,319
airplane companies or airline saying if

804
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,319
you ask us

805
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:57,849
isolate on the physical plane those

806
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,250
satellite communication devices that

807
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:02,980
means that users will not have access to

808
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:06,310
the Internet this is this is complicated

809
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:08,470
so technically might not be the best

810
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:10,930
idea to have just one single

811
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:13,419
communication device providing services

812
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:15,549
to a non-critical domain and then at the

813
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:17,770
same time an unknown are critical

814
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,930
service for the idea is to understand

815
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:21,430
things and mitigate scenarios and so far

816
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:23,919
as possible but it is a good question

817
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:30,098
because it is a one none problem so far

818
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:34,930
thank you very much in it seemed that it

819
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:37,300
was a a x86 32 bits and well it's funny

820
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:43,690
not there because there are some

821
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:47,020
versions demos for computer and other

822
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:50,440
four seats actually the color detects

823
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:56,259
whether it's running on a development

824
00:48:50,440 --> 00:49:00,490
rock or seeds so often that's not

825
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:03,070
necessary because based on the

826
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:06,580
documentation they had it seemed they

827
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:09,250
sent Airlines just demo versions that

828
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:12,970
are ready to run on PC so that they

829
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:14,920
checked everything is rice so those are

830
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:20,049
the ones that I managed to download and

831
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:23,020
check but I actually did not need to

832
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:25,930
emulate because the code was quite quite

833
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:30,070
straightforward but they do have

834
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:33,399
versions that are busy and code

835
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:42,360
understands when it is being run in a

836
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:43,920
different setting if there

837
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,880
no further questions thank you very much

838
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,530
see you next time

839
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,530
[Applause]
