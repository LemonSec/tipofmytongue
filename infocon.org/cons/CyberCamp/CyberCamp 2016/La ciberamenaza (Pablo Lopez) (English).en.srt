1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,560
thank you how are you doing good monium

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:12,570
i said as i introduce me i'm pablo lopez

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:15,570
and the second compared of the second or

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,390
the deputy head of the script op center

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,890
i would like to thank in serum for their

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:26,369
kind invitation we will focus now on

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:28,529
cyber threats generally speaking the

8
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,720
information that we will be given is

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,910
what we said already information you can

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,780
find on the internet there will be

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:40,169
nothing new but what's new about it is

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,270
that it is the experience based we will

13
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,760
not share anything that is not on the

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,489
internet but you see that we are

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,430
suffering ourselves of wood I would say

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,339
cyber threats so let me introduce

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,100
ourselves we are the national crypto

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,789
Center we are part of the intelligence

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,600
system in Spain and we'll have some

20
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:06,119
functions and roles so there are royal

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,049
decrees and standards that means that we

22
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,580
are in charge of some items for example

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:20,810
everything having to do with ICT

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:25,170
security and since 2010 we are a

25
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:29,009
governmental see ERT assert according to

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,659
the security system regulating non

27
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,860
sensitive information in the public

28
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,350
sector how it has to be guarded treated

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,070
handled managed so it sets out the

30
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,539
series of requirements security

31
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,669
requirements so that the information

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,600
security is as high as possible the idea

33
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,790
is that if the administration the public

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,579
sector correctly handled our information

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,490
citizen will be much safer much more

36
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,408
secure because the interaction with the

37
00:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,860
administration will be much more

38
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,479
convenient will be appropriate these are

39
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,439
the challenges and the missions that we

40
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,660
have our main role is to provide

41
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,540
services we have this service Holland we

42
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,850
are here to serve the public sphere in

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,440
so much as we can that's the

44
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,000
summary of the whole presentation then

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,950
we work as a community because we've

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,770
realized that by fighting this thread

47
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,899
the only way to contract it is with a

48
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:28,460
response as a group as they as

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:31,910
individuals we cannot get anywhere the

50
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:35,510
song stand our efficiency or added

51
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,720
volume is always related to the way we

52
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:41,030
can exchange sensitive information on

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:45,020
cyber threats with other experts in our

54
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:50,240
sector or environment context here are

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:53,330
some figures 13-14 that of December it

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,430
will be our 10th edition of our meeting

57
00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:00,950
we've been working for so many years now

58
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:03,680
as incident management and as focusing

59
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,989
or targeting some specific resources

60
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:13,190
we've been working on it for 10 years

61
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:15,590
now and in 2010 there was a framework in

62
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,430
a nutshell so it's 10 years long

63
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,900
experience we've learned with an

64
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,700
understood what we are up against and

65
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,530
refined in this thread which is not a

66
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:30,739
simple task at all we try to get the

67
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,840
necessary resources to contract it you

68
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:35,840
just have some figures to understand

69
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,240
what we are and what we do and now

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,390
focusing on the presentation itself here

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,610
it is and we see that this is a new

72
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,950
paradigm in the world if we follow this

73
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,350
present flowchart or presentation this

74
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,959
is facts for this year and we see that

75
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:56,150
almost thirty percent world population

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:58,910
this case scenario so Western society

77
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,610
around fifty percent there that would be

78
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:06,799
the average needs or uses social media

79
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:09,140
meaning but we need it that the

80
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,270
paradigms change is not a means it's a

81
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,040
neat it's not in a secondary service but

82
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,770
we are dependent so dependence has

83
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,570
changed we also come to see that

84
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:21,500
technology depends on the internet as

85
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:24,710
well and it is quite quite clear wall

86
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,280
attacks now sings last year with samurai

87
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,280
attack

88
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:35,330
the IOT devices will be used in

89
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,520
interconnection more and more often so

90
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,020
technology means that they have to be

91
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,568
fully connected and connected to the

92
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,830
rest of the world so on the one hand we

93
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:48,259
see that people need to relate to each

94
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,659
other and we've seen that for quite a

95
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:52,130
lot man of the population and the same

96
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,949
happens with technology and then we have

97
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,509
that person the present itself we've

98
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,490
always thought that if I am on the

99
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:01,099
internet and I'm browsing since I'm a

100
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:08,150
regular person just looking for I don't

101
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:10,250
know my bank my knees so on significant

102
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,590
thing so I'm no target so that paradigms

103
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:15,949
change as well just been on the internet

104
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,469
means that we are a target if you're not

105
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:20,750
paying for something you are the product

106
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,270
it says the same as before who's gonna

107
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,389
love me does the same no one loves me I

108
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:29,240
cannot believe I am given this refrain

109
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,699
so this is more or less the same if I'm

110
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,289
on the internet just because of the fact

111
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,289
that I am on the internet it comes at a

112
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:38,830
cost it is my behavior my trends that's

113
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:42,289
handle that's manage it it has a value

114
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,948
Google Facebook whatsapp so it is not

115
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:50,300
the information itself but every since

116
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:53,030
setting up behavior patterns that has

117
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,479
its own weight and finally technologies

118
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:59,659
no matter how much we want technology to

119
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,639
be safe and secure and quality and

120
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,460
audits in the end there will always be

121
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,009
bags in technology the world was be some

122
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,130
witnesses in this case around one maybe

123
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:12,800
these statistics are not so accurate

124
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:16,069
because I guess that the increase in

125
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,639
2015 was because hacking team but then

126
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:21,650
revealed all these zero-day

127
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,050
vulnerabilities so that increased if not

128
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,330
exponentially but at least a lot the

129
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,280
vulnerabilities that we knew about there

130
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,859
are vulnerabilities that people know and

131
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,780
exploit which means that Indian the

132
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:37,250
internet is what we said a growing

133
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:39,059
culture for 14 up the thread for those

134
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,490
agents and why is that

135
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:46,169
because they wanna ex winter information

136
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:48,300
recruitment propaganda and damaging

137
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,520
state nation-states getting a privileged

138
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:55,950
knowledge making profit out of a

139
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:58,889
transaction cyber crime as a service so

140
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:01,289
on the one hand we have a society that

141
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,060
is depending on technologies and then on

142
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,639
the other hand that person that is on

143
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,500
the internet it has a value already and

144
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,600
technologies need to connect and

145
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:14,729
technologies that have volar abilities

146
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:17,100
so that summarizes the scheme the graph

147
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:20,580
it's a growing culture for people to use

148
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:26,330
it to make and cause damage to their own

149
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:28,080
profit whatever that is it affects

150
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,979
administration and public sector

151
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,250
becoming the target to this attack so

152
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,900
what worries us is because we work in

153
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,070
the public sector and we try to make

154
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,989
some that it's a secure as possible

155
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,210
because if the adversary is not secured

156
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,430
their citizen will not be either and

157
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,780
that sensitized in society and that's

158
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,700
what we're doing and we've been working

159
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:54,599
on it for long we've seen this threat

160
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:57,180
these attacks that do harm and the

161
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,820
target it's their public sector which

162
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,130
usually will be represented by the

163
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,990
states and why is that basically because

164
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:09,240
the state's up the only ones that can

165
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:12,810
afford it afford having people moline

166
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:16,280
resource resources in the end for these

167
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,280
attacks creating these infrastructures

168
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,190
producing this kind of software

169
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,789
developing their own tools keeping the

170
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:26,160
infrastructure etc so only if you can

171
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:31,680
afford it those organizations that have

172
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:35,250
plenty of resources in summary these are

173
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,310
the stats for this week and there you

174
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:42,929
see the number of incidents so 2016 so

175
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:45,810
far 19,000 more than 19,000 incidents

176
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:48,479
them managed and that's what we see and

177
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,540
let me tell you something when we say

178
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,710
over 19,000 incidents that it's a

179
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,290
thousand more than last year

180
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:58,320
does not mean that our worst quality

181
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,329
just the opposite we have more incidents

182
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,310
and out of a greater quality when I say

183
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,100
so is because the standards we follow

184
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,199
with our probes and idsa we filter we

185
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,080
controlled them we improve them we're

186
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,020
trying to reduce false positives so even

187
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,940
if we still learning and improving our

188
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,010
detection capability that is based on

189
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,880
our big data intelligence and the way we

190
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:25,470
handle all this information which is

191
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:29,040
sensitive we said still it grows so the

192
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:31,920
problem is there that's what these slide

193
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,560
is for to explain that the thread is

194
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,390
growing our that is 19,000 now and out

195
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:43,670
of those high and critical would be 600

196
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:46,470
and critical 43 critical a 43 mins

197
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:49,349
cyber-espionage so there is a state and

198
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,730
this proof evidence that there's been

199
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:55,740
info excellent exfiltration from our

200
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,620
bodies whatever these are that's what

201
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,500
we've seen but there may be things that

202
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:06,540
we do not realize of course but at least

203
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:10,370
we understand what we are up against so

204
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:14,040
cyber threats happen and targets our

205
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:18,170
organizations 10% others is that's what

206
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:21,420
we always say we have our early warning

207
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,310
systems and when we say tempers and

208
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:27,260
other systems we mean information we

209
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:30,329
exchange with other bodies so other

210
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,870
environment services and security bodies

211
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:35,670
etc so work alone is not possible

212
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,150
working alone is not possible especially

213
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:43,500
for cyber threats we need to change and

214
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:45,180
exchange information here we see so many

215
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,490
incidents happen but what's the

216
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:52,620
percentage that a week careful harmful

217
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,320
card is fifty-four percent intrusions

218
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,990
over thirty-five percent out of nineteen

219
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,040
thousand cases so we need to understand

220
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,040
that is not just a Spain

221
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:10,970
oh sorry this is not only spam but it's

222
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:14,140
also x filtering or other purposes so

223
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:17,300
what I who are the players who are the

224
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:21,110
agents we are not making the map

225
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,120
criminal organizations cybercrime is a

226
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,370
service is being implemented so promptly

227
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,130
and and fast and why is that because

228
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,830
they bring us have it benefits a heavy

229
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,450
profit so it makes they make profit so

230
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,120
it makes sense we will see that the

231
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,420
black market we can go on to toe and

232
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,700
other portals where you get anything you

233
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:44,089
want to just go up there identify

234
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:47,690
yourself babe with big guns wait coins

235
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:50,990
that can be 400 300 euro in exchange we

236
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:53,770
know that the rate changes and you can

237
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:57,400
find tools quite quite simple with a

238
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:02,360
very user-friendly dashboard that anyone

239
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:05,959
can use so easily for at attack or for

240
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,660
crashing any server and then states is

241
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:12,260
what consent as the mouse because what's

242
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,880
that's what the ones that can play the

243
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,540
ones that have the resources at another

244
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,610
high level to compete cyber threats how

245
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:24,310
do they work they have a life cycle

246
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:28,420
let's focus on what cyber threats needs

247
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:31,189
need to to attack any kind of system

248
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:34,699
they need infrastructure they need some

249
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:37,520
tools then need an infection vector I'll

250
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,740
insist on Vance because you have tools

251
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,620
infrastructures Mallory but if you do

252
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,480
not have an infection vector that is the

253
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,600
right one you will never reach out to

254
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,930
the system or the user you can try and

255
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,750
fish but no one will bait and then we

256
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,939
need communications to spread it through

257
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,210
the system to X filter information on

258
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:02,840
what matters most is the capability to

259
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:08,810
be persistent to colonize to stay and

260
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:13,220
settle down there there's

261
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:15,619
loaned or own infrastructure ideally you

262
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,690
should have your own VPS and manage it

263
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,400
that was at the beginning now it's

264
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:25,279
changed because detection capably has

265
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:28,819
changed so what the threat tries to do

266
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,490
is to stay and notice you are using

267
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,510
borrowed infrastructures using the

268
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,640
vulnerabilities from those

269
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,470
infrastructures so current a tendency

270
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,790
would be using an infrastructure that

271
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:45,290
helps us have an attack that is based on

272
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:47,510
vulnerabilities of website basically to

273
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:51,199
use it for my own profit they can be

274
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:54,200
legit Nnanji it for C&C services or just

275
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,210
for an attack but that's the trend use

276
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,460
the infrastructure that is a system use

277
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,339
its vulnerabilities to place my own code

278
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:05,330
software and web shell and from there

279
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:09,320
onwards we can use a cc trust road and

280
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:13,940
take some leaps so that I can anonymize

281
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,530
the infrastructure my attack capability

282
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,140
because we will see one of the basic

283
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:20,240
characteristics or features of cyber

284
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,490
threat is it is how difficult it is to

285
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,890
have attribution their services there

286
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,440
are people indicating who the agent

287
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,960
might be but it's difficult to have the

288
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,330
attribution for the act the perpetrator

289
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,950
it's only Clues it's only hints real

290
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,960
evidence that's very difficult we will

291
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:39,050
never help them because they will always

292
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:42,380
use mechanisms that allow them to

293
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,839
anonymize communication and as stay

294
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,570
unnoticed as we said so finding evidence

295
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,980
will always be based on an understanding

296
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,430
that this has been written in a given

297
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:55,490
language the time where the code was a

298
00:14:52,430 --> 00:15:00,319
produced maybe working hours are from a

299
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:02,150
given a time area so if this is a kind

300
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,400
of a project that has to do I don't know

301
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:09,490
with a sheep or a rail whale I will know

302
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,620
you would be interested in the topic and

303
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:15,050
so the hint will let me there so the

304
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,940
attribution will always be based on a

305
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,109
series of analysis and studies and

306
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,540
intelligence that you need for the

307
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,209
attribution but evidence per se it'll be

308
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:27,579
difficult to find

309
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:30,878
tools that we can have why do we want to

310
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:33,099
develop this del these tools well if I

311
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,879
can use a barrel to infrastructure if I

312
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,720
can use an off-the-shelf mama and if

313
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:42,730
that malwa is good for me because my

314
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:46,059
victim does not implement any security

315
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:48,850
message meshes well I will just use that

316
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:53,790
for instance the Chinese threat is quite

317
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:58,720
smart in that regard meaning that they

318
00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:02,889
they are aligned with a threat meaning

319
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,709
that if the threat the victim has no

320
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:09,850
safeguards i just used like simple tools

321
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:14,349
the moment i found more barriers the

322
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:17,319
other end they just make the means means

323
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:19,240
to carry out the attack boom they make

324
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,849
them more sophisticated so therefore

325
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,629
what i mean is that they adapt their

326
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:28,629
tools their weapons to the victim so in

327
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:32,110
any attack in any attack that prior

328
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:35,019
studies carried out so everyone connects

329
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:38,290
to the social media then they check what

330
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:39,720
are the but this person information that

331
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,519
the special displays on the social media

332
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,549
so thirty percent thirty percent of the

333
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,639
people need to expose themselves to come

334
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:50,230
out to the world so therefore that

335
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:52,569
exposition is often used to analyze

336
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:57,339
attack vectors and then to design an

337
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:59,889
attack to and that is customized an

338
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,829
attack for that victim so there are two

339
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:05,470
typical infection vectors one is the

340
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:07,569
spear fishing which is targeted attack

341
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,399
that is to say an email targeted at the

342
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,619
person then the person has been looked

343
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:13,479
into we know the hobbies of that person

344
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:15,819
whether this person has just bought a

345
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,789
car a bike so we have lots of

346
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:21,668
information that helped us sends out an

347
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:24,520
email and so that this person believes

348
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:28,809
that the email is legit that is to say a

349
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,720
transfer fee one so therefore that email

350
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:35,389
put it that it is in perfect English

351
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:39,059
perfect Spanish perfect syntax

352
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:42,000
well even if that is not that perfect in

353
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:44,639
terms of the languages should be trusted

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,330
and trusted one therefore for that as I

355
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,510
say well prior analysis so you said

356
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:55,799
researches of the victim takes place

357
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:58,440
before des act is committed and then but

358
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:01,799
they look for well they just want that

359
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:04,140
email to be trusted by the victim and at

360
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:07,049
the end they said well do not open that

361
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,630
PDF do not click on that link but at the

362
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:13,918
end of the day threats could come from

363
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:17,370
anywhere when you open up you open any

364
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,250
mail Saudi you may then load the link

365
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:25,500
through a PDF a macro Excel or

366
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:28,649
PowerPoint so this is an example of an

367
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,929
apt for instance HD cry of your America

368
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:33,299
so it did everything on the left hand

369
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:35,000
here we see on the left or the right the

370
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,350
countries that have been impacted

371
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,890
infection vector an email with

372
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:43,980
PowerPoint attached and that PowerPoint

373
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,529
had images adapted to the profile of the

374
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:50,070
victim so every time the PowerPoint was

375
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:53,610
run it unzip what it had an unusual size

376
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:57,320
it unzip a code a code developed in

377
00:18:53,610 --> 00:19:03,020
Python as far as I can remember and that

378
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:08,100
generated what else did and earns it and

379
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:11,309
then the bug took the credentials from

380
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:14,520
its own directions for their victims so

381
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,460
these were the images and we're on the

382
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,139
powerpoints and in the end it

383
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,590
decompressed it and zip this software

384
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:26,460
software that was and and it's

385
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:28,649
downloaded and installed so another

386
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,440
thing which is trendy now and actually

387
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:33,779
this is the watering hole it is very

388
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,450
much in line with a previous one so that

389
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:40,370
is to say to use a digit website we all

390
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:43,430
use a portal and portal help us

391
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:52,250
get whatever we want to get so that port

392
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:55,430
on me through that portal I the the

393
00:19:52,250 --> 00:20:01,670
malware malware code is executed and

394
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:05,300
that malicious code allow us to download

395
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:09,800
that watering or wet exploit a wet

396
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,290
exploit so you just log into a trusted

397
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,370
website whether it is a newspaper

398
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:17,360
reporter something that you use

399
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:20,090
frequently that will study our browser

400
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,530
of a plug-in several extensions and with

401
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,809
determine whether they are vulnerable or

402
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:26,600
not if they are vulnerable you will

403
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:28,790
interact with that browser so that it

404
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:35,570
will download a software is software

405
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:39,530
that will in itself download and execute

406
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:44,629
a malicious software so this is the

407
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:49,520
trend building trust passing unnoticed

408
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:52,010
that's a good way to introduce exploit

409
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,150
to determine the vulnerabilities of the

410
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:59,960
users and then they use one

411
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:01,550
vulnerability exploit after another so

412
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,820
we call it watering hole because

413
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:08,120
everyone ends up getting their exploit

414
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:11,980
kid finds out about my problem on their

415
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:15,139
abilities and some extensions are not

416
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:19,270
updated to become flash to become Java

417
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:21,760
it determines the profile of the user

418
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,840
takes a new co finds out about

419
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,590
vulnerabilities and takes it from there

420
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,510
and starts acting taking action so this

421
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,790
is the most complicated thing I may have

422
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,160
infrastructure of tools but what its

423
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,290
most important is to make it to the

424
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,790
system and here these are the infection

425
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:42,170
vectors this is the first thing that we

426
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:44,629
need to counter act and then next what

427
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,240
happens is the usual thing first of all

428
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:50,210
internal communication through lateral

429
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,250
movements for me to spread throughout

430
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,430
the system and to get to know the system

431
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,320
well in

432
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:57,540
remember that these cyber threats are

433
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,760
not in a rush whatsoever they just want

434
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:03,240
to have a deep good understanding of the

435
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,180
system before they take action so

436
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,020
lateral movements in internal

437
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:11,730
communication and then in outer external

438
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,639
communications through exfiltration

439
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,720
internal communication access into

440
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,660
internal resources getting credentials

441
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:26,160
allowing the malicious code to propagate

442
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:30,030
itself to water spread itself so what is

443
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:33,150
the valid reason DVM Apache what is the

444
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:35,129
operating system so different version

445
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,740
studies to say to have a good

446
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:41,750
understanding of this system I don't get

447
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:46,830
into know the system so that i can just

448
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:48,780
introduce the malware code adapted to

449
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,540
that victim and the same goes for

450
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:54,389
exfiltration ones haha i'm in this

451
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,820
system i can have that information and i

452
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:59,490
use it to my benefit for my benefit

453
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,490
could be any information for instance i

454
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,590
may use ransomware to hijack the system

455
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:08,430
at the end of the day it's about growing

456
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,379
and doing something which is and not

457
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,910
legit in the system and we were talking

458
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,970
about the external communication were

459
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,860
talking about data exfiltration that can

460
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,140
be done in different ways there is a

461
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,300
most advanced ways to do it that is to

462
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,190
say being unnoticed on the internet

463
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,250
which is the best way to do it while we

464
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:28,140
see it here on the screen social media

465
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,330
most of data infiltration that we are

466
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,220
seeing is done through trailer channels

467
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:38,580
or through the cloud that is say the

468
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:40,740
typical providers google dropbox we are

469
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,260
talking about services and protocols

470
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:47,160
that are common that i shared and where

471
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:48,720
no there will be no prevention there

472
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:54,740
there would be no security measures

473
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:59,580
there it would and then persistence and

474
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:04,290
while spreading or colonization so this

475
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:06,149
is what we see in serious apts and that

476
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,350
is to say the capacity not only to make

477
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,210
it there but to

478
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:11,250
stay and therefore persistence

479
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,900
mechanisms are just first of all it

480
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:19,320
passes unnoticed and then it limits the

481
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:22,530
systems and security security systems

482
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,710
and services of the system by taking

483
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:29,668
them down or continue to be passed

484
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:35,250
unnoticed so that the code is not easy

485
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:39,030
to the office gates and so that they

486
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:43,710
find how that toad has been generated or

487
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:45,629
how that code what is the procedure that

488
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,510
the code follows okay they do all that

489
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:51,240
just to prevent from being detected or

490
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:52,919
noticed so all in all everything that

491
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,840
have been said is represented in this

492
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,090
current diagram so this is

493
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:59,970
infrastructure will have an attacker

494
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:02,250
with infrastructure reduce an infection

495
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,380
system as per fishing watering hole

496
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:08,130
either of the two or both simultaneously

497
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,770
in the end the victim will just fall

498
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,870
into the fall into the trap and then the

499
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:15,750
victim will then though malware software

500
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,370
and looking for back doors to access the

501
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,350
system it was so find out information

502
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,178
about the vulnerabilities of the system

503
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,730
to take it from there and then to

504
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,799
implement the privileges and two white

505
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,840
express itself through lateral movement

506
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:31,408
lateral movements are very very useful

507
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:36,918
because they allow colonization of the

508
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:40,890
system so if you cannot really take a

509
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:44,490
security it's very difficult to provide

510
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:46,049
a security all over this system so

511
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,630
that's what they do they take advantage

512
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:50,789
of that and they colonize the system

513
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:54,840
they its proper it propagates itself

514
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:58,080
then number of utilities are instant

515
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,928
this is the rootkit so that the tool

516
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,658
that generates encrypted behavior where

517
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:07,799
information is stored difficult to

518
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:10,559
detect then the data is expedited in

519
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:13,168
different packages so that it is not

520
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:17,178
detected by the proxy so this is a

521
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:20,700
detailed study detailed research so that

522
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,149
they take their time with the one and

523
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,759
only

524
00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:25,918
detective not to be eventually detected

525
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:29,460
they just want to stay in the system and

526
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,859
to have free and full control of it so x

527
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,080
data exfiltration everything has been

528
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,639
colonized and then once the system is

529
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,960
colonized well we don't know what

530
00:26:35,639 --> 00:26:40,709
happens and then they are highly

531
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,869
perseverant so well they have the thread

532
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,549
and then we detected we make clean this

533
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:47,369
system take a number of countermeasures

534
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:50,279
in a week or in a month they are back

535
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:53,879
again another wave and another wave they

536
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,499
are never happy they persist a system

537
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:57,599
they adapt to the means to the

538
00:26:55,499 --> 00:27:03,210
environment if you close a door for them

539
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:08,729
today then short time later they come

540
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:10,169
back so this is what we what this

541
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:13,849
presentation is intended at that and

542
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:19,139
letting you know what we see in

543
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:22,950
frequently very frequently so intrusion

544
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:25,168
takes place within hours or days however

545
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,719
in terms of detecting it detecting it

546
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:29,759
may take us years and reacting or

547
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:32,219
responding to it might take us months

548
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,129
and that is also having an impact on

549
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:38,489
cybersecurity meaning that paradigm was

550
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:40,559
changing so many years ago we said that

551
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:42,389
all the services were being protected

552
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,009
that we had to protect all the systems

553
00:27:42,389 --> 00:27:47,519
we didn't want the system to have

554
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:52,609
vulnerabilities it was always no no no

555
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:56,219
but now dr. Nell is part of the past if

556
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:57,718
if you kind of work before before your

557
00:27:56,219 --> 00:27:59,969
computer will have a problem the

558
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:04,219
paradigm has changed now the paradigm is

559
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:07,379
one of resilience we want the system to

560
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:09,690
run well to have a number of security

561
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:12,678
measures implemented and to continue

562
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:15,960
working once we are impacted so that our

563
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:18,179
reactive capacity is timely it is as

564
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,099
fast as possible will have to be where

565
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:22,679
we want to be aware that I'm being

566
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:25,109
infected but I want to have that

567
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,629
detection capacity and to response as

568
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:29,309
fast as possible so that's the paradigm

569
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:32,639
that's what we talked about incident

570
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:34,499
management incident response we have to

571
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:35,070
take preventive measures so therefore

572
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:37,679
security

573
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,689
he measures and have to be adapted to

574
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,460
the functionality of the system if the

575
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:46,350
person cannot continue Ibaka will have

576
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:49,409
to soften the security system otherwise

577
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:52,620
it doesn't really make sense and i do

578
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:54,690
want to invest resources in detection

579
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,549
capacity and resilience capacity

580
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,769
resilience capacity meaning going back

581
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,990
to normal as soon as possible to restore

582
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:04,230
and to recover as soon as possible and

583
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:08,789
then changing the mindset in the mindset

584
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:11,429
of people and of people in charge of

585
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:14,190
security so threats should always be

586
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:16,379
there will always be there so protection

587
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,600
is a sufficient that's the main problem

588
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,330
that we have and also very very

589
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,559
important but it's a skia last

590
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,340
attribution which is very very difficult

591
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:28,980
also to be taken into account the

592
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:32,459
exposure service surface will continue

593
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:36,360
to grow now we bring our own device to

594
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:40,919
our companies we use social media so we

595
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:44,370
are using a wide range of devices so

596
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:47,190
therefore our exposure is growing and

597
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:50,129
growing so therefore for that we need

598
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:52,289
new paradigms the idea is not to limit

599
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:54,840
all these services and all the resources

600
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:57,620
because if we do that we will no longer

601
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,840
be very efficient we have to shift to

602
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:03,629
resilience that is to say working on

603
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,879
fostering detention capacity as well as

604
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:07,678
response capacity well have we learned

605
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:10,230
from a pt's well this is clearly

606
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,720
explained here they know much more than

607
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:16,490
we know they are many more than we are

608
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:20,580
they devote more resources than we

609
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:23,759
devote to it and they never take a break

610
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,949
they have really they insist a lot

611
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:28,320
because they come back because I found

612
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,480
another back door another vulnerability

613
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,509
you're clean just seize them and then

614
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,710
they change the excel macro they

615
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:41,399
generate a different email whatever you

616
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:44,460
name it they send you an email about a

617
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:48,029
meeting here or there or they just send

618
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,870
you hot news so they never never take a

619
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:54,030
break

620
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:58,280
they are extremely exposed so that means

621
00:30:54,030 --> 00:31:00,930
that we are facing a very very difficult

622
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,870
enemy so we cannot do it alone we cannot

623
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:08,580
work alone we have to work hand in hand

624
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:12,270
we have to bring efforts we have to

625
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:15,389
combine our efforts to find to fight

626
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:18,120
this huge threat so this is an example

627
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,750
of our own experience this is what we

628
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:25,260
have faced do this is what we have found

629
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:28,860
threats from Russia from China and this

630
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:31,320
is what we did to respond to it this is

631
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,360
how we reacted this is for you to note

632
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,450
that Sabbath threat exists this is not

633
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,340
science fiction anymore we try to fight

634
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,800
them to tackle handle them as soon as

635
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:45,649
much as best as possible so we are

636
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,649
learning every day we are allocating

637
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:53,220
increasing number of resources and well

638
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,899
our enemy is a big enemy and we're ready

639
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,900
time learning and learning and learning

640
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:02,210
and sharing and sharing and sharing if

641
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:04,559
we do not share we will get nowhere so

642
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:08,070
characteristics in the relka background

643
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:12,629
of apt so well often targeted at

644
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:15,720
companies States industries public and

645
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:18,960
private the sector it has number of

646
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:25,530
political economic and social advantages

647
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:27,990
and well these are too many examples of

648
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:31,590
threats of apts from Russia from China

649
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:34,740
we know them very well well of course

650
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:37,620
they are awesome other countries not

651
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,480
only China and Russia because all

652
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:45,989
countries now they have offensive

653
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:49,170
capacities and if some countries do not

654
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,929
have offensive capacities yet they are

655
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:54,450
acquiring them or they will acquire them

656
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:57,150
in the future threats out there and will

657
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:59,850
continue to be there people will have

658
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:02,070
more more capacities because we are move

659
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:04,830
in a different paradigm in different

660
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:09,270
cyberspace and in a different silent

661
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:13,460
world this is in the last year we've

662
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:16,260
seen a decrease of Chinese campaigns I

663
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:21,240
cannot remember what I think it says

664
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:23,850
early 2015 we talked about between 60

665
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,250
and 70 simultaneous campaign that number

666
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:29,030
has decreased especially last year we

667
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,679
don't know whether some non-aggression

668
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:37,110
agreements were signed all because they

669
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,880
were just reorganizing themselves we

670
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,709
don't know whether this is happening

671
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,720
because they are becoming less efficient

672
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:48,799
with just something so well perhaps

673
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,539
there is a higher level of security

674
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:55,500
solve the husband a turning point we've

675
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:57,600
witnessed that oh well it could be that

676
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,150
they are they have advanced so much that

677
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,959
we do not have any detection

678
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:05,039
capabilities well but anyway that

679
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,179
insistence okay they are not very

680
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:12,869
insistent anymore so now they are just

681
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:15,149
limited the dais limit Lil attached to

682
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:18,030
the just about attacks so this is an

683
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:24,330
Iranian attack who threaten as well also

684
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:28,500
North Korea we also saw what happened to

685
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:32,429
the attacks to Sony threats out there

686
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:34,590
and they will continue to move forward

687
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,200
because we are talking about Hector's

688
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:42,600
with high resources so significant

689
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:48,899
resources and Lazarus another emerging

690
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:51,480
threat is the comes from India we are we

691
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:56,399
we sometimes we do steam mandiant and

692
00:34:51,480 --> 00:35:00,450
nomenclature know me so we use panda

693
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:04,859
bears for Chinese threats and we use the

694
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:08,100
elephants for the Indian threat so this

695
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:10,710
elastics examples and we have seen it

696
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:14,000
will not stop there this will continue

697
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:17,910
to grow what have we seen in the news

698
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,190
RC hacking team CeCe's a company that

699
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:24,770
sold services and tools that was back in

700
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:30,390
2015 this year we saw equation group

701
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:33,720
that is to say tools with a capacity to

702
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:40,049
act on network infrastructures and to

703
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:41,640
infect hard disks etc then now focusing

704
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,240
on what is most important which is

705
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:49,348
cybercrime we have the very well-known

706
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:53,609
carbonic carbonic is just because it is

707
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:57,810
very very profitable so thousand million

708
00:35:53,609 --> 00:36:00,450
dollars were stolen through an ipt three

709
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:06,359
an apt they got into a bank they

710
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:09,689
selected the users a number of users

711
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:12,328
they stole the credentials and in the

712
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:14,819
end they ended up making transactions on

713
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:17,609
behalf of the administrators so in this

714
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:19,859
case that did not exfiltrate any data

715
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:25,980
they just stole 1 billion dollars and

716
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:32,869
also when attempts to hug the banking

717
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:37,079
system here we can see in 2016 35

718
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:38,940
attempt out of those transactions 30 of

719
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,869
them were blocked one of them failed

720
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:47,040
four of them succeeded and they

721
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:50,130
installed 81 billion dollars so crime is

722
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:54,950
profitable crime is profitable that's

723
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:59,069
why they devote time and resources to it

724
00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:02,848
what we said before he has the internet

725
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:07,040
portals out there you can buy a tool not

726
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:10,290
only a tool Dubai you can also buy a

727
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:14,099
hacked server with your control and

728
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:18,300
command so it is kind of a turnkey

729
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:21,380
turnkey product that you buy so here we

730
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:25,290
see the renewal of servers here in

731
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,070
bottom graph so this is the amount of

732
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:29,680
service that they use you

733
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:32,470
they offer you and then in red the

734
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:38,830
capacity to renew them they renew them

735
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:40,720
on a daily monthly some 80,000 servers

736
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:44,049
that are vulnerable they give you all

737
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,850
the whatever you need to access them

738
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,940
commander control this is the typical

739
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:52,960
dashboard for this type of services you

740
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:57,720
can log in and then use it to your

741
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:02,700
advantage well this has been quite

742
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,700
general so far perhaps I didn't tell you

743
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,890
new information but I have to tell you

744
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,930
that we are seeing it we are seeing it

745
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,940
we are detecting it with the governor

746
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,100
and we have that experience that

747
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,100
experience helped us learn from them and

748
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:20,710
little by little we are implementing

749
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,830
countermeasures and treating threats as

750
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:26,020
best as possible so that we can minimize

751
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:28,900
harm and damage that's our vocation

752
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,120
that's our mission we want to mitigate

753
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,850
threats as much as possible as best as

754
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,680
possible trends well the panorama the

755
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:37,839
outlook would not change very much I

756
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,870
would say that it will go it would get

757
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:45,240
worse this is his lied about cyber

758
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:48,609
jihadism apparently this is trendy and

759
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,709
here we also have some trading in terms

760
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:53,410
of security companies that is to say

761
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:56,320
perhaps they just want to create that

762
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:59,830
feeling of lack of security so that they

763
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,860
can offer the security services at high

764
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:06,400
high cost so perhaps this could be did

765
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:10,560
its good build and unnecessary and need

766
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,090
and cyber jihadism we are seeing it

767
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,110
perhaps he will become relevant in the

768
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:23,200
future but so far today it is not an

769
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:26,140
actual threat cyber jihadism understood

770
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,839
as cyber terrorism well one of the

771
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:33,330
pillars of cyber terrorism that is to

772
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:36,810
say this one focuses on disseminating

773
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:40,369
jihadism so nowadays will have

774
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:42,410
propaganda defacement denial of

775
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:45,289
of is so nowadays I don't have enough

776
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:48,618
capacity to have his cyber weapon to

777
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:53,509
cause a significant harm of damage to an

778
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:55,930
institution good / else can we say well

779
00:39:53,509 --> 00:40:00,230
we've taken a look at the thread are not

780
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:02,598
friends and what can we do to reduce or

781
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,970
limit cyber threats well do anything we

782
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,349
can do is to implement security what is

783
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,058
the criteria that we follow at the end

784
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:10,549
of the day is not how much you spend on

785
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:13,490
it but just to shift from the physical

786
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:15,019
world to the virtual world for instance

787
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,868
with these cards you have to go through

788
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:21,859
20 controls to put your fingerprints to

789
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:24,920
going to go to your bank to your

790
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:27,440
workplace you have will have to go

791
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:29,630
through very many security filters we

792
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,910
have assumed that for the physical world

793
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:36,049
but we haven't assumed that for the

794
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:38,509
virtual world when you are using your

795
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:40,700
computer we don't assume that we'll have

796
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:43,400
to use this same number of security

797
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:47,808
filters that you're using the physical

798
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:50,779
world so every time I level and using my

799
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:53,569
computer I have to be aware that I have

800
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:56,869
to follow a number of security measures

801
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:59,859
if we extrapolate these security

802
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:03,019
measures that we adopt and that we

803
00:40:59,859 --> 00:41:06,380
implement on the physical world to the

804
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:09,828
virtual world we will be safe we will be

805
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:15,140
more secure so it's a question of users

806
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:16,910
becoming more and more aware so it you

807
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,799
have to we have to follow a number of

808
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:24,589
procedures when it comes to using the

809
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:28,249
internet so you will have to have a

810
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:33,069
number of procedures follow them so that

811
00:41:28,249 --> 00:41:37,308
our practices are secure what else well

812
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:40,670
this is that so when you ask a security

813
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:45,230
heads of security about the problems

814
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:47,089
that i detecting the organization's the

815
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:50,829
main problem the main concern is that

816
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:53,538
they have a shortage of qualified people

817
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:54,200
qualified people or people are skilled

818
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:57,710
in

819
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,200
with the skills in security so to

820
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:02,780
implement security you have to be well

821
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,220
aware of very many technologies that

822
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:10,190
requires requires updated knowledge

823
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:14,660
updated knowledge and it requires highly

824
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:16,760
qualified personnel so 37 of personnel

825
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,920
interviews they weren't talking the one

826
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,800
not complaining about money or shortage

827
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,750
of resources of financial resources they

828
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:27,170
were complaining about a shortage of

829
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:29,390
qualified people and they also

830
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,609
complained about the lack of commitment

831
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,828
and support from top management top

832
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:38,230
management up until they faced a problem

833
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:40,670
they do not get down to fix it so we

834
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:42,530
give notes of awareness raising

835
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:45,710
campaigns because we really want to make

836
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:47,690
the top management aware that there is a

837
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,940
problem than they may need that they

838
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,619
have to fix a problem even if data

839
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,339
hasn't had an impact on their bottom

840
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:59,240
line we want to make top management

841
00:42:55,339 --> 00:43:03,440
aware of that d we don't do that through

842
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:06,379
her presentation of five hours we just

843
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:09,770
talked to them for an hour we show them

844
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:14,030
a demo of the potential damage when we

845
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:15,829
do those awareness-raising meetings top

846
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,349
management increase the level of

847
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:22,460
awareness then they talk to the managers

848
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:25,910
and they either implement measures and

849
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:29,329
one or allocate more resources to it and

850
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:31,640
then last a lack of integration in

851
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:34,430
security architecture well sometimes

852
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:38,089
projects are securities applied in the

853
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:40,430
last stage of projects when you get

854
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:42,500
designing a product or service you have

855
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:44,598
to think about security right from the

856
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,839
start right from the first phase of

857
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:51,650
design what else well for us sharing is

858
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,400
essential if we do not share we will not

859
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:57,140
be able to contract threats what we say

860
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,020
here about trust and that is really

861
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:02,779
added value of being here of what we are

862
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,670
sharing with you is because we are

863
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:09,520
sharing something that we see on a daily

864
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:09,520
basis on how to solve it how to

865
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:18,420
minimizer by sharing and how do we share

866
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:21,299
that took it's not a question of sharing

867
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,869
randomly what type of information we

868
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:27,450
want to share we want to share general

869
00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:30,930
rules samples pattern sensitive

870
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:35,118
information all in on information that

871
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:38,460
if we're to be accessed by the attacker

872
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:41,160
they will know how much we know about

873
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,989
them so what we're talking about sharing

874
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,989
information we are talking about sharing

875
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:49,259
information securely so therefore that

876
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:51,450
information that it said is safeguard so

877
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:55,920
we are talking about small groups small

878
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:57,899
groups but we can talk freely and share

879
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,200
these sensitive information freely

880
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,730
because you know that it will be handled

881
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,410
securely so you've seen something you

882
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:07,680
don't reverse engineering you have your

883
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:10,828
forensic to have you patterned you have

884
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,288
general rules on that threat if when you

885
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:17,130
transfer when you give it out the other

886
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:21,299
party that receives it does the same

887
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:25,319
thing with you so because we all have

888
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:27,329
limited resources we either do this type

889
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:29,519
of exchange and this type of sharing or

890
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:32,160
we will not be getting anywhere and we

891
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:36,180
do we are doing that from a daily basis

892
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:38,730
and conclusions well it is there it is

893
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:42,239
out there at the end of the days have a

894
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:45,150
threat is there is present it affects us

895
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:47,839
all we wrote down 600 incidents 50 of

896
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:52,109
them critically nature or 43 brother

897
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:54,119
this week every week we write a report

898
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:57,180
for the vice president of the government

899
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:59,789
we so that he knows what is happening in

900
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:02,848
terms of cyber threat 43 of them are

901
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:07,109
critical that means that we have

902
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:10,259
evidence and proof of data infiltration

903
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:14,160
the problem exists the problem is up

904
00:46:10,259 --> 00:46:16,349
there how to mitigate it through two

905
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,759
things through a one is raising of top

906
00:46:16,349 --> 00:46:25,370
managers and of users

907
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:33,170
as I said before and sharing building

908
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:36,319
trust in our partners so DC summary of

909
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:38,600
my presentation increasing ongoing

910
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,360
increasing sophistication number and

911
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,830
complexity of cyberattacks seven-speed

912
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,870
Nash has an impact on public

913
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:47,000
administration and the strategic

914
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,589
companies the idea is for the public

915
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,300
administration to be as secure as

916
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:53,390
possible the fabric administrators are

917
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:56,540
secure the citizen will be secure as

918
00:46:53,390 --> 00:47:00,100
well as our economy so this is one of

919
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:03,190
our objectives so we want public

920
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:06,560
administration and companies with

921
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:08,750
strategic interest to be secure so that

922
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,360
they have alimony system detection

923
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:15,050
system so that they are up to date in

924
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:18,230
terms of contracting threats we also do

925
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:21,440
origins we have an information plan for

926
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:23,930
the administration we also provide a

927
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,940
dock information we have lots of

928
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:28,879
experience with our reverse engineering

929
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:31,250
teams forensics so that's our added

930
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,720
value send years 10 years of experience

931
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,520
we've been working on that we are not

932
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,540
talking about reverse engineering of

933
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:43,370
forensic analysis of malware code which

934
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:46,009
is just ordinary like it's like a minor

935
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:48,589
son we are not talking about spam only

936
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:51,500
we are talking about eight or ten years

937
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:54,710
of experience working deeply with a pt's

938
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:57,110
so difficulty half attribution well we

939
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:59,330
just broke down number of flags well we

940
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:02,900
have a problem we have a problem that's

941
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:04,730
what it's actually important that's what

942
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,340
is actually important about cyber

943
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:09,620
threats it is a problem we have to be

944
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,410
there it exists there and we'll have to

945
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:16,700
put up enough barriers to mitigate the

946
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:19,819
problem threats comes from outside

947
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:22,850
country from other countries whether it

948
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:25,460
is organizations or entities with good

949
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:28,400
enough resources that all of them to do

950
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:31,370
so and here there are no friends no

951
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,980
Alice allies there are only shared

952
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:35,020
interests at a given

953
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,780
but in time I may be interested in

954
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:40,810
partnering up with you but if there is a

955
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:43,000
geopolitical interests or whatever I may

956
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:46,000
not be interested in partnering up with

957
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,920
you that happens to us every day on a

958
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,290
daily basis sometimes you want to

959
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:54,070
protect the common good sometimes the

960
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:57,460
individual good so here we cannot talk

961
00:48:54,070 --> 00:49:01,660
about friends or allies it is also

962
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:03,520
important to the intelligence capacities

963
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:06,430
intelligence capacity we should not

964
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,700
forget but we should set out requirement

965
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:12,040
and security requirement so we want

966
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:15,189
those security requirements or measures

967
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:20,890
to not to prevent the system from being

968
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:23,250
fully operational and if we do not do

969
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:25,960
that we will have someone in the company

970
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:27,940
lowering the level of security of those

971
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,460
security measures so we need to find a

972
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:32,859
balance between performance and security

973
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:35,320
and then we also have to strengthen our

974
00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:37,420
intelligence capacity when you are a

975
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:39,160
hundred fifty thousand rules or minion

976
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,740
rules do either have a data man in

977
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,839
behind it or a huge big data capacity to

978
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,910
treat that to manage and information

979
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,830
world you will not get anywhere you

980
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,868
really need to have intelligence

981
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:52,480
capacity to get to know the threat to

982
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:55,600
find out about the patterns in interest

983
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,359
the purpose of it but when it comes to

984
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:02,380
pattern managing that patterns it also

985
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:08,560
requires significant intelligence I am

986
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:12,369
finishing now so this is our tendrils of

987
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:15,190
security so we have to work like if we

988
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:16,660
were infected that means that if we work

989
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:18,760
in that fashion we know that we'll have

990
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:21,118
a problem and we want to create and

991
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,240
implement the necessary security

992
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:29,830
measures that is to say to be resilient

993
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:31,990
so putting up locks and latches we want

994
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:34,090
to make things happen but we should not

995
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:36,640
forget we just want to be resilient and

996
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:39,550
to have response capacity well these

997
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,250
seas with this I finish my presentation

998
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:45,490
and if you have any questions will be

999
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,210
happy to take them thank you very much

1000
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:57,189
Oh

1001
00:50:46,210 --> 00:51:02,369
there is a question that well before you

1002
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:06,400
showed a graph with this year as threats

1003
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:12,940
19,000 is that what about the error

1004
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:14,410
margin I mean is the high number of them

1005
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,470
that are not detected where we don't

1006
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:19,270
have that margin error margin but yes we

1007
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:21,640
are aware that there are many things

1008
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:24,310
that we do not detect well you may

1009
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:28,180
notice that we also change our CMS our

1010
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:29,950
management system systems to manage the

1011
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:33,129
incidents we are improving them we are

1012
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:35,500
adapting them you see that in November

1013
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:38,530
the stats have remained a stable that's

1014
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:41,170
because we have changed our incident

1015
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:44,170
management systems and responding

1016
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:46,000
answering your question is it do we know

1017
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:48,160
what we are not seeing no actually no

1018
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,290
but we are just improving our management

1019
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,410
system we are more into quality and not

1020
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:55,330
a match into quantity so we want to be

1021
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:57,279
more efficient in our management of

1022
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:59,259
course we want to avoid false positives

1023
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,900
and still we are getting a higher number

1024
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:04,510
of incidents it is true to say that we

1025
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,190
have to assign resources we have the

1026
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:08,109
resources that we have we are limited

1027
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:10,240
you will have more resources instead of

1028
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:13,240
detecting 19 incidents we will be

1029
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,580
detecting or seeing 40 of them so what

1030
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,459
we do is just we improve improve improve

1031
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:21,279
and we learn so that that margin becomes

1032
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:24,510
a smaller and smaller but what is there

1033
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,510
imagine I just know

1034
00:52:35,109 --> 00:52:45,980
good morning when you talk about the

1035
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:52,220
sponsored attacks not buy estates but

1036
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:55,750
but by governments you talk about

1037
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:58,549
governments and countries that are

1038
00:52:55,750 --> 00:53:01,190
strengthening the capacity to develop

1039
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:04,869
tools could you give us specific

1040
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:10,340
examples would you single out any I

1041
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:12,530
cannot but because this is sensitive

1042
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:15,650
information and do not take it as an

1043
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:19,280
excuse they are actually developing the

1044
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:21,740
capacity we are monitoring them we have

1045
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,599
seen them the type of capacities they

1046
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:27,229
are strengthened in developing i just

1047
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:29,359
cannot say and what we have shown on the

1048
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:31,280
screen is something that you may

1049
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:33,890
download from the internet many of those

1050
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,349
data came from the source was carb risky

1051
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:38,598
it is public information but i've just

1052
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:41,270
shown you but it is true that we have

1053
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:43,280
detected that those capacities are those

1054
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:45,730
states are drawing increasing the

1055
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,140
capacity and the same goes for any

1056
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:50,270
country where we know that in some

1057
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:54,140
countries have more weapons more

1058
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:57,290
physical weapons and now in terms of

1059
00:53:54,140 --> 00:54:00,920
cyber space while all states will have

1060
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:03,349
offensive and defensive capacities how

1061
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:05,599
much well some of them didn't have any

1062
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:07,369
they are just starting others who had

1063
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,830
them they are just strengthening them

1064
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:15,190
but i cannot be more specific in my

1065
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:15,190
answer another question there

1066
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,579
[Music]

1067
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:39,100
alright whatever how feasible is

1068
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,590
international cooperation bearing in

1069
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:44,110
mind that these entails conflict of

1070
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:47,260
interest with cyber intelligence meaning

1071
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:49,660
that some countries surely will not want

1072
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:54,520
to disclose or to share information to

1073
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:58,240
other states for many reasons because

1074
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:02,380
well some countries see the other

1075
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:04,419
country as a threat well it is a sin

1076
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,340
real life when you have a problem where

1077
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:10,110
you have a disease surely you will do

1078
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:13,510
everything at your hand to resolve it

1079
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:15,070
yes and when countries have problem we

1080
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,200
help out each other there are mechanisms

1081
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:19,330
there are mechanisms of there and then

1082
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:24,730
yes countries end up helping each other

1083
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:26,470
so I cannot be more specific we do it we

1084
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:29,590
share information with change

1085
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:31,089
information we share the problem so it

1086
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:33,640
is not that we've been doing these four

1087
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:35,380
thousand years we are we've been

1088
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:39,910
improving with proving quite a lot

1089
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:44,320
recently and we have these meetings

1090
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:51,430
where countries entities have problem

1091
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:53,740
and we need to help each other it is

1092
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:55,870
true it is true what I'm saying and

1093
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,109
there are mechanisms and for gay

1094
00:55:55,870 --> 00:56:02,080
countries find a way to help each other

1095
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:05,350
you first you need to build trust about

1096
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:09,150
once you trust these bills we do it it

1097
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:09,150
is part of our work actually

1098
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:29,720
hello congratulations for the

1099
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:31,550
presentation I know that the reset

1100
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:36,339
European directive that has has been

1101
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:40,700
recently passed establishing

1102
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:46,430
collaboration between member states in

1103
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:48,020
terms of incidence certs etc I know that

1104
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:51,140
in the spin that have very many certs

1105
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:54,340
both regionally and nationally is there

1106
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:57,440
any kind of coordination between these

1107
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:59,090
emergency response teams yes we're

1108
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,950
working on it well I don't focus on that

1109
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:03,350
when we talk about cybersecurity I'm

1110
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:05,540
talking about early warning we are

1111
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:10,220
talking about the different certs here

1112
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:13,940
and there with regard to but what do you

1113
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:15,680
just said transposition of the knees

1114
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:18,170
directive we are working on that I'm

1115
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,000
actually involved in the working team

1116
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:22,520
for the transposition of it we are

1117
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,560
working with the various cell relevant

1118
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:33,140
ministries so that directive as we were

1119
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:36,650
well sir is establishes or help us

1120
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:39,230
strengthen coordination coordination of

1121
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:42,370
the different stakeholders so that

1122
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:44,930
directive will help us will help us to

1123
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:46,310
set out above requirements our

1124
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:48,799
competencies and to establish

1125
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:53,509
coordination mechanisms we're working on

1126
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:55,550
it we are on it so it is very point in

1127
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:58,220
time we are developing it and to tell

1128
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:02,000
you more it has the deadline is the end

1129
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:03,759
of the year we are establishing we have

1130
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,900
to establish a single point of contact

1131
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,330
coordination of course we do have

1132
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:11,150
coordination well as I said before we

1133
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:13,610
have a vocation of service we want we

1134
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:15,170
are demanding public administrations to

1135
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:17,360
be more secure but public

1136
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:19,790
administrations are limited in resources

1137
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:22,580
so we offer them these resources web

1138
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:25,100
auditing we offer do services through

1139
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:28,960
our portals we give you a what early

1140
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:32,060
warning system I think out of the 19 a

1141
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,500
community's 15 have implemented the

1142
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,450
early warning system there are only

1143
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:38,240
three autonomous communities valet

1144
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:40,069
yeah Barcelona and alissa de andalucía

1145
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,930
they have their own search what do we do

1146
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:44,840
with them we exchanged with you exchange

1147
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:46,910
a will have a tool ticketing for the

1148
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,700
exchange of technology we are federating

1149
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:51,890
ourselves that another coordination

1150
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:56,000
coordination between the two I'm not

1151
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:57,770
going into I don't go into your cert but

1152
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,230
I share the incidents that you have we

1153
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:01,820
have implemented that with the

1154
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:04,010
Andalusian region we are federated

1155
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:07,520
already we will be doing that very soon

1156
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:10,400
