collaborative effort to share thread

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:37,120
data in a valid member community

8
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:38,949
this session will introduce the aPWG

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,290
and its Clearing House approach to

10
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:43,449
sharing electronic crime data there

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,820
Ekrem exchange is a platform designed to

12
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:49,420
provide threat data between the aPWG

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,910
member community the ACX repository

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,969
provides real-time information for

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,129
blocking malicious URLs and other data

16
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:59,260
be a restful happy to help protect the

17
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:02,349
users and organizations from criminal

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,019
and fraudulent entities so I hope you

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,119
enjoyed this afternoon with Foy and Mike

20
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:22,570
please give a big applause to for

21
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:24,340
Schieber and mike D'Ambrosio thank you

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,250
yes thank you very much good afternoon

23
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,170
and thanks for joining us this afternoon

24
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,060
go talk a little bit about I'm gonna

25
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,820
start out just to open and talk about

26
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:41,320
who and what a little bit of what aPWG

27
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:44,439
is and the clicker there we go

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,908
push the other button that worked the

29
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,669
ante phishing working group was founded

30
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:52,149
in 2003 originally we strictly focused

31
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:53,710
on fishing there was about four or five

32
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:56,590
of us got together just to look at this

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,780
new phenomenon that was taken over the

34
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:02,320
industry we saw with the pH and phishing

35
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,990
and I'm from there we built together a

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,019
collaborative group of interested

37
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,340
parties so our membership has grown now

38
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:12,700
to include different financial

39
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:15,250
institutions ISPs a lot of you

40
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,380
technology companies law enforcement

41
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,690
agencies including a lot of your

42
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,790
research groups like universities the

43
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,819
different communities

44
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,069
yeah computer emergency response teams

45
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,500
around the world we work with those guys

46
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,480
different treaty organizations just

47
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,709
interested folks that are working in

48
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,980
cybercrime specifically over the years

49
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,500
as we've been working we've expanded so

50
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,149
as crime and fraud have evolved through

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,790
the years the anti-phishing working

52
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,760
group has grown and evolved to cover

53
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,620
other areas so some of the areas we look

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,069
at now is we get involved a lot in cyber

55
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:57,180
policy we work with ICANN the EU

56
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,608
government the US government Asian

57
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,889
governments as well to talk and advise

58
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:05,280
on different aspects of fighting

59
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:07,409
electronic crime we do a lot of work in

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,810
education and user awareness we have a

61
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:13,679
global program called stop think connect

62
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,599
that we use to help what I like to say

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,730
is upgrade our users a little bit to

64
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,339
make them more aware of the threats that

65
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,608
are out there and how to work and

66
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,169
operate safely on the Internet

67
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:28,079
over the years from the beginning we

68
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:29,730
also have been tracking trends so we do

69
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,519
quarterly reports and annual reports

70
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:36,149
where we look at statistics and the

71
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,250
phenomenons phenomenons in that are of

72
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,780
malicious activity the actors that are

73
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,190
out there what are they doing what are

74
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,829
the threats that we see coming down the

75
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,260
road we report those out we've been

76
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:49,049
doing that for 1213 years now so you can

77
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,620
see a evolution of what's going on out

78
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,480
there in the electronic crime field the

79
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,799
two areas we're going to talk to mainly

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,660
today I'm going to talk to you a little

81
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,819
bit our bure about our research programs

82
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,980
and then mine's going to get a little

83
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,750
more into the threat data sharing and

84
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,750
more the technology side of what we do

85
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,370
from a research side and this is what I

86
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,459
think will be interesting to a lot of

87
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:17,099
the attendees here is we run an annual

88
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,949
program called our symposium on

89
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:22,469
electronic crime research this is a peer

90
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,199
reviewed process where we review the

91
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:29,099
papers the accepted papers are then

92
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,260
published we run two tracks so the first

93
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:34,469
track is for theoretical cybercrime

94
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,840
academic research so these are

95
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,640
the actual you know our students our

96
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,119
university favor we're working on their

97
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,130
PhDs have some research they need to get

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,470
published if you want to get a PhD you

99
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,330
need to publish your papers this is one

100
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,210
of the things we focus on and these

101
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,340
papers are all revolving around

102
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,830
electronic crime to date we've published

103
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,789
over a hundred and twenty papers through

104
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:03,240
the I Triple E as well those papers that

105
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:06,300
we accept we then fly one author from

106
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,610
each paper into our annual event our

107
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,190
next event will be in San Diego next May

108
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,800
and so they get to present their work to

109
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,940
the industry in this process you get

110
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,860
introduced to a lot of organizations

111
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,870
like Microsoft Google Symantec IBM blah

112
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,840
blah blah all the big security companies

113
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,850
in the industry and quite a few people

114
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,380
end up getting uh employment through it

115
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,960
so I highly encourage you if you're

116
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,750
working on some research that you get

117
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,169
your papers in we also run a second

118
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,760
track for industry one of the things we

119
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,260
found there's not a lot of facility if

120
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,930
you're working in industry and you're

121
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,450
doing some research we try to help you

122
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,950
get those papers published as well if

123
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,229
you're working in industry and you

124
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,640
publish your paper we kind of expect you

125
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,260
to pay your own way to come to the event

126
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,680
and present your work since you do have

127
00:05:52,260 --> 00:06:01,500
a job and the students do not owe and

128
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,600
also we do offer a cash award for the

129
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,400
two best players each year so uh a

130
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,490
little money in your pocket never hurts

131
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:14,310
or anything outside of that we also have

132
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,419
a European foundation that we set up in

133
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,430
2013 now the European foundation does

134
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,240
its own research and awareness projects

135
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,530
and those are currently running

136
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,010
primarily funded through their horizon

137
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:32,039
2020 programs and in that program we've

138
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:34,530
got three going on right now the V vet

139
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,610
program is creating educational

140
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:42,539
materials for vocational studies to help

141
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:45,300
students the true sec is creating a

142
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,780
program through the EU for a security

143
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,220
seal

144
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:52,340
so educational programs and different

145
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,930
organizations that are working in cyber

146
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,159
can get a kind of like what we would

147
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,620
call in the States a Good Housekeeping

148
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,110
Seal of Approval I don't know if we have

149
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,750
a similar program in the EU like that

150
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,940
but just a program to evaluate and say

151
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,130
these programs are valid you should look

152
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,740
into them good education process and

153
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:14,300
then we're also developing through the

154
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:18,419
EU foundation a cyber volunteer network

155
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,640
so this will be a program basically

156
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:25,320
you'll have apps that you could install

157
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,810
and users are our cyber volunteers will

158
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,380
have the opportunity to get certified

159
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:35,970
and become part of the network so let's

160
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:39,120
say I'm a teacher you know and I want to

161
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,430
help educate my students I could use

162
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,530
this network to help schedule and find

163
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:45,180
someone to come in and talk to my

164
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,820
students

165
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,380
and help raise their awareness again so

166
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,099
just some programs we've got going on

167
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,770
there to raise the awareness throughout

168
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,150
Europe specifically focused within the

169
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:02,729
European Union beyond that now to get to

170
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,010
more of the technical side is going to

171
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:08,039
talk to you a little bit about the AP

172
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:11,130
wgz crime exchange in our data sharing

173
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,229
program push button right great hi

174
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,659
everybody I'm Mike D Ambrosia and as Phi

175
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,830
was saying I am the technical guy and

176
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,450
what I'm going to show you today is just

177
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,500
a real brief we've only got a limited

178
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,969
amount of time there's quite a bit of

179
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,110
depth to this but what I'm going to do

180
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,270
is just give you some surface level

181
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,410
information on how we share data and

182
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,909
what our experience has been as Floyd

183
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:33,300
was talking about the programs earlier

184
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:36,360
the ECX that I'm exchange which we refer

185
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,338
to as the ECX as a free service for aPWG

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,349
member so there's no additional cost to

187
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,320
be able to use the data sharing side of

188
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,670
the aPWG so the mission for what we're

189
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,650
trying to accomplish here is just to be

190
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,729
a best-in-class data sharing framework

191
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:54,240
where high performance framework things

192
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,890
happen quickly we're trying to limit the

193
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,569
access into the system to people that we

194
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:02,809
know are known good actors

195
00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:04,069
we handled we handle sharing of really

196
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,449
any type of threat data and I'm going to

197
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:07,189
show you I'm going to talk a little bit

198
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:09,889
about some of the workgroup features and

199
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:11,809
we make data available nearly instantly

200
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,730
to everybody that comes in we turn it

201
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:16,309
around fast we bring it in scrub it up

202
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,709
get it right back out and back into you

203
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:20,480
so that people can use it to protect the

204
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:22,309
public Ori for your research or academic

205
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,919
or whatever it is that you're doing with

206
00:09:22,309 --> 00:09:27,290
it one of the big goals is we want to

207
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:28,999
try and drive data towards users and we

208
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,209
use an alerting system when data comes

209
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:34,160
into the system we scan it we look for

210
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:37,579
matches for patterns where people have

211
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,738
said show me when TLD comes in that I'm

212
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:41,358
interested in we can send you an email

213
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:43,329
alert and get that information out to

214
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:45,829
you right away

215
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,878
one of the big things is is I don't know

216
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:49,309
how many of you out here are already

217
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,829
using existing threat platforms and tool

218
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:54,199
kits but what we didn't want to do was

219
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:57,679
create yet another platform that you had

220
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:59,299
to log in to scan the data that way we

221
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,919
wanted to do is give you a robust API

222
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:04,009
behind the scenes I'm going to talk a

223
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,999
little bit about that and finally we've

224
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:15,249
been doing this for a while

225
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:18,860
his appointment me sorry buddies wait so

226
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:22,160
this started back in 2003 just a brief

227
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,779
history our chairman Dave Jevons went to

228
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,069
an industry dinner in San Francisco

229
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:27,259
where he met with some other banking

230
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,488
people everybody over the dinner was

231
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,589
complaining about the fact that they

232
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:31,879
were all facing the same threats but

233
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,769
they were not talking to each other

234
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:35,809
about what was going on and so the idea

235
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:37,730
spawned at that point in time let's

236
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:39,529
share data of all these banking entities

237
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,999
some large banking entities in the

238
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:43,129
States along with some emerging

239
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:45,470
electronic banking such as PayPal were

240
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:48,499
all there in attendance Dave went home

241
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,749
in his living room basically crafted up

242
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:52,879
a system of servers and networks email

243
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:54,739
started coming in from all the banks we

244
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,899
collated all that information and this

245
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:59,029
started distributing it back out kind of

246
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,439
similar to what the pallet off the

247
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:01,939
network I was talking about if you saw

248
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:03,799
that presentation where they share data

249
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:05,899
with Symantec and some of their other

250
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:08,749
competitors these banks as well we're

251
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,459
sharing data amongst themselves it was

252
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:11,270
an email based system it didn't scale

253
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:13,099
very well

254
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:17,470
but there was a very small sharing group

255
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,470
and so that lives on until today

256
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,199
there you go so ECX is built into two

257
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,149
sides there's the web interface where

258
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:33,040
you can come in and enroll take a look

259
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,170
at data it's a very sort of thin

260
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,680
interface and then the real power behind

261
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,628
the scenes is the API and we use a REST

262
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,370
API gentleman before us that was

263
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,439
speaking was talking about the REST API

264
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,680
that comes with Azur we do a similar

265
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:49,120
sort of thing as well exposing some of

266
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,888
the technology that we've got that we've

267
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,319
built on we use a lambda style lamp

268
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:55,720
stack and what lambda means or is in use

269
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:57,550
these days is that you have hot data and

270
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,990
warm data so we have data that we make

271
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,670
available instantly and then we have

272
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,680
data that we curate bomb from behind the

273
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,319
scenes metadata and then we bring that

274
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,239
in that takes a little while longer

275
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:11,378
eventually everything syncs up so we use

276
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,759
PHP we're a PHP shop we do behind the

277
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:15,519
scenes messaging where we send messages

278
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,920
out for jobs just to spawn and go out

279
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,709
and find additional data we use RabbitMQ

280
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,540
for that MySQL is used this is the

281
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,920
repository of truth that's where we keep

282
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,889
all of our data in but it's heavily

283
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,439
indexed and elastic we use log stash

284
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:31,209
Cabana we've tracked files that we have

285
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:32,529
on the system through file beats and we

286
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,660
use an alerting system called the last

287
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:36,610
alert which is done by Yelp we've added

288
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,670
that in as well and then we have a

289
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,410
legacy indexing system Spink search that

290
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,660
we're trying to get rid of memcache

291
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,939
helps us with speed and then we're very

292
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,680
distributed because we run on AWS and

293
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:50,110
that helps us be able to deploy new

294
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,550
instances quickly and be able to respond

295
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:57,220
to additional workload that comes up so

296
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,750
quickly on the side one we've said that

297
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,589
there were two sides to this on side one

298
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:04,809
the web user interface we store data and

299
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:06,279
we make it visible in either modules or

300
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:10,149
workgroups and the differences is that

301
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:11,829
modules are data that we gather curate

302
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:13,720
bring into the system normalize and

303
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:16,779
we're responsible for that work groups

304
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,759
allow users to be able to come in create

305
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,499
their own data schema basically hold any

306
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,899
sort of data that you've got out there

307
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,939
you create the schema sort of think of

308
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:26,290
it as Excel where you name each column

309
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:28,599
whatever it is you want to put in that

310
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,219
column we do a similar sort of thing we

311
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,309
allow you to create ad hoc sharing

312
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,509
groups so you can bring your data in and

313
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:37,390
and store it within that and then figure

314
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:39,460
out who you want to share it with

315
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,319
inside the web interface we provide a

316
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,370
little bit of filtering I'll show you

317
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,950
some examples of that and some

318
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,360
screenshots that we've got and it just

319
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,860
gives you an easy way just to go in and

320
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,000
kind of do some ad hoc searching so you

321
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,250
can kind of see what's going on with the

322
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,380
data that you're interested in it is a

323
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,450
close community as I've said you must be

324
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,950
an aPWG member to use it and this allows

325
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,780
us to know that people that we're

326
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,400
sharing data with are vetted so that

327
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,560
takes the original concept of those

328
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,750
original banks and extends it out maybe

329
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,949
another layer so we don't want to do is

330
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,390
provide it off to the public because

331
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,620
then we don't have real control over the

332
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,850
data we don't know where it's coming in

333
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,690
from this way we know who's who I

334
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,750
mentioned that we've got data that gets

335
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,590
driven out with the alerts we provide

336
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,850
all sorts of API documentation we use a

337
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,490
documentation tool built for API is

338
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,140
called swagger and in github there are a

339
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,420
ton of tools to be able to work with

340
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,000
swagger Docs where you can build clients

341
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,620
and change your documentation around as

342
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,670
far as the presentation style goes lots

343
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,940
of stuff you can do with it it's very

344
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,229
flexible and so the concept that we've

345
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,030
got here is is that things are really

346
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,400
complex back behind the scenes but using

347
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:47,260
this web interface it kind of keeps

348
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,939
things simple for you so this is really

349
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,550
where the meat of the matter lies which

350
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:56,880
is with the high performance REST API

351
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:56,880
everybody uses an API before so I'm good

352
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:05,500
we use basically two main operations I

353
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,360
get which gathers the data out that

354
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,580
where you put in a command it returns

355
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,010
data back to you a post is where you

356
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,250
send us data a patch is where you would

357
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,540
change data and options just it's a way

358
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,420
that the API tells you what's available

359
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,420
as far as services go we use one

360
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,890
interface for the entire ECX application

361
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,569
is to make it simple and easy and then

362
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,090
we use different endpoints to represent

363
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,740
different buckets of data as we keep all

364
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,320
of the fish data in one bucket that's

365
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:36,090
represented by the fish endpoint we have

366
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:40,780
a malicious IP which contains scanners

367
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:43,090
botnet activity login attempts and that

368
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,890
comes from PayPal actually it's the only

369
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,780
place where that data comes from or were

370
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,699
the only people that end up having that

371
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,410
data

372
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:54,650
we do user validation through a token

373
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,180
and we have a pretty robust set of query

374
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,040
parameters to allow you to be able to

375
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,569
dig in find the data that you're really

376
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,420
interested in and dig it back out

377
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,160
quickly we allow you to paginate through

378
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,860
the data so that the results that

379
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,600
actually shows you your on page 1 of 50

380
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,860
odd pages and then it gives you the

381
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,720
links to be able to surf through the

382
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,280
next couple of pages so you have

383
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,110
complete control over the results that

384
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:19,400
with that fast that's the big thing we

385
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,020
wanted something that that's scaled

386
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,030
really well where we could continue to

387
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:27,319
add more and more users as it as the

388
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:29,000
aPWG grows so we can return we take your

389
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,650
query again we parse it out we figure

390
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,360
out what data you want we gather the

391
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,100
data we put it in together in a packet

392
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,000
and we send it back out to you and that

393
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,210
happens in under two hundred

394
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,560
milliseconds we provide our testing

395
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:43,100
sandbox for you so you can come in and

396
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,050
play around a little bit with it we pick

397
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,880
up the last I don't know maybe four

398
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:48,229
hours of live production data so you've

399
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
actually got some real data to work with

400
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,820
and kind of test your queries against

401
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,410
and then oh I should have started with

402
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,870
this to begin with if you want to take a

403
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,610
look at the way that we output the data

404
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,010
the URL at the bottom of the screen here

405
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,720
is a zip file I put together last night

406
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,099
that shows the output and I'll move out

407
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:13,610
of the way so those of you with cameras

408
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:19,550
can can take a look so the zip file

409
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:22,520
contain a cut of the fish endpoint the

410
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,649
malicious IP endpoint and we have a sort

411
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,810
of a honeypot of email if you're

412
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,730
interested in email analysis and looking

413
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,070
for trends and email scams and phishing

414
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,590
we have a honeypot that we bring in at

415
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,629
report fishing at aPWG org all those

416
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,070
emails go in there also available

417
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:44,450
through the API I'll show you that in a

418
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:47,030
web interface as well so sending as data

419
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,520
is easy really easy we take four fields

420
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,899
that's it the date that the whatever

421
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,690
information you're sending us isn't in

422
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,880
the way a fish is foreseen the brand

423
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,760
that the fish is trying to attack the

424
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,140
URL of the fish and a confidence this

425
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,010
happens to how confident you are that

426
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,150
this is

427
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:06,530
actually fish and we use three three

428
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,930
consistent values a hundred percent

429
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,180
means that you've seen this with your

430
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,800
own eyes that you know for sure that

431
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,690
this is a fish and ninety is that this

432
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,580
is a machine process as identified this

433
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,500
as fish and you're sending it to us that

434
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,250
way fifty I don't know it could be maybe

435
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,950
maybe not

436
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,720
and we've used the same format since the

437
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:26,420
original days of 2003 when this was put

438
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,460
together within that banking dinner we

439
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,830
validate the data we accept it we

440
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,990
normalize it we turn it back around and

441
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,250
the insert happens in less than 75

442
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,960
milliseconds so again we're really

443
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,300
interested in speed here in tuning and

444
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,700
then we have a complete set of robust

445
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,620
result code so that when you perform

446
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,840
your operation the API tells you through

447
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,760
these result codes was it successful was

448
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,500
there an error if so what was the air to

449
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,010
help you programmatically put your

450
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,240
scripts together so I'm going to run

451
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,070
through a couple of screenshots of the

452
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,990
application this is the web interface

453
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,520
and so what you see here this is the

454
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,990
main page when you log in so you get a

455
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,129
little graphing and charting that kind

456
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,460
of gives you the general state of the

457
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:06,830
nation as we see it and then as I

458
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,200
mentioned we have full documentation for

459
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,540
the API so up on the top there you see

460
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,610
you've got your API key you've got the

461
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,440
base URL to get to the API and then

462
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,340
you've got down below if you scroll the

463
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,380
screen down you see all the

464
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,520
documentation for each module that's

465
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:24,170
within here one of the cool things about

466
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,850
swagger as I mentioned using that as a

467
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,190
documentation platform is it'll auto

468
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,530
generate API clients for you so if you

469
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,710
work in go you work in Python you work

470
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,720
in Java all of those using the swagger

471
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,970
documentation you can fast track and

472
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,400
build a base API client that you can

473
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,690
then extend out it's what we try and do

474
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,820
is get you going really quickly through

475
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,710
this and inside of that auto-generated

476
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,240
in the green circle there are a series

477
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,380
of about seven different clients that

478
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,920
are available for you to download it

479
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:53,390
right away so going quickly through the

480
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,890
modules you can see right there that

481
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,080
we've got the fish the malicious IP

482
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,670
which is the PayPal feed and then the

483
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,649
report phishing which is the emails

484
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,410
those are all located under modulus this

485
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,450
is data that we support maintain and

486
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,040
then you've got in parentheses you've

487
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,180
got the endpoint that you would use in

488
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,730
order to get through that data through

489
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,670
the API this is an example screen

490
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,170
showing the phishing data it's hard to

491
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,970
see from right here

492
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,560
so date discovered the brand the

493
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,760
confidence level in the URL those are

494
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,590
the four fields that we've got right

495
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,360
there the status indicates whether or

496
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:25,159
not the fish is still active or if it's

497
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,199
been knocked down and taken care of if

498
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,030
it's still a threat or not and then you

499
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,650
can edit the information from inside of

500
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:35,120
here using the blue button on the far

501
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:37,460
right hand side one of the nice things

502
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,080
about using this data table presentation

503
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,940
here is we've got column filtering at

504
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,919
the very bottom of the data table so you

505
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,900
can put in whatever you want to know you

506
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,370
want to put in a substring for you're

507
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,930
only looking for URLs that have a

508
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,699
particular string and you can put that

509
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,260
in the bottom there a data table will

510
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,910
filter that down and only show you those

511
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,710
results so in the next slide you're

512
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,470
gonna see I've taken the very last entry

513
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:01,330
on the list there with the MAS lrg club

514
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:05,110
URL and filtered it down to just that

515
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:07,060
they've found one results in the system

516
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,500
it's a quick way to kind of get a handle

517
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:12,100
visually on what's going on within the

518
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,710
data that you might be interested in

519
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:18,469
this is the malicious IP data this is a

520
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,780
series of as I said scanners BOTS login

521
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:24,820
attacks and so on it shows the IP where

522
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,080
this information was generated from and

523
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,480
PayPal sends this to us we get a good

524
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:33,350
feed in here we've got about 10 million

525
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,450
entries in this in this data set and

526
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,159
this is the report fishing data set

527
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,870
again all of the interface through each

528
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,850
of the modules here uses the same data

529
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,310
table so you've got the same pagination

530
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,600
column filtering ability to take a look

531
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,129
at the data scroll up and down and

532
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,419
change your results that's in addition

533
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,620
with this one this was kind of

534
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,880
interesting because on the right hand

535
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,879
side here we actually show you the

536
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,080
source that's inside of the email so

537
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,420
what I've done here is I've clicked on

538
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,590
the show button for the headers and for

539
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,390
those of you interested in email

540
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,870
information you can see the header

541
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,400
information right here already so then

542
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:08,540
you can set up your queries in the API

543
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,010
and begin to bring this out work groups

544
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,170
is a real powerful feature that we like

545
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,400
it's deep it's kind of technical I'm not

546
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,790
going to get into it today but the

547
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,100
overarching concept is you can set up

548
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,600
your own container that holds your

549
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,490
specific type of data you can store

550
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,010
basically any sort of data in there and

551
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,179
using the same API that we use for our

552
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,320
modules you can use that for your data

553
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,690
and then figure out who you want to

554
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,939
share that with same you can add and

555
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,649
take data out of that repository and

556
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,899
then you have member control over who

557
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:38,369
has access to it so these are the first

558
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:40,080
ones that we've got in here right now

559
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:41,488
we've got a Bitcoin data exchange with a

560
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,559
bunch of Bitcoin information a little

561
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:46,049
bit of ransomware oriented type stuff in

562
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:50,249
there the IRS is the United States

563
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:52,049
taxing entity Authority there are people

564
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:55,259
calling around right now saying you owe

565
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:59,129
the IRS money send us a gift card with a

566
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:03,239
payment at this at this address we track

567
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:05,549
SMS fish and then malicious domains and

568
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:06,989
then finally this is the alerts section

569
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:08,580
would be would be located in here which

570
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:10,710
I've talked briefly about it where when

571
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,939
data comes into the system the system

572
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,499
checks it in real time

573
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,599
looks for a pattern match that you've

574
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:18,839
set up already a particular domain name

575
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,489
a TLD of brands if there's a match made

576
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,379
there it'll send you an email we also

577
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:25,469
hook into slack channels for those of

578
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:28,339
you that use slack and then this is just

579
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:30,539
your peers your standard profile

580
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:36,149
demographic information phone change

581
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:39,749
password and so on so since this is sort

582
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:42,149
of a research and a learning conference

583
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:44,089
I wanted to kind of just finish up here

584
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:45,959
with some best practices that we see

585
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,190
first of all a lot of people don't read

586
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,690
the documentation we've got a really

587
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,820
robust set of documentation available

588
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,129
for you spend some time read it figure

589
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,809
out what the options are we get our logs

590
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:58,289
messed up bad with people which I'm

591
00:23:54,809 --> 00:24:00,509
gonna figure it out on the fly an API is

592
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:03,119
designed to be beat on use it use it a

593
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:05,279
lot we like to see people making a

594
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,928
request about one per second or so in

595
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,179
the past we've had people that only make

596
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:12,359
a request one time for per day and

597
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:14,549
that's 24 hours or what 23 hours and 59

598
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:16,139
minutes of exposure where there's data

599
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:19,349
available to you that you could be using

600
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:21,809
in there so work with the API query it a

601
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:23,399
lot in order to do that you're gonna

602
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:26,129
want to keep track of the last time that

603
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:28,228
you query we have a highest ID parameter

604
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:30,299
that comes back so you can say this was

605
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:31,649
the last ID that I got give me

606
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,479
everything from that point forward and

607
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:37,468
you can do the same thing with with the

608
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:39,830
date modified and then know your data

609
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:41,360
set use the UI use the

610
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,649
web frontend in order to be able to poke

611
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,789
around in there and figure out the data

612
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,918
that you're interested in what would

613
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:47,149
that pattern be how would I query that

614
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,919
inside of the API what would I be

615
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:54,709
looking for and as we all know bad

616
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,899
actors changed up their their game off

617
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,710
and in order to be able to maintain

618
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:03,229
their attacks and and be effective it's

619
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,279
a good word so what you're going to be

620
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,260
looking for it's going to change over

621
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:08,029
time so as those threats begin to get

622
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,679
knocked down the bad actors are going to

623
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:11,149
change the way they do business they're

624
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,220
gonna come back in with new threats so

625
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:14,809
you need to go back in and check every

626
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,159
once in a while to make sure that what

627
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:17,928
you've actually think you're looking for

628
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:22,010
is actually in the data set and if they

629
00:25:17,929 --> 00:25:25,429
haven't changed that and so this is real

630
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:28,158
quickly how to run an API so the very

631
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:30,769
top entry would return all the fish that

632
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:34,820
we have on file as of right now working

633
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:36,980
in descending order the next one you can

634
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,510
specify fields so if there's fields I

635
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,159
know in the EU there's some sensitivity

636
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,240
around information some of the stuff you

637
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,070
don't want you don't want to have in

638
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,260
your possession you can figure out using

639
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,908
the fields parameter which fields you

640
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,120
want to get back so you can avoid the

641
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:52,120
things that you might not want to get

642
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,768
you can look for specific brands and

643
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,178
then you can do wildcard searches so I

644
00:25:54,769 --> 00:25:58,010
threw this search actually in there last

645
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,500
night with the model gap

646
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,658
wildcard is to see and it found 75

647
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:05,510
entries in our data set for it and then

648
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:06,950
you can mix and match wild cards or I'm

649
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,450
sorry query parameters within that so

650
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:13,340
you can you can run multiple query

651
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:14,389
parameters at the same time so the other

652
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,799
thing I thought I'd share with you or

653
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:17,120
what are the obstacles and problems that

654
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:18,620
we've got with data sharing data sharing

655
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,299
should be important right the more data

656
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,689
we share the more effective we are as an

657
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:25,870
industry so I broke it down into three

658
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,399
sections technology legal in business

659
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:30,620
but within the technology section and

660
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:32,418
this one that really surprises me we use

661
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,219
the REST API we've get feedback that

662
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,840
people find it difficult for some reason

663
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,960
there's this technology that's been

664
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,269
around for over 12 almost 13 years and

665
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,120
it's very well established yet people in

666
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:45,679
this industry don't seem to use it very

667
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,510
easily we get a little bit of pushback

668
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,639
on it so it started originally with

669
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,129
Flickr and Facebook and Twitter back in

670
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:54,110
2002 2003 those were the first releases

671
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,460
of rest api s

672
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,750
the other problem that we see is when we

673
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,340
start training people up we get high

674
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,050
industry turnover as everybody's

675
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,429
mentioned this morning if you sat in on

676
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:03,649
some of the other presentations that

677
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,110
there's a real need for engineers in

678
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,610
this space right now battling cybercrime

679
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,110
and so people when they come in they

680
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:10,820
tend to move along and they move up and

681
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,800
they get promoted and they move around a

682
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:14,360
lot so the person we trained today could

683
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,159
be gone next week someone new comes in

684
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,810
to take the place they're not very well

685
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:26,330
trained so we need to continue to train

686
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:28,909
people constantly yeah this is an

687
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,530
interesting one it's ones that kind of

688
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,120
surprises us at least in the states is

689
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,830
that we're not seeing a lot of people

690
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,679
coming into a job knowing how to use

691
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:38,179
api's and technology like this we're not

692
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,610
kind of surprising we see people just

693
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:42,800
wanting to can't you just send me by

694
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,570
email a CSV file that's got all the data

695
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:49,250
and it was like no this is much better

696
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:50,689
way to go about doing things and then we

697
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:55,130
still see a lot of people wanting to use

698
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:57,110
that email CSV file sharing standard and

699
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,520
it just doesn't work it's got its

700
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,550
riddled with latency this is a much

701
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,590
better solution from the legal side and

702
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,790
this is facetious obviously the first

703
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,530
thing to do is we're gonna kill all the

704
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,750
lawyers there is quite a bit of

705
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:11,450
uncertainty in the legal community right

706
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,070
now around how to share data what data

707
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,780
is available to share do I want to share

708
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,939
data is it a good thing to share data

709
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,990
what's our exposure for for sharing data

710
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,940
if say for instance a domain name has an

711
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,770
IP address in the domain name is that

712
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,770
personal information can that be shared

713
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:29,600
I don't know talk to five lawyers you're

714
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:34,760
gonna get six different opinions and

715
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,379
then on the business side companies are

716
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,879
understaffed right now that's the whole

717
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,860
reason why this conference exists in a

718
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,680
sense is to get people into the industry

719
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,240
and so we've got processes that were

720
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,500
established a long time ago in order to

721
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,750
be able to get data in and out of

722
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,980
systems and they're very reluctant to be

723
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,110
able to go in and change these things

724
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,940
because they don't have the staff to one

725
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,919
make the change monitor the changes

726
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,350
release the changes and then take care

727
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,210
of it afterwards so people are companies

728
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:02,570
and businesses are somewhat reluctant to

729
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,150
be adding new new new changes to their

730
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:07,010
existing business processes in the

731
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,950
States we have a small animal

732
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:12,800
mmm about the size of a squirrel maybe

733
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:14,240
lives underground and it pops out every

734
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,580
once in a while it comes up out of its

735
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,350
burrow and pops up and looks around and

736
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,510
then it grabs whatever nut so that's

737
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:22,129
right back down into its hole and I use

738
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,420
this term to describe some of the action

739
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,830
that we see from companies that are just

740
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,810
interested in consuming the data

741
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,040
companies will pop up they'll grab all

742
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,419
the data and then they'll go back down

743
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,920
in their hole and we don't really see

744
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,300
them again for a while what we're

745
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,750
interested in having is people sharing

746
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:39,110
data and the prairie-dogging doesn't

747
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,460
help us move in that direction a lot of

748
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,840
companies don't know that they can share

749
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,430
data with us or that they should be

750
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,340
sharing data with us or why it is that

751
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:48,110
that's a good thing to be able to do and

752
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,280
as I mentioned that a lot of companies

753
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,840
are understaffed right now there's just

754
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:56,720
not a lot of development cycles in order

755
00:29:50,840 --> 00:30:00,980
to be able to building tools you're up

756
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,420
yeah thanks Mike just in closing to

757
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,900
cover a couple of quick points on how to

758
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,980
get involved with aPWG

759
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,690
so there's there's generally two main

760
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:12,680
areas here when we look at our

761
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:15,530
researchers and and the universities so

762
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:17,180
as a University researcher you want to

763
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,639
get your stuff published we can help you

764
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,790
do that you know like I said we do

765
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,320
publish these papers to the I Triple E

766
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,000
there's very few places that you really

767
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,860
want to get published as a researcher

768
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,890
but that's one of them

769
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:34,850
and we do offer special membership for

770
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:36,890
research organizations so aPWG is a

771
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:40,040
nonprofit organization everything we get

772
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:41,720
goes back into the community so and

773
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,930
that's where we maintain a membership

774
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,760
program so all of our corporate entities

775
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,430
we ask them to pay an annual membership

776
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,520
fee we use that money to keep the lights

777
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:55,220
on keep the systems up and running keep

778
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,379
our developers paid you know although we

779
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,330
try to think of ourselves as we're doing

780
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,550
the good fight we still have to pay our

781
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:04,159
bills so we kind of depend on those

782
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:06,260
groups to keep that money coming in we

783
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,910
get some grant money through the e trip

784
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,090
through the EU and some other

785
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:12,140
organizations but it's a small portion

786
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,730
of what it takes to keep the

787
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:17,930
organization as a whole up and running

788
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:20,900
but generally as a university if you

789
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:24,110
want to get access you just need to

790
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,960
a short abstract on what type of

791
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:28,490
researcher doing what other researchers

792
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,990
are you're working with and what

793
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,660
corporate entities you may be working

794
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,460
with and then we do have a data sharing

795
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:38,120
agreement everybody signs the same

796
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:40,340
agreement for the corporation side we do

797
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,350
have different levels depending on what

798
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,260
kind of data how you want to work with

799
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,990
the system the sponsoring level is for

800
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:50,720
full access then we have other levels

801
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,730
like a lot of the banking institutions

802
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,350
and and some of the other entities they

803
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:55,850
don't necessarily want the data they're

804
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,500
already working with somebody that has

805
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,480
access they just want to help keep the

806
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,240
group running so we have less or you

807
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,250
know a lower level for them to join and

808
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,200
we have an introductory you know if

809
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,610
you're an organization and you want to

810
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,290
play with the data a little bit to see

811
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,510
is this something I can use is it going

812
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:14,780
to help my company we do a 10-day trial

813
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:15,800
so you can sign up and get access and

814
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:19,850
get in there and play around a little

815
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:21,889
bit the emails are right there for me

816
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,709
Mike and support if you have questions

817
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:25,240
about the he crime exchange itself drop

818
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,770
us a note

819
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,960
we'll get you involved and see how we

820
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,850
can work together and like you say you

821
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,790
know our ultimate goal is try to make it

822
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,620
a safer place out there and see how we

823
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,790
can get this threat data and help our

824
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,120
researchers to get out there and

825
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:44,030
hopefully save people from losing their

826
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,199
money in the end of the day and I think

827
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,120
that's got it for us if there's any

828
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,120
questions we're here thank you very much

829
00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:00,779
I think you

830
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,879
you
