value of your team good morning everyone

169
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,600
it is nice to see that so many people

170
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,670
are interested in cybersecurity

171
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,010
it is nice to see our competitors

172
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:18,660
finally face to face I hope you'll have

173
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:21,420
a nice experience who is our team our

174
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,360

176
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:32,310
million well that's that's a number of

177
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:35,189
people we have in our country this is

178
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:37,680
the second year for us last year well we

179
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,310
did so so we hoped for better results

180
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,979
but we went back we reflected on it and

181
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:46,380
this year I think our team composition

182
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,810
is more well parents last year it was

183
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,000

184
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,650
this year we have pen testers well let's

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,700
just say we have red team we have blue

186
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:59,730
team we have everything we need and what

187
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:02,310
