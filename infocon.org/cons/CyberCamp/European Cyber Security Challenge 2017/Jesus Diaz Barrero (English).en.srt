1
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:17,900
our next guest he comes from Palo Alto

2
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:20,599
his name is Harris DF barretto he is a

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,598
pre sale system engineering manager for

4
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:26,360
Spain and Portugal with more than 20

5
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:29,060
years of experience on the security

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:32,720
space so please give a big and warm

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:37,820
applause - hi Suze DF barretto from Palo

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:39,410
Alto and the title is fighting malware

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,340
with the next-generation security

10
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,379
platform

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:47,780
hi Suze thank you for coming here people

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:49,370
hope we enjoy of your lecture and we see

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,410
you I see you like in about 45 minutes

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,300
that's right do you have any questions

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:59,078
or anything we see you with hisses later

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:01,459
thank you for Susan thank you thanks

17
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,630
hello guys good evening everyone

18
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:09,130
so yeah the the goal for the next 40 45

19
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:12,170
minutes it's to show you how a modern

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:15,050
security platform fights against reality

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,060
X we all Manuel so the goal of the

22
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,640
presentation will be like covering all

23
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,470
the basics of what we are doing on on a

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,390
real company so that you get the best

25
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,710
you are most of you are still studying

26
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,590
and I think that it's very interesting

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,479
for everyone here to understand how real

28
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,570
security is developed on a real company

29
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,510
so that's my goal for the I would say 20

30
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,580
25 minutes and then I know it's tough

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:39,320
time because after lunch you know I'm

32
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,120
Spaniard so typically we have siesta and

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,279
all that maybe you are sleeping I'm

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,500
trying my best so that you don't get

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,930
sleep so basically I'm gonna run some

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,270
real attacks I'm some small lab with

37
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,190
some VMs so that you can get a bit of

38
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,259
the a better idea what we are doing and

39
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,560
it's not just marketing as we

40
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,350
say in in the inner space ok after that

41
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,240
if we time permits I would be more happy

42
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,210
to answer any questions and by the way

43
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,850
my friend and colleague are caduceus

44
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,348
also with me we have a standard so very

45
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,810
happy to receive you there and answer

46
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:14,179
any questions that we cannot answer here

47
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:17,840
with that let's start with a with the

48
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,329
idea so basically the goal is to prevent

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,340
mal world and we delete then in order to

50
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:24,859
prevent malware we are we really love

51
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,340
the word prevent we believe the security

52
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:27,230
matter

53
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,450
so always work around prevention

54
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,640
detection is nice it's probably first

55
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,440
step but it cannot be only the end of

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,660
your journey if your journey ends on

57
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,209
detection then basically you are not

58
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,310
doing anything positive against the

59
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,660
issues so that's why we love prevention

60
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,610
everything that we do a palo alto

61
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,680
networks is around prevention so

62
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,590
basically in order to prevent modern

63
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,959
malware we live we need to work in three

64
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,180
main areas highly simplified so we need

65
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,310
to take care of the attack vectors also

66
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,620
about the delivery methods and finally

67
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,870
you need to think about how you can

68
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,810
block that's the end of the story

69
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,329
so very very basic information you

70
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,299
probably are aware about all these what

71
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:10,670
are the main attack vectors here we have

72
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,440
three of them so we have sploit probably

73
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,910
all of you know what our sploit tomorrow

74
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,459
you are gonna play probably enough about

75
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,230
exploits just in case someone is not

76
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,629
aware it's a small program that it's

77
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,970
going to try to use some kind of

78
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,340
vulnerability to make a program or

79
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,500
application work in a different way that

80
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,450
it was originally planned by the by the

81
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,150
author by the programmer there are many

82
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,768
many kind of difference Floyd's and of

83
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,230
course this is a way to deliver malware

84
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:38,120
it's my well always deliver VI exploits

85
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,399
no data every time that we have a spread

86
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,280
we have my word of course not but it's

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,109
it's clearly an attack vector another

88
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,530
one are macros they are gamed willpotter

89
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:51,530
up you know typically of huge documents

90
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,169
that embed some kind of executable

91
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,910
content and if you enable the macros you

92
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:58,430
can get off course the malware delivered

93
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:00,560
typically we have droppers or

94
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,930
downloaders families that are using this

95
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,180
kind of techniques and in many cases you

96
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,590
have executables and in this case you

97
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,239
are typically the attacker typical is

98
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,079
using social engineering and it's

99
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,060
working very well

100
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,849
for instance last year in Spain there

101
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,488
was a campaign where the attackers were

102
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:18,950
impersonating an electricity company and

103
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,779
they were sending a binary that was

104
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,180
supposed to be a PDF file telling you

105
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,250
hey you know what we have charged 800

106
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,050
zeros on your last bill for the

107
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,639
electricity if you don't agree please

108
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,039
open the document and you will find out

109
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,580
or what's the problem and many many

110
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,750
people were strict with this basic idea

111
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,990
even there were people that were strict

112
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,240
even if they they

113
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,070
not using this electricity company they

114
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,410
open the document because it's inside

115
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,390
the human being and of course if you if

116
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,580
you are able to execute the content you

117
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,340
are providing full rights to the malware

118
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,810
and it will execute so when it comes to

119
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,429
prevention and it comes to attack

120
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,600
doctors you need to take care of these

121
00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:00,090
three main vectors moving into the

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,250
delivery methods we can also in a very

123
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,219
simplified way talk about three we have

124
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,810
exploit kids and I'm sure that most of

125
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,220
you already know what it says poor kid

126
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,090
but just in case someone is not aware

127
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,250
very easy a juicer it's bit in a

128
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,169
compromised website if the website which

129
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,080
is compromised it's a highly reputable

130
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,850
it will probably work much better

131
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,349
because it has much higher probabilities

132
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,950
that the attacker does sorry that the

133
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:29,700
victim will click on it typically they

134
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:31,950
will do some hidden iframe probably one

135
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,750
by one pixels this sort of things that

136
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,210
are completely invisible for the human

137
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,510
eye and it's regulating in the

138
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:42,799
background the client to the malicious

139
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,300
code then when you reach to the exploit

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,490
spreadsheet web page typically what the

141
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,620
spreadsheets doing is try to make a

142
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,470
fingerprint trying to understand which

143
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,540
kind of device you are juicing your

144
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,710
super net why because depending on the

145
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,630
kind of device that you are juicing they

146
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,880
will inject a different kind of attack

147
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,850
so there are a lot of families around

148
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,530
spreadsheets probably aware about

149
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:06,510
neutrino angler and many others some of

150
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,030
them claim in the black market to have a

151
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,099
40 percent succeed rate which is huge if

152
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,080
you thin average forty percent four out

153
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,720
of ten devices that reach destroyed kids

154
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,280
are compromised okay after that of

155
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,930
course ones that you have the demoscene

156
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,429
compromised you can inject the malware

157
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,800
or do whatever you want so this is one

158
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,380
of the delivery methods another one it's

159
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,370
the email attachment nothing specific

160
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:31,290
here okay I attach my bill with trying

161
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,650
to impersonate the electricity company

162
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:37,560
and if you double click it you are done

163
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,570
so there is nothing there really to

164
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,370
invest a lot of time here there is a

165
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,969
macro whatever inside or even if it's an

166
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,190
attachment

167
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,230
it will run and the user will get

168
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,270
infected or maybe like in this example

169
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,389
you will get ransomware your

170
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,909
hardest or even then there will be

171
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:56,789
ciphered and everything and the

172
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,289
attackers will ask for ransom

173
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:01,300
last but not least we have the drive-by

174
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,280
downloads they are quite similar to the

175
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,560
sprockets many of you probably are aware

176
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,840
about them mainly basically a drive-by

177
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,660
download is a download but that is

178
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,630
driven by the attacker so what happens

179
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,150
in the behind the scenes is that the

180
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,669
user visits a compromised website again

181
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,039
the website it's serving some kind of

182
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:23,109
exploit without the user noticing what

183
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,330
is happening typically again it's very

184
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,020
useful and very popular using invisible

185
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,909
iframes

186
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,930
as I mentioned before also for desperate

187
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:34,030
kids this exploit is successful and if

188
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,500
it's successful it will download the

189
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,448
malware that will be installed

190
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,080
afterwards for those of you who are

191
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,550
familiar with Metasploit the typically

192
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,198
payload that you will load for lunch in

193
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,720
a drive-by download it's a download

194
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,069
exact when you to launch a download exit

195
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,690
you download the malware and then you

196
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:52,300
execute it so this is a typical drive-by

197
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,639
download ok you see this I guess that

198
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,650
most of you are already aware now it's

199
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,750
when it comes to the most difficult

200
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,669
question how we can block how we can

201
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,009
really prevent the Arats I told you

202
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,080
before that we are obsessed at Palo Alto

203
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,539
Networks about blocking everything that

204
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,419
we deliver it's planned for blocking for

205
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:12,699
preventing so you need to control of

206
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:15,340
course multiple adult vectors and also

207
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,900
the delivery methods and the challenge

208
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,840
today is that you need to do it at the

209
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,229
perimeter which is ok but the problem is

210
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,359
that the users are really mobile

211
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:27,340
nowadays so many times the perimeter is

212
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,560
not enough because the perimeter is not

213
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,950
even defined it's not clearly defined so

214
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:34,419
we have SAS I'm going to do some some

215
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,860
examples later use in a SAS application

216
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:37,240
and of course we need to take care of

217
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,430
the endpoints because the endpoints move

218
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,260
for instance today I mean outside the

219
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:43,208
office I'm here would you do in this

220
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,370
session and my my laptop needs still to

221
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,899
be protected so this is the challenge

222
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,690
for the companies that are working

223
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:55,060
trying to offer real protection to the

224
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:57,250
to the market so how do we once that we

225
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,989
have a clear view of how we see

226
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,950
landscape of the attacks how the

227
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:04,920
attackers move they deliver this

228
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,200
cetera how I can block very very

229
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,149
simplistic approach we are taking care

230
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,670
of three main steps that I will show

231
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,690
later hopefully in my in my demo if

232
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,899
everything works fine

233
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,089
first I'm Polly foremost we try to

234
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:20,730
reduce the attack surface this is

235
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,260
critical for us what do we mean

236
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:27,060
basically with reducing the attack

237
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:29,730
surface making this huge bullseye much

238
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,989
lower like in this example and how are

239
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,170
we doing this I will explain now but

240
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:37,380
just first cuts the idea when talking

241
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,290
about 100% security is stupid nowadays

242
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,079
if somebody able told you about 100%

243
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,399
security this guy is lying you for sure

244
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,540
so it's impossible but when we are

245
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,040
talking about reducing the attack

246
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,170
surface we are making much more

247
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,490
difficult for the attacker to be enabled

248
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,660
to attack us we have even measured this

249
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,970
what I mean showing you here on this

250
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:00,510
slide it's a very interesting study that

251
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,300
we run through a polymer Institute it's

252
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,740
an institute that is doing a lot of

253
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,319
studies about different aspects

254
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,410
typically related with computer science

255
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,930
and in this case it was hold just for

256
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:16,260
Europe and basically what we asked them

257
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,719
to do is make a broad interview of

258
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,480
European hackers trying to understand

259
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,570
how they behave so it was more kind of

260
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,060
or social aspect of the attackers and

261
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,769
what you see here here you have the full

262
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,750
report in case you're interested we will

263
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:32,820
share with everyone the slide so you can

264
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,459
afterwards tribute but what I want to

265
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,130
highlight here is when the attackers

266
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:41,010
quit when they decide that it's time to

267
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,290
move to another target because you're

268
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,810
your bullseye it's so small that for me

269
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:50,610
it's very difficult to make to make it

270
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:53,790
so after five hours 13% of the attacks

271
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:57,540
are deterred 10 hours 24 percent 20

272
00:10:53,790 --> 00:11:01,019
hours 36 percent of the attacks deter 40

273
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,540
hours less than two days 60 percent of

274
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,880
the attacks are litter this is not 100

275
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,649
percent of course never will be 100

276
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,199
percent but you can see is what we mean

277
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:11,600
with reducing the attack surface and

278
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:14,060
this is always has

279
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,470
in the DNA of the company this is what

280
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,018
we've been trying to do since the very

281
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,120
beginning how do we do that and here it

282
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:22,279
is when it comes to the platform so the

283
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,170
first team that we delivered was called

284
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,459
next-generation firewall is this piece

285
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,529
of image that you see here basically the

286
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:32,508
idea is it will process all the traffic

287
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,850
it will process all the traffic at layer

288
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:37,399
seven and is what the different guns and

289
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,829
it will be able to clearly understand

290
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,889
without any specific configuration from

291
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:44,870
the from the operator all the traffic no

292
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:46,639
matter which kind of ports it's running

293
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,920
and no matter what kind of configuration

294
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,680
you need to run on it so instead of

295
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,199
telling you this is IP address 1 1 1 1

296
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,689
going through pour 80 it will tell you

297
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:58,519
this is a session of web browsing or

298
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,440
this is a Facebook session or the recent

299
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,690
upload on Gmail or there is a download

300
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,730
on Gmail or somebody is posting it to it

301
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:08,120
that's the idea is the same way that we

302
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,310
talk today why farmers have been around

303
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,800
many many years ago in fact the protocol

304
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,569
which is most used nowadays on firewalls

305
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,329
which is called a stateful special it

306
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:20,509
was invented by checkpoint back in 99 -

307
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:23,810
most of you even maybe were not a still

308
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:26,839
born and the main idea behind that was

309
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:29,508
using ports and protocol back in 1992

310
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,399
that was good all the applications were

311
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:33,620
following an unwritten rule its

312
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,040
application has its own port perfect

313
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,420
that was good in 1982 what happens today

314
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,480
everybody knows we have suffered what we

315
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:44,420
call gravy station so most of the modern

316
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,120
apps are able to run on port 80 or port

317
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,939
443 so if my security device it's only

318
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,800
it's only learning about ports and

319
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:53,990
protocols I'm losing most of the

320
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,269
information so that's why we decided to

321
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,519
do something like a 7 and the core of

322
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:02,180
the solution it's called app ID you will

323
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,889
see in action in a few minutes ok what

324
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,229
does it mean it means that I'm not going

325
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:08,269
to allow any more port 80 or port 4 for

326
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,220
3 I'm going to allow only those

327
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,620
applications that I need to enable for

328
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,389
my business whatever it is if I am in a

329
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,339
university I will allow all the

330
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:19,939
applications required for instance 411

331
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:21,920
if I am in the business of Finance I

332
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:24,079
will allow only the applications that

333
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,490
are required for my for my finance

334
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,079
business and for me

335
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,390
my money transactions or whatever

336
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,370
probably most of them will run over poor

337
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,339
for for three but I'm not opening Paul

338
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:37,100
for for three anymore I'm just running

339
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:39,950
the required applications the next step

340
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,810
is adding the user component what we

341
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,360
call juice ready what does this mean

342
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,560
this means that nowadays users as I

343
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,240
mentioned before are mobile

344
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,949
you cannot trust anymore just the IP

345
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,290
address because my IP address will

346
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,209
change very frequently that's it so for

347
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,510
instance now I'm here connect three via

348
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:58,399
4G if I go back to the timaeus tan and

349
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,589
maybe I have a Wi-Fi or maybe a half a

350
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,399
cable connection but all this time I am

351
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,680
still conscious

352
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,510
I'm can zhuzh has some rights inside

353
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,760
this company so what usually ID is

354
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:11,270
trying to do is first of all make a

355
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,220
mapping of juicer equals IP address for

356
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,020
several IP addresses because maybe I

357
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,180
have different devices like now I have

358
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,370
my boil from here and I have also my

359
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,979
laptop so I have at least two IP

360
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,320
addresses and it will also try to learn

361
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,600
which role I have inside the company and

362
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,149
for that we typically integrate with

363
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,390
LDAP servers so first thing we are going

364
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:34,459
to try to map IP address to users I will

365
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,279
show you and then we will try to map

366
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:39,020
user to roll so now we are trying to

367
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,970
understand if I am a pre sales engineer

368
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,689
or if I am working at the development of

369
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:47,420
young I am a threat researcher because

370
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:50,690
they write that the system should gave

371
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,599
me are completely different hopefully

372
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:59,300
you get the idea just by doing these two

373
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:02,089
things we get a 60% surface reduction of

374
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,790
the ball side of my child at 60%

375
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,220
I'm not allowing any more for a deport

376
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,990
four to three on port 25 I'm allowing

377
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,600
the real applications there is a lot of

378
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,060
malware that is trying to hide inside

379
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,800
well-known ports I'm using port 443

380
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,420
outside because typically it's going to

381
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,430
be open and because typically it's going

382
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:23,060
to be open and it's SSL nobody will

383
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,989
unencrypted and then I can just go no

384
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,270
way no more

385
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:29,120
we will only allow a real application

386
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,949
for instance YouTube which is SSL but it

387
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,279
has to be to tube and only for the real

388
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:37,600
juicer that is behind this application

389
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,640
that has the required right

390
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,220
okay that was the first step in order to

391
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:46,449
prevent to really prevent attack second

392
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:48,220
step is how we can stop what we already

393
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,080
know that is bad and this is what we

394
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,670
basically do in the second step we are

395
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,410
going to try to prevent the non threats

396
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:56,530
preventing non threats

397
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:58,630
means talking about URL filtering and

398
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:02,079
well I don't want to allow maybe porn or

399
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:04,870
web pages or malware web pages I it

400
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,330
means doing IPs ideas it means doing

401
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,060
anti-malware antivirus it means doing

402
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,820
file blocking does it base any sense

403
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,510
that at my company everyone is capable

404
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:19,120
of downloading an executable fun

405
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:20,770
probably not we have departments where

406
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,110
we have engineers that are taking care

407
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,060
of the platforms and are doing the

408
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,950
software installation so why everybody

409
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,569
at my company needs to download an

410
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,670
executable file it doesn't make any

411
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:33,220
sense so we can control that and of

412
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:36,310
course talking also about DNS command

413
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,950
control traffic etc etc what we are

414
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:41,199
doing here it's basically feeding this

415
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:44,140
platform with everything that we learn

416
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,750
constantly that is known as malicious

417
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,060
and we inject it in form of signatures

418
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,860
and the main difference why it's working

419
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,839
that well is because it's taken into

420
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,080
consideration the application and the

421
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,530
juicer as a context so you will see in

422
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,900
the demo as a administrator I just need

423
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,970
to configure a basic policy saying I

424
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,760
want to enable everything all put please

425
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,459
put all my security on when we when we

426
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,849
create the company we decided to create

427
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:14,320
a very specific way of analyzing packets

428
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:16,389
which is called single pal Perales

429
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,829
processing that allows us to enable

430
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,160
everything without performance

431
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,510
degradation okay I know that it sounds

432
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,550
very optimistic but this is the way it

433
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,650
works if I have time later I can explain

434
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,720
you how it works so basically you enable

435
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,580
everything now the problem is okay good

436
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,780
you never all your security but I am

437
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,330
really worried about the service

438
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,639
typically the service usually supersedes

439
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,620
the security unfortunately this how it

440
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,300
works I'm working here because my

441
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,820
service needs to be up if the service is

442
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,649
not up I don't care about security so I

443
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,990
am worried about false positives and

444
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,300
this is where context comes in place

445
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,350
basically contest means you enable

446
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,600
everything and the device automatic

447
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,789
Kelly it's able to detect okay this is a

448
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
Facebook session so from all this

449
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:59,840
security

450
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,289
I will pick up only those prevention

451
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,320
mechanism that are relevant to Facebook

452
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:08,600
next session is FTP okay from all this

453
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,580
mechanism I will extract only because I

454
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,590
have this context only those that are

455
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,720
relevant to FTP probably you agree with

456
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,000
me that making Facebook security of our

457
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,789
FTP makes no sense so this is what the

458
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,030
device makes automatically for you so

459
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:25,010
this is basically what we doing up to

460
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:27,649
2011 and we were quite happy problem is

461
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:31,150
that the attackers are really smart and

462
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:34,880
they realized that it was possible to

463
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:36,980
modify very easily the the the malware

464
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,080
or the attacks themselves using

465
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,600
something called polymorphism which I'm

466
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,879
sure every one of you are aware about it

467
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,459
and it was used many many years ago but

468
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,669
it we saw like a really reintroduction

469
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,830
of polymorphism back in 2010-2011

470
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:53,630
basically the idea is I can use some

471
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,600
kind of automation I will show you later

472
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:59,179
as well making a slight modification of

473
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:03,740
my malware and maybe like an evil I am

474
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:05,870
able to bypass this system so the third

475
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,820
step is how I prevent unknown threats

476
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,668
because now this unknown to me I know I

477
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,678
never saw it before and for this what we

478
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:14,809
decided to do and this was also unique

479
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,780
in the market by that time at the end of

480
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:20,030
2011 we decided to add a sandbox into

481
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,918
the game if I have time I will show you

482
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,720
as well later and what is the sandbox

483
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,020
doing the sandbox is taking care of

484
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,309
everything that is going here so I

485
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,590
identified application is it the correct

486
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:33,230
one yes or no I identify the user is it

487
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:36,289
the current one is it if does it have

488
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,990
the they require rights I inspect the

489
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:42,049
content is it clean or is it is it dirty

490
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:44,840
if it's dirty I block it and if it's not

491
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:47,690
dirty then there are two options first

492
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,699
option and the desirable one it's clean

493
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,590
and I should allow it but the second

494
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,929
option which is not done nice this is an

495
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:57,439
unknown threat to me I never saw it

496
00:19:53,929 --> 00:20:00,950
before so instead of allowing it I have

497
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,059
to upload it to my sandbox and I told

498
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,750
you from the very beginning we love

499
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:04,639
prevention

500
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,910
I'm not going just to tell you after 5

501
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,700
min

502
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,860
if it's good or if it's bad I'm going to

503
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,800
create automatically signatures on the

504
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:16,879
fly and I will inject all the signatures

505
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:23,060
to all the devices worldwide this sample

506
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:25,550
has has got that many importance is such

507
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,679
big that now it has become the best way

508
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,620
for us to deliver new protection

509
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,900
mechanism we have even arranged

510
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,149
agreements with competitors to share

511
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,860
malware and what we do with the malware

512
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,810
that the competitors share with us we

513
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,300
inject it also here in order to create

514
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,520
intelligence so all of our intelligence

515
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,399
from now right now is around welfare

516
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,800
which of course can be a public sandbox

517
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,390
or a private on-premise one for those

518
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,730
customers who are concerned about

519
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:57,110
sending sensitive information outside

520
00:20:52,730 --> 00:21:02,210
the perimeter okay so but this was like

521
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:04,280
the second high innovative milestone in

522
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,990
the in the history of the company third

523
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,639
one is we need to take care of the

524
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,170
endpoint and we are talking about

525
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,720
endpoint we are talking maybe about

526
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,550
traffic which is safer and I'm I'm not

527
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,500
answering here so I can not see it or

528
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,090
maybe I'm talking about a sensitive

529
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,950
document that I haven't inspected before

530
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,770
or maybe I'm checking out an endpoint

531
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,270
which is out of the office and all the

532
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,780
traffic that is moving is not going here

533
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:29,020
so basically for that reason we develop

534
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,399
a solution which is called traps which

535
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,760
basically tries to do two things

536
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,280
it tries to prevent zero-day exploits

537
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:41,930
and it tried to prevent unknown attacks

538
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,370
and on my work how does it work I was

539
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,140
discussing this before with some of you

540
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,239
outside understand I don't have a lot of

541
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,460
time but very quickly for the sprites

542
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,440
part if it's an announced ployed if it's

543
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,900
a zero day it's erroneous of course also

544
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,970
for us so what we are doing you know

545
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,060
that nowadays in order for an attacker

546
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:00,730
to exploit a vulnerability they need to

547
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,020
utilize a lot of different techniques

548
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,880
thanks to God the modern operating

549
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,980
systems have put in place a lot of

550
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,750
countermeasures to make the life of the

551
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,590
attackers more complex you know

552
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,690
Asli DP protection of the dll's such

553
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:16,399
this kind of stuff so the attacker once

554
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,500
the big farms a vulnerability and wants

555
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,390
to exploit it need to use

556
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,280
some techniques we don't know the

557
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,140
vulnerability and we never saw this ploy

558
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,210
before but we know the techniques so

559
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,650
what are we doing here we are trying to

560
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,750
detect utilization of the techniques

561
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,850
maybe it's trying to use a hip spray

562
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,980
prolly you know about it or maybe it's

563
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,870
trying to search a rope chain for

564
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,460
building a rope some rub gadgets

565
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,120
forbidden a rope chain and execute some

566
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,220
code etc this is what we are doing here

567
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,439
okay and of course for the magwell part

568
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,720
it's also connected with Wi-Fi so every

569
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,810
time we try to execute something here we

570
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,660
can ask malware to wildfire do you know

571
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:56,990
if it's malware even it has a local

572
00:22:53,660 --> 00:23:00,530
analysis motor and gene which is based

573
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,960
upon machine learning and it's able to

574
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:05,210
detect variants of existing malware

575
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,330
without connection to the cloud which is

576
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:10,310
also pre amazing I will show you now so

577
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,850
this is basically the idea of security

578
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:16,190
platform for parallel to networks there

579
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,969
is one last step one last thing which is

580
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,120
really critical

581
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,680
it's SSL decryption if you are not

582
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,239
thinking about SSL decryption you are

583
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,220
called giovanna file in many cases

584
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,920
specifically when you are talking about

585
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:31,550
the network why because as you know

586
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,740
Brown today roughly 50 percent of all

587
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,659
the traffic is encrypted and everything

588
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,480
that you can not unencrypted or you

589
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,550
cannot see you cannot protect so if you

590
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,620
don't unencrypted traffic your only

591
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:46,310
chance is working on the endpoint okay

592
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:49,939
and yeah this is all about this is how

593
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:52,550
we reconstruct it very quickly in 20 25

594
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,430
minutes the message of Palo Alto

595
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:58,870
Networks and as I promised this is the

596
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:01,010
platform with a nicer drawing that these

597
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,659
handwriting so we have the firewall we

598
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,180
have the threat cloud intelligence cloud

599
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,570
and we have also the endpoint solution

600
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,040
and now as as promised I wanna show you

601
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,800
all the solution working so that this is

602
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,850
not just a slide so let's see if this

603
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,340
works I hope so

604
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,860
so what I have here I have several

605
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,560
themes one of those VMs

606
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:25,040
it's a firewall it's a VM firewall ok

607
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,840
and we're going to start with something

608
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,730
very basic I'm gonna try to show you how

609
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,949
we can talk about reducing the attack

610
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,600
surface so for that first thing I'm

611
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,030
gonna do I'm gonna try to bypass

612
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,889
my firewall I'm gonna what i what i'm

613
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,830
gonna do i'm going to configure my

614
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:42,530
firewall as a layer 4 device one of

615
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:45,620
these all firewalls which are still

616
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:50,950
highly utilized in the real market where

617
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,949
i want to enable only this policy look I

618
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:57,920
have called my policy only HTTP and see

619
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,140
I have the devices computer larger three

620
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,320
so it has basically using the VMware

621
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,360
bridge network it has two networks one

622
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,250
which I call trust another one which I

623
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,080
call and trust and the firewall is doing

624
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,030
the routing between both of them and I

625
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:15,889
am allowing everything that goes from

626
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:18,050
trust to entrust using service HTTP

627
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,710
which in Palo Alto network means port 80

628
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:23,300
okay

629
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:26,390
is it easy so chip and then I have I'm

630
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,980
going to disable this rule and then I

631
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,720
have the typical deny all everything

632
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:33,530
else will be denied okay

633
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,780
very easy I'm going to commit all my

634
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:38,540
changes and now what I'm going to

635
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,070
simulate I'm going to try to bypass my

636
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,020
firewall I'm gonna bypass my firewall

637
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,970
I'm going to inject traffic that is

638
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,100
going to travel through port 80 but is

639
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,510
not in reality web browsing for that

640
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,580
purpose I'm going to use net cut I'm

641
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,980
sure that all of you are completely

642
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:58,689
familiarize with net cut so let's try to

643
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:58,690
do that so here in the Mac

644
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,620
I have net cut I will put it on the top

645
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,810
of the screen so everybody can see it

646
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,209
I have net net cut running on poor Eddie

647
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:14,240
this is on the untrust side of the of

648
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:19,130
the communication and now I have a

649
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,470
Windows 7 which has net cut installed as

650
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,180
well simulating for instance that this

651
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:25,850
machine has been compromised and you

652
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:27,770
know that via net cut you can include a

653
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,020
cell so what I'm going to do now I'm

654
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:34,520
gonna inject a cell through port 80 okay

655
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,330
you see the same yes so net cut Mews I'm

656
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,950
sorry guys

657
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:40,790
because with the definition you cannot

658
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:44,960
see Minos ECM d dot X against my untrust

659
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:47,480
IP simulating web traffic is this web

660
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,890
browsing or is not web browsing what do

661
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:55,340
you think is not but look what happens

662
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:59,900
if I go to my Mac yes I got the

663
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:01,909
connection the version format no format

664
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,000
not okay

665
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:07,040
why if my firewall is so smart if I

666
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,900
promise you from the very beginning that

667
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:11,540
we are so smart why I have been able to

668
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:14,210
bypass it because I'm just using another

669
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,260
four port this is the real problem and

670
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,990
this is what we are talking about

671
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:20,480
reducing the attack surface if we take a

672
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:23,030
look a quick look to the logs we will

673
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,790
find something interesting let's filter

674
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:32,180
on port 80 so that you can get a better

675
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:34,610
view of what I mean Here I am ok so I

676
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,190
have this session from trust to and

677
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:41,780
Trust through poor Eddie it's allowed by

678
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:44,930
look it's a smart is it web browsing no

679
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,389
it's a noun TCP and even it's taking a

680
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,550
capture a pick up so that you can

681
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,870
further later analyze what kind of

682
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,700
traffic is going here because this is a

683
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,439
noun it is not really web browsing

684
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,500
I have follow it because you have told

685
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,450
me to do so so what I mean with reducing

686
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,670
the attack surface what I need to do now

687
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:03,320
should an enable the IPS read enabled

688
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,590
URL filtering no not at all

689
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:10,189
just like f7 security okay let's do it

690
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:14,000
here in real real time very see now my

691
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:15,590
policy I will change and I will add the

692
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,710
application here

693
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:25,070
now I want to allow web browsing only

694
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:26,929
web browser only that here I have all

695
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,658
the profiles security profiles but I'm

696
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:34,070
not touching that I commit my changes

697
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:36,919
I'll look what happens can I put this

698
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,730
here on the top screen so that everybody

699
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:42,200
can see it

700
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:50,500
I repeat exactly the same operation it's

701
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:50,500
finishing yes it's done let's try again

702
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,990
and oops

703
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:01,279
this is the demo effect what do you

704
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:03,169
think no it's not look ice block wow

705
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,940
this is interesting what's happened

706
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:07,159
come on guys you are billion blade and

707
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:09,620
brains what do you think that has

708
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:11,059
happened how can the firewall know if

709
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,830
this is web browser or not web browser

710
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:14,809
what is the first thing that will happen

711
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,220
on a TCP connection three-way handshake

712
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:18,110
even the few a handshake

713
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,020
there is no ledger seven payload I have

714
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,270
no idea of if this is really web

715
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,639
browsing or not so I have to allow the

716
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:28,070
connection once that I start to see

717
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,990
larger seven traffic I can block it yes

718
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,500
hopefully it makes sense I'm running out

719
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:35,899
of time so I cannot dedicate much more

720
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,700
time now if we look at the at the

721
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,770
traffic it will see the same but now

722
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:40,640
look now is the nine because she's not

723
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,250
web browser anymore

724
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,309
no way PS no you are filtering this is

725
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:49,610
attack surface reduction okay let's move

726
00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:52,690
now into injecting a user into my

727
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:55,250
firewall so I'm going to use typically

728
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:59,510
everything from insight website disallow

729
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:02,000
with security profiles okay in order for

730
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,760
us to inject users we have different

731
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,399
methods we can learn them from a Active

732
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,010
Directory server or we can get them from

733
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:11,809
a captive portal and we also have an API

734
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:14,720
everything in Palo Alto Networks it's

735
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:16,730
open we have an API for injecting users

736
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,220
from the external world and this is what

737
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,630
I'm gonna use in this case we are the

738
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,630
API you can do whatever you want

739
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:27,590
including injecting users so angry and

740
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:29,450
yet this user is the format login entry

741
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:33,019
in Windows 7 this is

742
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:35,750
be always data table success of course

743
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:38,690
you can make a script to run this and at

744
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:43,760
this moment if I for instance

745
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:47,990
generate some traffic like a ping to

746
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:51,980
Google for instance and we filter the

747
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:56,059
logs I'm going to filter for instance by

748
00:30:51,980 --> 00:31:00,010
application ping we should start seeing

749
00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:02,899
the source user you sit here here we are

750
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,370
and now of course if I would have here

751
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:06,799
an adept server I could start

752
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:10,189
integrating this with my LDAP server and

753
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,990
learning which roles this win7 user has

754
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,909
it belongs to the administrative

755
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,799
department to the marketing department

756
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:20,000
it's a techie guy is not a typical etc

757
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:23,570
ok so in order to finish with my demo

758
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,940
and leave room to the next conference I

759
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:28,490
wanna show you how to work against

760
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,279
malware so for that purpose I'm going to

761
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,659
download some or to upload it doesn't

762
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,090
matter some samples that I have here

763
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:38,779
this is a box folder it's something

764
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:41,330
similar to Dropbox and of course if I

765
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:47,960
want to prevent attacks here what I have

766
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:49,699
to do first thing this is result if I

767
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,340
don't enable SSL decryption

768
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,950
I'm not going able to inspect this so

769
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,740
first of all I will check if I have SSL

770
00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:01,039
decryption enabled or not I'm going to

771
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:04,159
my policies decryption as you can see is

772
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,019
disabled I will enable it and what I'm

773
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,289
decrypting I'm decrypting all the

774
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:12,019
traffic from the layer 3 trust network

775
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:14,929
site to the untrust and only for the

776
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:17,360
online and storage and backup category

777
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:19,220
why because maybe my users aren't

778
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,219
concerned that I am decrypt in traffic

779
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,070
when they are going to a file a health

780
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,299
department or maybe to a financial

781
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,189
institute to check if they have been

782
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:30,918
paid with money or whatever so that's

783
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:35,659
why I'm only decrypting this traffic

784
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:37,190
so we commit the changes again very

785
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:38,480
quickly every time that we work with

786
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,309
parallel what you have a candidate

787
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,970
conflict and a running when you make the

788
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:44,639
commit you make the candidate

789
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:47,880
running okay so now it's running once

790
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,560
that it finishes core and now I can try

791
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,900
to see what happens if for instance I

792
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,810
take a well-known piece of malware like

793
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,420
this buried BLB bot which is a botnet

794
00:32:54,810 --> 00:33:05,610
from 2 or 3 years old if I try to upload

795
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:09,300
it uploading oops

796
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:12,479
failed why let's take a look to the logs

797
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:16,020
now I'm moving to the thread part and we

798
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,090
should receive in exactly you see this

799
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,410
is a wildfire by ryos look very

800
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,280
interesting port

801
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:25,680
it's 443 the attacker it's a Windows 7

802
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:28,560
which is uploading but the application

803
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,960
is not as a cell is box net why because

804
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:35,250
I am an encrypting on the trophy and I I

805
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,840
can now inspect it yes lastly I'm going

806
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,560
to try to make something different I'm

807
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,600
gonna try to create a mutation a

808
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:45,270
polymorphism variant of this VLB body

809
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,860
for that I'm going to use this tool it's

810
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:48,870
very easy it's just making a

811
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,729
modification on the header of the PE

812
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,879
file on the portable executable by

813
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,830
modifying the but by adding the

814
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,170
timestamp so every time Alex agreed I'm

815
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,149
creating a completely new variant of the

816
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:04,170
same malware ok so I can show you how we

817
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:13,139
behave against polymorphism look I have

818
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:16,950
here this variant and will mutate it

819
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:19,259
over this folder mutate it has done the

820
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:27,239
mutation if we take a look to the

821
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:29,910
mutated folder here we have it I didn't

822
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,939
want to show you this let's call it VL

823
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:35,310
be bought Malaga ok and you see the

824
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,340
house the original one and the new one

825
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:44,610
ok so now what happens if I try to

826
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:47,670
upload this here let's see it's a

827
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:53,180
completely new version that the attacker

828
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:53,180
has created if I try to upload it

829
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:01,470
it failed again why because the way and

830
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,840
here we should have a new entry why

831
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,189
because you see the new entry because

832
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,340
the way that we are developing

833
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:10,950
signatures is based upon the content and

834
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:13,290
not upon the house if my signatures that

835
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:16,169
just has base how many signatures I need

836
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,550
as many as far as files in this case is

837
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,720
based upon the continent upon the

838
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,750
payload this is really powerful

839
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,040
mechanism guys just to end with my

840
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,630
session let's take a look to the

841
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,390
endpoint I promise you also that I was

842
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:30,450
showing you so if I try to execute the

843
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:34,710
first variation of my malware of my

844
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:36,870
botnet traps will detect it this is the

845
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,970
endpoint agent installed if we take a

846
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:43,290
look to the details why this malware has

847
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:47,009
been detected look the reason it was

848
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:50,400
known to one fire yes god it is a very

849
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,900
old version so it's known now what

850
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,360
happens with the new version that I just

851
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,210
created let's try to run it BLB bot

852
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,130
malaga is the same content but inside

853
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,850
the different envelope so it looks like

854
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,370
new malware

855
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,990
if I run it what do you think this is

856
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,509
known to wildfire or the Sun now no of

857
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,759
course it's a noun it's been uploaded

858
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,610
now in parallel but it's unknown but if

859
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,970
I look at the details right now has been

860
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:17,370
again stopped in this case is because

861
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,270
the local analysis engine that I

862
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,609
mentioned before

863
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,320
remember the machine learning so this

864
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:25,140
clearly demonstrates that we are able

865
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,390
even to prevent polymorphic and non

866
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,120
attacks without connection thanks to the

867
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,770
different mechanism included into the

868
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,420
local analysis which basically is a

869
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,870
static analysis for those of you who are

870
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,580
aware about it and yeah with that I'm

871
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:40,350
done I hope that this was interesting

872
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,210
for you guys I don't know if we have

873
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:45,240
time for questions I'm not sure if we

874
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:47,250
really happen yes we have okay so my

875
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,919
pleasure if someone has any question if

876
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:57,240
not in the meantime I will I will close

877
00:36:49,920 --> 00:37:01,440
everything hello any questions on the

878
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:04,790
floor I'm sure there are some questions

879
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,790
no yes

880
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:16,020
one over there avian do you have any

881
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:21,000
Mike any microt creo que mató cara mia'

882
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:22,009
Bartel micro ah well you must wield

883
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,110
power

884
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:36,000
can you please take the microphone up to

885
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:38,100
the right yes there it is okay so this

886
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,440
is for you at the beginning you said

887
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:46,110
that you reach a sort of agreement for

888
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,920
the for sharing what you are detecting

889
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:53,340
oh so at the end my question is if you

890
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,440
are using some specific I don't know

891
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:59,130
standard the method for representing

892
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,480
what you are detecting in order to share

893
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:06,300
this information with competitors or

894
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,340
partners in order to speed up all the

895
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,960
processing phase when this information

896
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:15,300
are received for example and I mean my

897
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,790
question is if you are using a pencil

898
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,750
solution or well-known cert standards or

899
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:23,430
if you are using I mean private

900
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:26,310
solutions for representing this kind of

901
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:30,029
information okay so it's a very in

902
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:32,460
question basically the project that we

903
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:34,110
created for this purpose it's called CTA

904
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,720
in case you are interested to take a

905
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:39,480
look it means cyber threat Alliance it

906
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,660
was founded originally in back in 2013

907
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,910
by a fortunate McAfee Symantec and Palo

908
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,580
Alto Networks and now I had spread to

909
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:50,250
many many other vendors and it has

910
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,040
evolved over the time so the way the

911
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:55,170
tool that we are using for measuring

912
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,990
what it's it's member has to upload

913
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,190
because everyone is forced to upload new

914
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,810
information every day because we are

915
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,540
competitors so we want to be sure that

916
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:05,700
all of us are collaborating it's a virus

917
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,560
total so you have to upload at least

918
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,509
1000 new samples per day that are

919
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,190
unknown to virus total for instance

920
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,860
that's one of the metrics there are many

921
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:16,530
others and regarding the the way that we

922
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,270
are sharing information yes we are using

923
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:20,150
standard

924
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:24,020
mechanism right now we are using sticks

925
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:26,330
taxi and some of the some of the members

926
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,580
are proposing moving into Miss I don't

927
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:32,480
have a lot of details around that but

928
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,920
because they are private but is this how

929
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,980
it works so yes we are using a standard

930
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,710
even we are we are creating papers what

931
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,060
with what we found once that we analyze

932
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,880
all the information that all the members

933
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,310
are collaborating with that's what the

934
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,790
convention of what you are detecting

935
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:52,009
what you are detective is done it's

936
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,720
automatically done in one file okay say

937
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:57,530
it sort of needs and it's done automated

938
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:59,689
way okay so every time I receive

939
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:02,480
something for instance that it's coming

940
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:04,640
from semantic I'm inject that into alpha

941
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,530
so my engine is able to detect if it's

942
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,180
really malware or not according to our

943
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:09,560
rules and if it's malware it's

944
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,000
generating the same kind of signatures

945
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,640
that I've shown you here and it's

946
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,710
sharing all this information to all the

947
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,930
subscriber into Palo Alto Networks it

948
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,180
doesn't matter if endpoint network or

949
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,259
both

950
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:24,109
thank you very much thank you for the

951
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:27,530
question thank you we have another

952
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:30,760
question hey suppose sure not too

953
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,760
difficult please or the words have a run

954
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:46,850
what kind of operation you are doing on

955
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:50,089
this kind of cyber information theater

956
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,860
for example like are you doing when when

957
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:54,560
you are sharing this information cyber

958
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:57,680
threat information with other company so

959
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,590
you are doing some kind of operation on

960
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,930
this information so can the mic can you

961
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:06,490
give us example of what kind of

962
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:12,259
operation you are doing when this data

963
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:14,180
ok so yes in fact we have another

964
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,190
solution around all this threat

965
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,020
intelligence cloud which I didn't have

966
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,240
that time today to present but which is

967
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,610
called autofocus and basically this is a

968
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,529
huge big data system which basically

969
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:27,230
what is doing its with every time that

970
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:29,780
we find a new malware sample we resected

971
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,540
into world we come what we call

972
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,670
artifacts

973
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,590
what is an artifact an artifact it's any

974
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,600
kind of behavior that a malware sample

975
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:39,420
has for instance let me give you some

976
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:42,330
examples it's creating a temporal file

977
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:46,140
on the temporal folder or it's modifying

978
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:47,730
this registry or it's doing some kind of

979
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,650
modification on the hard disk or

980
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:52,020
whatever and we are able to cross all

981
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,840
this information correlated all around

982
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,850
the big data system and cross it in

983
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,790
order to create or facilitate the

984
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:01,890
operations of the sake teams so you can

985
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:03,830
