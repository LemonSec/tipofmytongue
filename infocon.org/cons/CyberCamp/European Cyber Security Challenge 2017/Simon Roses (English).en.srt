1
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,770
okay

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:21,570
there we go all set hello everybody it's

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,710
a little nice to be here I guess I'm

4
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,210
only speaking English because it asked

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,579
me to do it so that's fine with me

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,860
so therefore this talk is about how to

7
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,668
analyze source code to look for open

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,890
source intelligence

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,629
so you are more like pen testing doing

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,130
pen testing or recon or producing

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,620
diligence hopefully you will find this

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,930
talk interesting if not if you are not

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,538
into this target hopefully you will find

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,129
this tracker as well interesting so

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,469
let's let's move on because I think we

16
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,940
are a bit we are a bat in time so I

17
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,219
guess I will move forward okay my name

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,620
is Sam neurosis I usually go to a

19
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,070
conference and in Syria has invited here

20
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,530
to to speak so thanks really appreciate

21
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,630
it usually I go to different conference

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,420
and talk on different and subjects and

23
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,929
usually I wanna throw to to the US DARPA

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,420
to the Pentagon to talk about one of our

25
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,310
technology we develop here in Spain so

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,280
that was quite interesting being a

27
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,080
foreigner really interesting experience

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,150
and where we are bullying it is a small

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,259
start-up here in Spain that usually

30
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,850
terrify a lot to Europe us and i AC are

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,900
doing a pen testing and different type

32
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:37,199
of work so they are ejected for the talk

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,900
it will be some basic very basic source

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,730
code analysis and mostly we are more

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,120
interesting is how to apply open source

36
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,200
intelligence techniques into source code

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,540
usually you saw when we talk about

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,390
operators telling you people go to the

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,340
search engines to their social networks

40
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,340
of course we will do that as well

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,770
but the idea with this is we go

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,270
before that we go to the source code

43
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,100
because we can find some real

44
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,100
interesting piece of information there

45
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,649
so we will call a battalion general I

46
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,200
what we're talking here what we're

47
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,890
looking for then we will talk about what

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,780
what are we targeting and in operative

49
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,899
intelligence or tent and then we'll

50
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,360
Google the ocean conclusions about this

51
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:28,550
work keep in mind this

52
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,560
working progress and I have not been

53
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,599
seen there are some people starting to

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,550
talk about this subject actually I went

55
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:36,349
to DEFCON and I was talking about this

56
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,090
and there were some more people talking

57
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,950
about it but still it's fine you feel

58
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,319
there's no much research have been done

59
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,760
so you guys want to go into this subject

60
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,220
it's a lot of things to do it to be done

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,200
so that's that's really awesome so yeah

62
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,270
this is a work in progress I will give

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,940
you some ideas on hopefully people you

64
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,450
will enter into this you can work on

65
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:02,840
your own so yeah working progress keep

66
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:05,089
this in mind interaction so this is like

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,560
a framework one of the many of the

68
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,080
frameworks different framework for pen

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,090
testing that one is from the PDS the

70
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,780
penetration testing education standard

71
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,010
quite common so yeah we have all the

72
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,470
different interfaces right a

73
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,870
pre-engagement intelligence-gathering

74
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,060
fear modeling bullet ESS analysis

75
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,940
exploitation post exploitation and

76
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,100
reporting usually a fantastic we hate

77
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,450
reporting so usually we try to skip that

78
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,820
but we have to do that we have to give

79
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,640
something to the customers but here in

80
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,739
my a my for example I like to spend a

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,779
lot of time in reckon and

82
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,420
intelligence-gathering bullet the

83
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,370
analysis and post-petition user list

84
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,768
predation is fun to write an expert but

85
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,750
yes you yes should launch the exploit

86
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,340
and you get access but precipitations

87
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,450
really funny as well but today I'm not

88
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,880
going to talk about too much

89
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:58,839
versus petition so I will focus mostly

90
00:03:52,880 --> 00:04:01,160
in intelligence gathering so target

91
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,400
developers I'm sure many of you will

92
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,079
recognize student partner former

93
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,150
Microsoft CEO and he was talking about

94
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,859
the Belapur in case of Microsoft of

95
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,480
course they want to know the most

96
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,150
interesting the most important thing

97
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,230
besides the source code but actually I

98
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,750
would say even the people is more

99
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:20,298
important or the first abuts to

100
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,839
developers is very and many many

101
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:22,760
companies

102
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,179
microservices a technology company right

103
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,800
stuff for company but even even even in

104
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,560
other companies that they are not

105
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,270
technology focus developers are starting

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,520
to get a lot of attention

107
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,340
many for example many filters aren't a

108
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,960
financial companies developers

109
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,020
all science people are getting more

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,150
important than than financial people so

111
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,890
the same that developers so you know

112
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,719
target here what we're looking where we

113
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,010
are doing here right now instead for

114
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,540
example I have to do a pen testing in

115
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,539
our company I will interrogate

116
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:59,050
developers and that's the approach I'm

117
00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:02,960
I'm following here why because usually

118
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:05,660
developers are technical people as us of

119
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,390
course but usually they are not security

120
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:11,510
savvy meaning they usually are not that

121
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,159
familiar with security feature security

122
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,500
and all that stuff so that's that's

123
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,950
perfect for us unless they are there are

124
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,740
very influencers they can influence the

125
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,659
higher management the talk the level

126
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,270
management to hire to buy the technology

127
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,920
or make some tire go for this company so

128
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,590
usually they have they have a lot of

129
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,050
they can influence the management so

130
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,239
that's perfect so that's a standard to

131
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,850
target them usually they have also

132
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,320
access to many critical systems or

133
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,060
information and systems because they are

134
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,110
the developers have they have to get

135
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,210
access to the systems from the data and

136
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:50,000
then after my upon interested point of

137
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,820
view when we are doing this when we are

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,750
targeting the developers there are

139
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,010
things we can exploit and we love that

140
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,860
one of the first things we can explain

141
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,230
science fiction well the chances chances

142
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,090
are developers we love and even not

143
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,770
necessary developers but most of the

144
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,630
other betters I know they do love

145
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,510
science fiction that's something we can

146
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:14,090
think about it of course there are so

147
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:19,310
many of them like anime Japanese say

148
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:21,260
cartoons course porn internet is for

149
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,400
porn right so there's something we can

150
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:27,349
target and of course bigger so there are

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,090
different things subjects we can explore

152
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,370
again and we are looking for all these

153
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,929
intelligence a lot our company that's

154
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,200
something we have to keep in mind that's

155
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:41,090
something we stopped we can we can use

156
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:43,520
to get access to systems the matter is

157
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,159
we are following is quite simple its

158
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,520
first of course this only works with

159
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,889
companies that has a public report we

160
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,359
are if we are

161
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,580
from the outside we can also do this

162
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,639
internally by bus we'll talk a bit about

163
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,258
that but usually is this work would

164
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,879
combining the hash report but the good

165
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,039
thing is more and more companies today

166
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,169
there are they embrace open source

167
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,949
software so the many companies are

168
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:10,568
putting your open reports other so

169
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:13,689
that's that's Lou Perez we can we can

170
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:16,360
analyze that many companies do that for

171
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:18,219
magazine many of them do for marketing

172
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,569
purposes or they want to share with the

173
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:22,120
community perfect

174
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,310
we don't care why but as long they do

175
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,529
that's perfect

176
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,659
so first thing identify the color report

177
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:30,969
we can target an organization we can

178
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:32,560
take an individual like a developer for

179
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:35,430
example then we can do different

180
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,680
searches on the source code looking for

181
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,449
opportunities and then of course we have

182
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,979
all that data and now we can go to the

183
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:49,240
social networks and do all the things we

184
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:52,599
usually do code repositories we have a

185
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,240
bunch of different reports we can go

186
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:57,550
right now right we have a github so what

187
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,589
is right now is I think it's a one of

188
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,169
the best or the top I will say right now

189
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,639
in publish reports right pretty much all

190
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:06,729
the companies or many companies and

191
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,189
Alicia fara public reporter we can go

192
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:10,960
there and check out what half publish so

193
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:13,899
a good hub will be one of the top places

194
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,060
I will go a big package salt for Kali

195
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,710
pigs for Microsoft Google code from

196
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,240
Google of course so there's a bunch of

197
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,979
different and there many more actually

198
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,620
those are there yes one of the tops a

199
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,899
core reports available but there are

200
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,759
many more and usually also that's it

201
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:29,560
externally right well do now pending

202
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,330
from the outside so we can go to this

203
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,458
color report and say that I was what's

204
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,958
there but actually we have access

205
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:37,109
internally to the network internally

206
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,268
many companies are also putting an

207
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,360
internal internal reports and internal

208
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:46,209
reports are also very interesting

209
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,209
because we can also do changes to the

210
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,979
code if we are malicious we are not we

211
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,899
are just doing pen testing to help the

212
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,880
company but attackers are using this

213
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,769
internal report to make to make changes

214
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,990
that happened to Linux kernel few years

215
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,180
ago four years ago some years ago and

216
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,970
have been several cases the people are

217
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,039
modified that hackers are obviously

218
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,019
internal ripples coach so yeah

219
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,339
internally we are we are in doing an

220
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,379
internal to interesting which will also

221
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:14,079
look for a call reports if they have any

222
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:16,869
like Genki or practice Robertson so

223
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,728
they're a bunch of popular reports are

224
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:20,079
the companies are used internally so

225
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:22,749
keep that in mind when you guys are

226
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,669
doing our internal fantastic look for

227
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:26,529
that because chances you will find some

228
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:31,029
interesting standard now usually it's

229
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:34,329
not very well protected as well so what

230
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:36,729
we're looking for do now yes until

231
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:39,519
Indonesian gathering we look from the

232
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:42,699
classic stuff we have high peace domain

233
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,949
names URLs emails click our phone

234
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:48,039
numbers we can find some of this stuff

235
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:49,839
in source code so then that's perfect we

236
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,209
can use that but also we can we can now

237
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,039
start looking for new things we can look

238
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:56,858
for to the earliest people are trying to

239
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,689
put their Twitter in source code did

240
00:09:56,859 --> 00:10:00,879
they do comments and that's perfect we

241
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:02,829
can analyze now we can analyze the

242
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,269
comments to see what people say that's

243
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,579
quite interesting I will talk about that

244
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:09,159
in a little bit unless we can show the

245
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:12,069
activity when people are working what

246
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:14,169
time of the day what days so we can get

247
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:16,059
an idea of the of the objectivity of the

248
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:18,039
company how people are working so that's

249
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:20,858
perfect for example in Microsoft there

250
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,869
is pretty much 24 hours so people can go

251
00:10:20,859 --> 00:10:24,549
where they want so yeah you look at

252
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:26,529
activity you will see them pretty much

253
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:28,809
24 hours people around the cold but yeah

254
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,599
that's not usually does nobody common so

255
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:33,429
and that for example activity is very

256
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:35,439
people use that a lot in when you you

257
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:36,789
when you do for example malware analysis

258
00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:39,759
but we're gonna do the same for source

259
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:41,949
code we can get an idea how long how

260
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,949
fast when our people develop changing

261
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:46,029
making code making changes to the code

262
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:47,709
okay so that's perfect we can get an

263
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,899
idea the idea here is to get a feeling

264
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:55,659
of the company or the developers have

265
00:10:49,899 --> 00:11:01,229
yet okay so now we will move to the to

266
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:01,229
open to the developers some ideas here

267
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:07,238
usually source code I mean usually when

268
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,829
you do have you have to look for reviews

269
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,539
I usually do a lot of core review for

270
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:12,449
their customers and they don't give me

271
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:14,499
anything they just may give me the code

272
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:16,699
actually is the only thing I need but

273
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:19,220
documentation is also not my usual

274
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,990
you don't get that yeah so in this case

275
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,620
we have to read the code there's no

276
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:29,480
there's no no other way so yeah so here

277
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,370
we have read the source look right and

278
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,900
here we have a so now we are going to

279
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,940
see some examples of pieces of

280
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,880
information we can get for example we

281
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,510
have here passing to a well-known fact

282
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,860
in toto

283
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,960
and I'm sure many of you are familiar

284
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,340
with this passing to the American

285
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,040
facility is one of the most popular

286
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:48,860
process right now and here look in this

287
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,750
we have the one of the files this is the

288
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,520
common and they start out the file and

289
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,590
we have some comments here but now I

290
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,949
have some some pieces of information

291
00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:01,480
here so I have a name I have an email

292
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,500
address a domain and a company name so

293
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,180
now I have different pieces of

294
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,560
information by just reading the source

295
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,910
code I didn't go start looking for

296
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,250
example let's say I have to do a pen

297
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,949
testing for this company so I don't go

298
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,660
to the search engines right now I guess

299
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,920
first what I do is I go to the color

300
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,930
reports to see what's there and now I

301
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,199
start to get in a lot of information and

302
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:25,219
has not done any search yet that's quite

303
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,530
interesting and here are the same thing

304
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:31,670
okay I'm looking at another one

305
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:34,930
non-security tool attack and now I can

306
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:37,670
see when they started who started that

307
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:40,250
the name an email address

308
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,910
I should see some relationship here now

309
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:47,450
I still see that Thomas started in 2006

310
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:50,810
till to 1717 and Christopher also went

311
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,280
to 2004 2005 so this has no relationship

312
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,989
there I can start making relationships

313
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,660
so that's interesting that's something

314
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,880
we have to also keep in mind when

315
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,290
targeting companies unless only we see

316
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,740
more people they are occurring

317
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:07,310
yes well Simon so this turns in creator

318
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,960
created created relationships there so

319
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,959
that's interesting from from our point

320
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,850
of view for a pen testing it's something

321
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,380
we can abuse because we for example I

322
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,030
gets an email or try to send a fake

323
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,400
email from one of these guys

324
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:22,550
chances are maybe the other the other

325
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,829
guy will reply faster or he will do some

326
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,449
action I if I ask for example so now I

327
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,730
have a relationship that's that's

328
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:32,620
something I can touch Revere's

329
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,910
so now your tools right so now we will

330
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,590
talk about them defending a bunch of

331
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:41,020
tools we can use one of the tools I like

332
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:45,070
it was a good huh Frank

333
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:48,880
but if huh Frank was very nice to use

334
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:51,220
but the domain has expired and they have

335
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,530
never knew the domain so now it's in

336
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,510
sale we're gonna use that anymore but

337
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,339
still it was quite fine next to use but

338
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,870
all of the mean we can use it have our

339
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,700
Wars for example there there are a bunch

340
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:04,180
of the different domains we can you can

341
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,940
use and that does but these domains do

342
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,939
is they will do searches for github

343
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,410
reports with the more popular I get her

344
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,600
report so we can start doing searches

345
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,850
for a grenade organization a particle

346
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,530
individual and we can system start there

347
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,540
and once I get any information about

348
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,699
that about the company of this title

349
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,209
whatever so that's my testing nice to

350
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:30,850
use these kind of sites to see they all

351
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:34,600
active they are another tool aligned is

352
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:38,920
a good wrap the drop was treated like

353
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,050
two years ago and it was a tool

354
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,020
developed tour to perform reconnaissance

355
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,670
in github reports and the idea for this

356
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,460
tool is to look for credentials and

357
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,990
packet of information like tokens

358
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:53,080
whatever so it's more like a security

359
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:56,290
tool in sense like looking for for miss

360
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,490
configuration and stuff specific

361
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,680
information that should not be there

362
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,910
when we are releasing the code well we

363
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,680
can also use for open source

364
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,410
intelligence because these to Las

365
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,540
organic gathers the persons behind the

366
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,459
code and Twitter and different type of

367
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:13,540
information which is quite nice my next

368
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,670
two years this is the eyes and what

369
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,530
tools are web you install it in your and

370
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,660
your box and just lunch it's quite it's

371
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:25,060
very easy to use and here we have an

372
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:28,890
example and it is a web web app for

373
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,890
example let me put the video

374
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,019
[Music]

375
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,709
okay

376
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:58,060
there we go oh wow that I have to go get

377
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,060
that bigger when we tend to change that

378
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,079
you change that

379
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:30,569
okay there we go with two scream I

380
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:33,269
getting crazy okay so now now we go so

381
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:35,279
now they rip up the way words

382
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:37,410
it's quite simple you there is a new

383
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,299
assessment the green button there up in

384
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,738
the corner you just go there and feel

385
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:43,139
them kill the rap oh you want to analyze

386
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:47,189
just lunch and just wait for a result

387
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:49,049
this okay so so here we have we have

388
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:51,389
done it when we have downloaded

389
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,639
dependent we are not bellowing the code

390
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:55,410
actually from their rappers the only

391
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,269
thing where the loan is the name of the

392
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,519
files and the and the people the back

393
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:01,589
behind I mean the developers and and

394
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,059
that information so here we have like

395
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:08,339
the report from Metasploit from

396
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:11,549
raspberry key ID software the creator of

397
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,198
the doom game and quake so here for

398
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:15,839
example we have some files and the tool

399
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,760
boy will do if we look for sensitive

400
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,559
information the token say passwords of

401
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,559
different type of stuff perfect

402
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:40,269
yeah I think I'm all set okay so sorry

403
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:42,850
about that so here for example we have

404
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:45,999
one of the developers of a raspberry P

405
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,860
Damian I'm from now looking for this I

406
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:49,899
know their name I have a picture I have

407
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,119
the name I have a Twitter account

408
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:53,529
I have location so I'm gonna start to

409
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,230
get in and out of information about this

410
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:59,320
guy so that's fine

411
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,879
that's quite nice well if I especially

412
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,759
when I'm doing a pen testing for a

413
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:05,259
company if I'm looking for a pen testing

414
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,940
for raspberry pee for trumpet for the

415
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:09,879
organics for the foundation I'm

416
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:15,369
targeting information about another guy

417
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:17,049
here so same here we have email name so

418
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:18,639
there's a bunch of different so I can

419
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:26,679
start gathering all the interim about

420
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:28,600
this guy so give it a good prop it's a

421
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:38,070
nice tool to start doing reckon on deep

422
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:38,070
github repos okay

423
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:49,450
back okay so that was a good rugby up

424
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,910
finite stool two years very simple

425
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,710
perfect so we have found so you can also

426
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,240
write your own tools I usually we at the

427
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,970
end we also do that because many times

428
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,200
we have we want some custom stuff so we

429
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,630
have a different people have already

430
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,570
been tried different crowler's we can

431
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,520
use for for github and other in this

432
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,139
case they are specific for github body

433
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,550
you want to look for another report same

434
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,010
thing just do a google search and you

435
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:13,928
will find different colors you can use

436
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:18,970
but yes here there's some other cameras

437
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:22,000
you can you forget for github okay now

438
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,040
we will talk about a something very

439
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,610
funny and hopefully parental is advisory

440
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:30,610
here whatever you see here is no my

441
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:33,159
fault is in the source code keep that in

442
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,709
mind so we're looking here is to analyze

443
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,620
to analyze the angriness of a other

444
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:41,740
developer we want to see this pitch this

445
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,629
people means this developer are angry or

446
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,820
happy because punches and when people

447
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,650
are angry they don't care about anything

448
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,270
so they don't care about security in the

449
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,640
company so that's perfect we can target

450
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,720
that don't thing

451
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,200
doesn't mean when they are happy they

452
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,820
will do measure security but but for

453
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,850
sure whether they are angry they don't

454
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,040
do anything okay so now that we're

455
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:07,449
looking here is for for bad things in

456
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:10,960
code so here we have an example this is

457
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,760
a daily news Lin of Cardinal about the

458
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,450
all the different versions but people

459
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,460
are complaining

460
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,700
so actually you guys look at the other

461
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:22,360
charge you can see downstairs the

462
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,100
different wars fact shed bastard pace

463
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,080
and you can find these wars in the

464
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,428
source code

465
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,449
and you can see for example in in

466
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:35,800
version was that 269 between two six

467
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:38,080
nine and three phone 304 then there was

468
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,850
a lot of swearing there so I don't know

469
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,710
I don't know why I guess there was a lot

470
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,240
of changes in the Linux kernel kernel so

471
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,450
were they they were complaining a lot I

472
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,550
guess that's that's we are so you guys

473
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,410
go to the to the Cardinals you can find

474
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,820
this kind of Wars there so it's quite

475
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,950
interesting to see what's going on but

476
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,870
people but the developers are saying

477
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,330
saying about a code if we're doing

478
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,250
careers that's also good for us because

479
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:04,049
we can look for this kind of wars and

480
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,049
chances that we can find a back there

481
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:11,639
but no no everything is about a bad

482
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,379
worse but it has some good words there

483
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:15,729
and the same here so we have also some

484
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,029
love good

485
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,440
nice sweet in case so this no everything

486
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,480
is bad words and it sucks or some good

487
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,850
words that's that's fine and actually

488
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,710
you can see also they with a Googler

489
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:30,010
yeah there was a lot of good words there

490
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:34,210
about good before even before they the

491
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:40,629
bad words and in the Belgians so that's

492
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:42,519
why interesting to see that so so one

493
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,899
other thing I'll get comments so we were

494
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:46,120
looking for the comment right we will

495
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:48,518
okay we were looking for all this a but

496
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,809
war school boards in in comments we have

497
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,730
to keep in mind that it's a lot of

498
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,440
people in comments you're right and you

499
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,110
guys write code you will know you

500
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,510
something many times you put coding in

501
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,269
the comments or whatever so this this is

502
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:05,320
a lot of data data cleaning we have to

503
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:07,630
do you I guys into data science and big

504
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,820
data there's a term you're familiar with

505
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,649
we have to clean the data same here

506
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,990
there's a lot of stuff we don't care the

507
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:16,239
sort of a code we don't care that we

508
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:19,120
don't care about that in comment but

509
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,029
chars like stars and whatever and

510
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,979
there's also a lot of useless text for

511
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:25,419
example license stuff we don't care

512
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:31,029
about that it doesn't give me any any

513
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:31,659
any any data of that so for example in

514
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:36,700
comment

515
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:42,669
let me show here for example let's go a

516
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:45,519
quake I have already generated all these

517
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:51,779
files because if I do that sometimes it

518
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:51,779
can take some time to to do it so okay

519
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:59,310
so this is the source code for for Quake

520
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,230
and I was looking for a bad word Sam we

521
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:04,169
have a tool and we will talk about that

522
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,850
in a little bit that generator is this

523
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,180
file and here we can see all the bad

524
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,889
words there the file and this is the

525
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,290
code the source code for the quake 3

526
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,970
game very very public I mean it's all

527
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:18,000
game now these days but few years ago

528
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:25,760
was very popular and so for example

529
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:28,500
funny thing is that I cannot see there

530
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,030
ok so one of the files there I mean I

531
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,350
cannot show you because I don't want to

532
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,899
switch to their betwen machine and

533
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:35,820
everything so I will pass but I will let

534
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,530
you guys do that for example there in

535
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,070
their file you guys can see the cursor

536
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,660
there so I was looking around all this

537
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,760
and I went to that file to check it out

538
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,530
and actually these are buffer overflow

539
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,310
in that function and they are talking

540
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,649
about that yes

541
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,270
justified are talking about that so

542
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,490
that's perfect so now there's a buffer

543
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,950
overflow I can exploit their but that's

544
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,500
another subject so looking for so using

545
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:08,270
this technique we can start looking at

546
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:12,270
fine to find security bugs and ok so see

547
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:23,310
where's my nose I'm getting crazy here

548
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:25,410
ok forgive any more examples these are a

549
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:27,510
bunch of zoom and different things

550
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,790
there's for example now we have with the

551
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:39,600
comments as you can see one at least

552
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:41,250
let's take an example there okay so for

553
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,750
example we have an example here of one

554
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:45,840
of the five away one of their projects

555
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,820
we're checking and this is the comment

556
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,429
we are extract all the comments from all

557
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,040
the files in this in this in this

558
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:55,650
project so here as you can see this a

559
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,480
lot of cleaning to do so that's one of

560
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:01,110
the things we are working right now how

561
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,390
to clean all this stuff so so yeah there

562
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,919
are some interesting comments but we

563
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,440
have to find them this the rest is John

564
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,470
we don't care so now yeah we are working

565
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,590
on different techniques to satellites

566
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,950
all this with all this information

567
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:19,030
working progress

568
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:21,370
let's to quite interesting okay so when

569
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:24,700
you have some satellite data we can go

570
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,949
to the social networks and now we have

571
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,190
done it web we have pick on different

572
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:33,250
developers and we want to analyze we

573
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,110
have done a sentiment analysis we just

574
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,870
to see what who are happy or angry they

575
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:44,250
are in Twitter for example so we did

576
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:48,459
that can you guys see their names

577
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:51,340
perfect okay so we have a aircrack john

578
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:54,010
carmack developer of the doom game ID

579
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:58,449
software then Damian Hagen is a

580
00:25:54,010 --> 00:26:03,400
developer for raspberry P and map 10

581
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:06,670
surfer from Google PLC what do you guys

582
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:11,140
think is the more angry person here from

583
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:13,380
this six one of them is more angry than

584
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:17,820
the others can you guys made I guess

585
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,820
who's the most angry person here so

586
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:25,629
guess it's okay tough cow

587
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:33,220
so actually we go to John Carmack

588
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:35,890
developer of the head game as you can

589
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:39,280
see here actually he's the here's a

590
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:41,680
Twitter we took around 300 comments

591
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:45,370
something like that and we analyzed that

592
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:47,140
to see they're happy angry or neutral so

593
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,209
actually in case of John Carmack he's

594
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:56,340
more angry than happy so negative is

595
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:58,600
around 70 70 96 unhappiness he is 15 so

596
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,810
something like so actually he's more

597
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,530
angry than happy on Twitter hopefully

598
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,879
nothing we are live by in two days and

599
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:09,220
so that was quite interesting to see

600
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,120
their and their most happy from these

601
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:15,250
guys and this all these six is a 10

602
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,139
short film actually there's this a lot

603
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,220
of against I don't know I guess these

604
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:25,900
guys in Google are

605
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:28,090
yeah no actually yeah it's positive I

606
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,460
think it's 36 or something like that

607
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,928
negative 8

608
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,700
no batter also I guess they are quite

609
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:36,400
happy working in Google in the tension

610
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,809
flow don't Big Data so yeah we can do a

611
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,549
lot of different things different

612
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:44,129
analysis to get to get a feeling of the

613
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:48,789
developers okay

614
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:50,740
so Internet is one of the tools I've

615
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:54,760
been working this is more like a pet

616
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:58,059
dragon site and it's a source code

617
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,429
intelligence why where does it compiles

618
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:02,740
inside GCC compiler so it's a static

619
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,419
analysis tool you can you can use when

620
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,340
you are compiling projects I will it

621
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:08,049
well you do is take the source code as

622
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,970
you compile and takes a lot of

623
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:11,350
intelligence from the source code and we

624
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,630
can do a lot of interesting stuff with

625
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:16,149
this and and now we are building all

626
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:19,510
these open solution intelligence and

627
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:21,909
talking here into this tool but we are

628
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:25,240
doing much more with this tool looking

629
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:28,950
for security bugs to analyze code so

630
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,950
there are an example of Tintoretto

631
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,480
look at what there

632
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,930
so the Internet is a tool that works

633
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,510
inside DCC it's like a static analysis

634
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,550
that that builds when you are building a

635
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,320
code so what it does if for example

636
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:07,470
antiques we have to we have take the

637
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,629
source code of antiques web server and

638
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,400
get an idea well right now we are not

639
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,840
looking about below melodies we can do

640
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,430
that but while we're looking for is to

641
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,010
understand the source code as soon as

642
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:21,150
possible without reading it so now we

643
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:25,140
have generated this a document from all

644
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:26,940
the antiques antiques source code and

645
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:30,330
it's telling me how many files functions

646
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:32,190
basic blocks language called defendant

647
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:35,179
Eiffel API we have identified if any

648
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:38,070
appeal calls in the source code all the

649
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,440
gimbals there are internal stuff inside

650
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,389
ECC compiler and here we have all the

651
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,990
different files one of the interesting

652
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,150
things about this is yes it also tells

653
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,770
to calculate how long it will take me to

654
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,080
review the entire source code for the

655
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:54,060
aging server this is the last version it

656
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,490
will take a pretty much more than two

657
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,500
weeks full time to review the entire

658
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,940
source code of antique server but

659
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:08,280
hopefully this time this tool can help

660
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:10,770
me to narrow that so so this is the

661
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,139
entire source code there we have other

662
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,060
functions on the different names the

663
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,010
complexity of the function higher

664
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,690
complexity is perfect usual chances are

665
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,820
there's hopefully I can find some

666
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:23,880
security back there so looking for that

667
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:27,210
and the complexity in the green yellow I

668
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,330
looking for red when I see red here red

669
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:32,640
I can go let's see first to define to

670
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:35,120
the file name I can see how many

671
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,060
functions in this name they call graph

672
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,500
relationship between the functions and

673
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:45,480
now folks a bug I can go to this

674
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:50,490
function this is ok so we have the

675
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:54,300
function there some metrics the return

676
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:56,100
values a parameter for the function so I

677
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,500
looking so now I'll tell to understand

678
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,020
the code without reading the code more

679
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:05,850
or less we have the entire function call

680
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:07,080
here we have the basic books of a other

681
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,760
source code we are

682
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,730
reverse engineering something like this

683
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,730
should be quite familiar same same stuff

684
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:18,600
one here so we have answered the green

685
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:21,000
pill and we didn't see the basic book

686
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,209
change in code so that gave us a lot of

687
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,519
things so now it's available in github

688
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,500
in your report and you can download it

689
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,450
on and use it right now you're like what

690
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,100
with GCC but that's something we have to

691
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,100
change but it will take some time

692
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:43,860
ok moving forward so so yeah so actually

693
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,570
you can also do like regular projects

694
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,149
expressions and you can find out of

695
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,710
stuff in source code that for example

696
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:52,018
yeah radiates is your is your friend

697
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:55,799
right and that we are looking for like

698
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:57,179
IP links emails from the things we were

699
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,629
talking before like all they are

700
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:03,990
inclusive patterns like domain names

701
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:05,909
URLs Twitter's account alias in this

702
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:11,010
case a comment so there's a lot of stuff

703
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:13,649
we can do we can look in source code for

704
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,720
example here is an expression here in

705
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:17,418
intensive flow for example you have to

706
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:24,889
do app investing in this company

707
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:27,659
what's that sure ok time up ok so so

708
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:29,158
just using experience I can look for

709
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,750
stuff in source code for example here we

710
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,059
are downloaded the entire attention

711
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,620
field code and we're looking for emails

712
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:36,330
for example let's say I have to do pen

713
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,039
testing for this company instead of

714
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,620
doing Google searches from this all that

715
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:44,190
stuff are usually we do I can go to the

716
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:46,229
source repo and do this a semi-regular

717
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:49,139
expression there and get a lot of info

718
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,120
for couple here I did records looking

719
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:53,039
for email address and now I have a bunch

720
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,600
of email address so I can now I can

721
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,129
create a list of different email

722
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:02,879
accounts I can get an idea of the user

723
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,990
names policy or or whatever I want to do

724
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,330
with this email account

725
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,370
right but now I have a really nice list

726
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,049
and people will start and companies

727
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,809
start start doing a lot of information

728
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:16,279
into the source code because nobody

729
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:20,210
thinks that source code can be dangerous

730
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:22,740
ok I will skip this just in case

731
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,169
so now for example looking looking on

732
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,760
this short code I can get a lot of

733
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,070
information depending depending on the

734
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,890
how active this company is in terms of

735
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,418
the source code but sometimes you can

736
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,240
you can get a lot of information there

737
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:39,870
and now for example like I have my list

738
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,390
with my email account with my domains IP

739
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,279
is what whatever tokens sometimes

740
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:46,260
sometimes you have you find the

741
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:49,770
insurance tokens and interesting stuff

742
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:52,500
there you cannot really use now I have

743
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,510
all that data and now I can I can switch

744
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,909
to all the different tools I've been

745
00:33:54,510 --> 00:34:00,870
array using like multigo reckoning G

746
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:02,610
that exploit or a so right now in custom

747
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,830
scripts for example I was talking there

748
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:06,658
in that come with the data Explorer guys

749
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,520
and they are telling me they are looking

750
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,320
into ways how to implement the things

751
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,940
have been talking about they want to do

752
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,879
something similar but they're still

753
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,260
working what to do so it's a yes har I'm

754
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,000
doing the same thing right

755
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,429
we're still figuring out ways how we can

756
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,899
implement these techniques into how to

757
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:31,770
add to my eyesight or this time so yeah

758
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:34,500
so some of the conclusion here this and

759
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:37,710
now I I hear a lot that data is a new

760
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:41,250
oil perfect so I will say that if that

761
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:43,349
is a new oil source code for sure is the

762
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,330
new goal because we can find a lot of

763
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:46,950
information there for something we can

764
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:49,500
see we can find open source intelligence

765
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:51,928
information we can use like emails the

766
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,339
different stuff we have just seen we can

767
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:56,070
actually find sensitive information

768
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:59,119
there sometimes you can find credentials

769
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:01,440
tokens or other stuff we can we can

770
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,060
extract all the comments and do some

771
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,280
kind of sentiment behavior analysis

772
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,900
there and actually we can also find

773
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,089
below relatives I was looking for all

774
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,880
this when I was looking all these their

775
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:13,920
reports I have fine already a Buddha

776
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,170
ladies I was known I was not looking for

777
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,270
I was looking for the bad words I was I

778
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,770
was looking for comments and that way I

779
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,490
I was able to find different type of

780
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:26,970
varieties so that's nice and of course

781
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:29,459
Cole reports are usually not less or not

782
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,290
or usually less monitor a lot of

783
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,270
companies now or boy I will

784
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:36,380
say a lot but some companies usually now

785
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:39,450
that's doing a little doing monitors

786
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:43,290
this is falling okay so there they are

787
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:45,569
doing more monitors of the other social

788
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,860
networks and all that stuff so when we

789
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,530
do an app interesting we don't want to

790
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,090
get cut so for example now call reports

791
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,250
allow us to get a lot of information

792
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,200
about usually our target without going

793
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,400
usually the traditional ways in social

794
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,589
networks or stuff like that

795
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,900
and and for sure Cora Porsche I usually

796
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:07,620
know that monitor so we can we can take

797
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:09,480
advantage about that okay so next steps

798
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,799
so I was mentioned before that this is a

799
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,010
work in progress so there's a lot of

800
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,290
things to be done yeah we have to

801
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:18,630
improve improve the tools a lot we have

802
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:22,020
to know we have to automatize tamati is

803
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,460
this as as as much as we can we have to

804
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,110
do better a common analysis and

805
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,370
classification are the comments from

806
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:29,160
appliance from natural language

807
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,020
techniques into the common analysis for

808
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,029
sure and then we have to also integrate

809
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,910
to that asteroid or reckoning ji very

810
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:38,580
popular tool for for recurrence so yeah

811
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,299
when we saw there's a lot of things to

812
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,740
be done here

813
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:46,530
and you guys interesting in this field

814
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:48,569
go for it and I think I think having

815
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:56,820
pretty much cover all my bases right now

816
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:59,100
you guys have any any questions no

817
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,800
perfect so the other thing is I want to

818
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:05,200
wish good luck to all the teams tomorrow

819
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:09,300
and your and your the ACF Thanks

820
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,299
[Applause]

821
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,940
you
