172
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:23,940
your work is essential in this field

173
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:26,130
I believe that the European Union and we

174
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,659
can say that the whole developed world

175
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,789
the Western world the Democratic world

176
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:36,510
has to think about and work on these

177
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:39,059
aspects our democracies and I say so in

178
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:41,939
plural need to feel safe and secure in

179
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:44,579
this regard and to be more democratic we

180
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:48,149
have to be more cyber safe cyber secure

181
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:51,449
to ensure compatibility between progress

182
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:53,459
in IT which opens up a wonderful world

183
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,550
of opportunities for the whole society

184
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:59,609
in general and make this compatible with

185
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:04,109
security this is absolutely essential

186
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:06,360
so for Malecha to host this event with

187
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,420

that were mentioned by the mayor

227
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,410
opportunities vocational commitment and

228
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,329
teamwork

229
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:02,310
and the need for us to feel cyber secure

230
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:04,949
it is a turn off the most thinnest

231
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:08,279
Economou he is the head of a personal

232
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:10,699
security unit in an ISA big applause for

233
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,699

234
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,250
thank you very much welcome to Malacca

235
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:25,359
and to the final of the European cyber

236
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,680
security challenge as I was presenting

237
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,690
my name is the most honest Kannamma and

238
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,359
I'm working at the European Union Agency

239
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,910
for Network and information security

240
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,350
today is a very different day for us

241
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,180
because first of all is the last day of

242
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,130
the cyber security month of the European

243
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,829
cyber security month I don't know how

244
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:44,710
many of you are familiar with the cyber

245
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,210
security month but the challenge for a

246
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,550
couple of years now it's becoming an

247
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:52,450
element of it so the cyber security

248
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:55,030
month is namely the month of October is

249
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:58,150
dedicated in Europe to activities in the

250
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:01,000
area of cyber security with the aim of

251
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,130
increasing the capabilities on cyber

252
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,650
security of average citizens are also

253
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:08,200
professionals and also increasing

254
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,120
awareness in European Union on the

255
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,730
challenges that people face with their

256
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,020
interaction with technology in terms of

257
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,610
security in their daily life and privacy

258
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:21,160
as I said we decided some time ago to

259
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:24,070
make the cyber security challenge an

260
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,630
integral part of the month and it's not

261
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,720
an accident at the end of the cyber

262
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:31,050
security month we have the final of the

263
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,390
challenge taking place here in Malaga

264
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,359
for us and easie the challenge is

265
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,010
something that we have been involved for

266
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,690
more than a couple of years now it's

267
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,850
something that we consider to be very

268
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,860
important although it's something

269
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,260
extremely different from the things that

270
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,580
we usually do in our daily lives I guess

271
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:54,270
the same applies to many organizations

272
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:56,950
involved it falls within this nature of

273
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:00,610
like lifelong training and improving

274
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,620
skills and improving the capability of

275
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,510
professionals in the area of network

276
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,690
information security which is something

277
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,160
which is one of our priorities and it's

278
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,200
something that we will continue to

279
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,480
invest overtime already today is not

280
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,130
accidental that at the end of the

281
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,810
session there will be a meeting where

282
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,300
all the representatives of the counters

283
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,300
taking place at the cyber security

284
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,120
challenge will be present and in essence

285
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,510
we will discuss what we'll do in two

286
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,730
natan so I can guarantee to you that

287
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,010
there will be final in 2018 there will

288
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,470
be a final for the next few years it's a

289
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,240
commitment from our side and all the

290
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,890
people that are here and are working and

291
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,150
contributing towards this I can

292
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,880
guarantee to you that they are also

293
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:45,199
committed in in continuing there are

294
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,430
already many ideas many I would say even

295
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,320
optimistic ideas on how we want to see

296
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,729
the future with the challenge even

297
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,500
increasing the competition we are

298
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,220
currently at 15 countries and we are

299
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,310
very happy about that but we will not

300
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,860
stop here already internally we have

301
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,719
some bets with colleagues on what will

302
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:10,470
be the number of counters participating

303
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:13,230
in 2018 so just to close down to close

304
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,330
this little intervention I would like to

305
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,610
thank all of you first of all for being

306

makes this competition possible I would

309
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,770
like to thank of my colleagues that

310
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,510

311
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,750
the competition for their collaboration

312
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,630

313
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,400
leading to the final I would like to

314
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,140
thank the city of Malaga for having us

315
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,850
here it's an excellent opportunity for

316
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,620
me it was the first time to visit Malaga

317
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,610
and I was really excited to be here for

318
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,380
a couple of days already

319
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:48,270
I would like thinking FIBA probably

320
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,920

all of us I know how much I haven't seen

323
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:57,540

324
00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:00,180
someone I revel in his team they did a

325
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,640
lot of effort not only in terms of time

326
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,199
and money but also personal effort in

327
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,730
making this competition possible and I

328
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,270

[Applause]

332
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,300

333
