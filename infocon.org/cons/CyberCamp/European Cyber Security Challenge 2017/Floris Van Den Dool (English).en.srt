1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,420
we continue because accent to ambitions

2
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,640
innovation as a key pillar of

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,450
cybersecurity strategy in the new

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,460
digital world they learn let's learn how

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,830
they help their clients innovating in

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,230
cybersecurity and how they use security

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,409
in any innovation serious to ensure they

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,950
move securely to a new digital and safe

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:39,000
world the title is secure innovation

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,839
innovate security and we receive with a

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,100
big applause now to flourish Bandon dual

12
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:54,449
of AK center high floor is nice to meet

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,890
you thank you welcome thank you I'd like

14
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,620
to be welcomed on stage like that

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,809
doesn't always happen thank you and

16
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,659
thank you for for having us here it's a

17
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,780
great opportunity for us as Accenture to

18
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:12,440
be part of this cyber challenge and to

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:15,899
meet a lot of particularly young people

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,429
too many men you spoke about that and

21
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:19,950
I'll come back to that later

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,530
because I fully agree with your with

23
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,210
your point we need more females and to

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,399
me that's part of the innovation we're

25
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,429
looking for but I want to I want to take

26
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,649
it one step back from the discussion we

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,070
just had because yes I'm very passionate

28
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:38,490
about security yes I love technology yes

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,979
I love to be able to penetrate or hack

30
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,039
into my clients network and to help make

31
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,320
the world safer like that but we we're

32
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:49,200
not in security just because it's so

33
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,079
cool we should be in security to make

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,210
the world a safer place the world really

35
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,729
needs us I mean there's a bigger story

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,249
out there than just our Security's cool

37
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,950
technology is cool this is really about

38
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:03,839
what can we do to make sure we can keep

39
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,359
progressing and changing the world

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,000
around us in a safe and secure way and

41
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,730
that's why we need to secure innovation

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,100
and to be able to do that we actually as

43
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,100
security professionals need to embrace

44
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,530
innovation and use innovation ourselves

45
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,440
to make the world more secure so that's

46
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,100
the two messages I will have so let's

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,079
first talk a little

48
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,730
about innovation what do I mean when I

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,740
say innovation and what is happening in

50
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,730
the world around us remember this

51
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:36,120
picture remember this guy

52
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,170
poor Arnie in his movie Terminator

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,870
sometimes not knowing whether he's a

54
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,329
good guy or a bad guy

55
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,120
well actually this was all a story about

56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,800
and after I forget when this movie was

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,750
released but it's a long time ago a

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:55,570
story about forming a colony on Mars

59
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,580
terraforming Mars well there's a good

60
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,560
guy or a bad guy out there at the moment

61
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,740
who's actually who actually wants to

62
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,420
send an expedition to Mars so science

63
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,030
fiction is actually becoming reality

64
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,280
we've been caught up on what's happening

65
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,050
the world around us is changing much

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,790
faster than we then we thought in a

67
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:18,130
science fiction day and I may be too old

68
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,560
but I remember this I used to to watch

69
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,500
this is anyone remember the Knight Rider

70
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,660
it's okay so I'm not the only oldest guy

71
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,700
in the in the audience I mean we thought

72
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,650
that was the coolest thing to talk into

73
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,450
your watch it's a kid come and pick me

74
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,050
up and then your car would come around

75
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:39,070
the corner well it's happening today we

76
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,080
have self-driving cars and I don't know

77
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,540
prediction is in particularly in the

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,250
congested areas in the world five to ten

79
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:50,230
years there will be predominantly self

80
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,020
autonomous cars because they can solve a

81
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,570
lot of the problems around

82
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:58,810
sustainability traffic jams etc etc so

83
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,760
science fiction is becoming reality very

84
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,230
very fast and the world around us is

85
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:08,260
changing and we've actually come a long

86
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:10,390
way it didn't just happen overnight it

87
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,340
started with the web and the internet

88
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:17,169
and they brought out already a lot of

89
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:20,108
change in mm or mm we got mobility and

90
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,900
the services became mobile today's we

91
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:26,650
like to say we live in the era of living

92
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,330
services the services are our are all

93
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,590
around us the world is really changing

94
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,270
very fast and when I say living services

95
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,520
what do I really mean I want to show a

96
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,900
short clip Accenture has acquired this

97
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,198
company called sure that

98
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:44,409
see that that Shore logo and they are

99
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,840
thinking a lot about how is technology

100
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,500
changing and disrupting our lives and I

101
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,909
want to show a short video to actually

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,910
show that I hope it works

103
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:13,508
can we roll the video there we go

104
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:13,509
[Applause]

105
00:05:17,410 --> 00:07:15,139
[Music]

106
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,659
so that's what we mean when we say

107
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:27,770
living services the services are all

108
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:30,830
around you they actually change

109
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:32,719
depending on what you do they learn more

110
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,050
about you they learn more about your

111
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,270
needs they understand your preferences I

112
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,400
don't know who view is using Google now

113
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,500
for instance but it's a good example of

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,020
such a service that really gets to know

115
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,990
you that really changes your life I

116
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:51,139
don't I don't know about you but I live

117
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:53,780
in a congested area I live in just

118
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,610
outside Amsterdam in the Netherlands so

119
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,010
in the morning Google now will tell me

120
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,410
are you I've got a meeting at 9:30 it's

121
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:04,400
in the Amsterdam offers that's terrible

122
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,479
traffic jam so you better leave at 7:30

123
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,650
rather than at 8:00 to get there on time

124
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,210
and by the way you shouldn't take you

125
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,489
normal route you should take a different

126
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,650
route so the service knows me knows all

127
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,360
right typically travel knows my calendar

128
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:21,138
and gives me that kind of information

129
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,479
and it changes on the spot when I'm on

130
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:27,910
the road it will say hey there's a it's

131
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:31,669
been an accident change the way you go

132
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,950
and they more and more using wearables

133
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,838
they're getting really really close so

134
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,490
the internet and that's why also what we

135
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
call it living service this is really

136
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,299
getting closer and closer it's no longer

137
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,779
somewhere on a computer now it's really

138
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:47,630
getting close to you and it it impacts

139
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:49,250
your daily life I'd like that example at

140
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,520
the end probably because I spend a lot

141
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,380
of time on on aeroplanes flying around

142
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,510
wouldn't it be great if you're watching

143
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,089
a movie on the flight and then you can

144
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:00,589
actually continue watching that movie

145
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,709
when you when you get home it knows

146
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:05,330
where you where you left off and it can

147
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,880
pick it up from there you can watch it

148
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:10,760
at the moment but most services that's

149
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,200
not possible unless they start streaming

150
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,689
Netflix

151
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:19,250
on aeroplanes then I guess it would be

152
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:24,120
possible and how will these living

153
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:25,750
services change our life well a lot of

154
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,730
[Music]

155
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:31,190
easy decisions are gonna be made by

156
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,110
these computers what time do I need to

157
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,630
leave my home to get on into the office

158
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,130
on time and the services will tell me

159
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,439
well if you leave now you'll be there at

160
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,580
that time and if you go by train you'll

161
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,020
be there at that time so easy decisions

162
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,360
long time then learn more and more about

163
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,970
what we do and they may even even say

164
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,330
hey I see every day you do this maybe

165
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:57,710
you want me to do that for you there's a

166
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:59,630
lot of data and analytics behind it and

167
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,480
they collect more and more information

168
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:08,180
from sensors all over the world cameras

169
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,460
weather traffic information etc etc and

170
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,829
it becomes a connected environment it's

171
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,810
no longer just the financial services

172
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,720
industry or the traffic industry now it

173
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,939
brings together all that data so if you

174
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,460
see your word data a lot of time I've

175
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,670
used the word

176
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,760
your personal life is it already setting

177
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,560
off any alarm bells with anyone I hope

178
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,640
it does we're in a room full of security

179
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,770
professionals

180
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,110
I hope you already started to think but

181
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:38,510
hang on if the world like around me is

182
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,270
going to change like this what about

183
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:44,270
security hold on to that thought because

184
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,800
that's of course where we want to go and

185
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:49,100
it's not just stopping and it's not just

186
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,229
young people at extent you will do a lot

187
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,480
of surveys and we survey the market

188
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,100
about young people all the people the

189
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,760
digital generation are people actually

190
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:06,500
getting online and we see that a 68

191
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:09,740
percent of young kids between 14 to 17

192
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,890
year old plan to buy smart words in the

193
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:16,250
next five years but it's not only those

194
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:21,670
young kids also 40 percent of the people

195
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:23,779
the age group my age group 24 to 54

196
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,329
already own a commune

197
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:28,220
of a tablet laptop a desktop and a

198
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:29,748
smartphone if you look at the average

199
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:33,769
home the average person is using

200
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:36,980
multiple screens already 61% of people

201
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:42,709
who are planning a new TV are planning

202
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:45,199
to buy a smart TV and 87% of people

203
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:47,149
don't use one screen to look at but use

204
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:50,149
multiple screens or you can read the

205
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:53,329
statistics so it's everywhere and the

206
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:55,459
consumers the hyper-connected consumers

207
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,469
as we call them here on this slide they

208
00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:00,138
basically are really consuming digital

209
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:03,589
all the time everywhere I mean just look

210
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:05,629
around you the use of mobile phones but

211
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:08,600
it's at the moment it's really

212
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:10,459
everywhere and why is that because

213
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,430
everything is becoming digitized

214
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:17,209
information at our fingertips we want to

215
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:19,550
have the digital info capability and

216
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:21,800
it's also because something we started

217
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:23,389
calling liquid expectations what do we

218
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,269
mean with liquid expectation I don't

219
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:28,610
know who view is an uber user

220
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:32,509
I know it's legal in Spain it's not

221
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:36,439
legal everywhere in Europe but in uber

222
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:37,519
if you get in a in a taxi you've told

223
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:39,230
the driver where you want to go because

224
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,790
that's the information you got when you

225
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,769
call the driver in the first place but

226
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,389
when you get out there's a big

227
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,639
difference between getting out of a

228
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,399
normal taxi and getting out of an uber

229
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,170
cab because you don't pay you just get

230
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,059
out say thank you see you it's great

231
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,490
right because the payment is done

232
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:58,040
automatically that's a fantastic service

233
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,259
now what do we mean with liquid

234
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,319
expectations because we get used to that

235
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:05,899
surf as we'd like that servers we expect

236
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:08,000
the same thing the next time we go to

237
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,889
the supermarket why can't the

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,129
supermarket do something like that that

239
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:15,470
I can walk out without paying or why can

240
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:17,899
I do that when I go to a restaurant that

241
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,939
I basically order online I go to the

242
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,970
restaurant I eat and I just leave and

243
00:13:19,939 --> 00:13:24,920
they have my details and so that's what

244
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,769
we mean with liquid expectations we get

245
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,870
used to service that we really like and

246
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:31,850
we expect that servers and all kinds of

247
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:34,250
other parts of life and that's why

248
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,160
consumers are really driving this all

249
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,610
change and why companies have to follow

250
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:42,709
so if you look at innovation if you look

251
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,020
at how the world changing around it it's

252
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,790
a world of opportunity everything is

253
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,670
changing the digital competitive

254
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,349
landscape is still building the ubers of

255
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,660
this world are only just starting to

256
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,110
come to fruition and the playing field

257
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,250
is wide open it's a fantastic world

258
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:04,550
nobody can stop us

259
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:11,240
or can they so there's a famous saying

260
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:13,930
by an old philosopher Paul Virilio who

261
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,090
said when we invented the ship

262
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:19,790
innovation we also invented the

263
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:23,300
shipwreck now I think that should be

264
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:25,849
every security professionals motto if

265
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,520
you invent the ship you also invent the

266
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,950
shipwreck now I've been in security for

267
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,960
close to thirty years always a bit

268
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,770
hesitant to say that because it shows my

269
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,890
age but yes I've been in security for

270
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:42,380
just about 30 years and traditionally in

271
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:45,319
security what do we do when somebody

272
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,210
comes with a new idea what happened when

273
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,790
the first people started using mobile

274
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:53,420
phones what is security professional

275
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:55,400
said no don't do it it's dangerous what

276
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,069
happened when we all went wanted to go

277
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,990
to the cloud what did the security

278
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,640
professionals do they said no don't go

279
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,930
to the cloud it's dangerous you don't

280
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,770
know what's going to happen let's

281
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,420
control our data security people and I

282
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,189
hope I'm not insulting anyone I'm a

283
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,199
security person myself so I think I'm

284
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,680
allowed to say it security people

285
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,680
unknown in the industry in society as

286
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,050
the people who can only say no we are

287
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,920
the naysayers of the industry we always

288
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:28,250
say no that's risky don't do it but just

289
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,660
imagine think back 500 years 600 years

290
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,210
or whatever when we started inventing

291
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,949
those big ships think you were the

292
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:36,440
security officer of this big shipping

293
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,080
company it said what put people on a

294
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,830
ship sailing across the ocean to the end

295
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,790
of the world

296
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:45,620
no that's dangerous that's risky I mean

297
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,410
think about all the things we wouldn't

298
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,540
have today we security people would have

299
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,850
stopped the ship

300
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:55,368
we do not want to stop innovation

301
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:57,259
because there are risks yes people died

302
00:15:55,369 --> 00:16:00,199
when I got on a boat yes there are

303
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:01,519
shipwrecks all over the world but does

304
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,089
that mean we shouldn't go out sailing

305
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,100
does that mean we should stop progress

306
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:10,069
no the real job of security

307
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,889
professionals not to say no if you say

308
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:15,170
yes this is great let me help you to

309
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:21,499
understand the risks and let me help you

310
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:23,329
to make it secure let's invent boats

311
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:25,730
that we can put on the boat that you can

312
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:28,459
sail away or row away if there's a if

313
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,689
there's a disaster let's invent right

314
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:31,878
life rafts

315
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:35,589
that's what security people need to do

316
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:37,850
we need to innovate ourselves as well

317
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,369
but at the moment with all the

318
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,199
innovation and I asked you before are

319
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:45,230
there any alarm bells already ringing

320
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:50,059
with all the innovation that's already

321
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:52,129
coming the risks are very very clear so

322
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:54,499
yes we need Tiger teams yes we need to

323
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,970
do all those things because just look at

324
00:16:54,499 --> 00:17:00,199
the numbers the numbers are really

325
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:04,629
staggering just in 2016 2 billion

326
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:04,628
personal records in the US

327
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:12,649
sorry globally was stolen and in the

328
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:15,260
u.s. one of out of three citizens had

329
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:17,569
their personal health data stolen now I

330
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,949
don't know about you but if there's one

331
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,079
thing I really care about it's my

332
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:24,140
personal health data I don't want

333
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:27,648
everyone to know that I'm overweight or

334
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,450
something or that my wife is pregnant or

335
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:32,059
I mean those are things that you want to

336
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,730
keep private just and one out of three

337
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:36,918
people in the US has that data stolen

338
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,890
that's terrible and we need to do

339
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:44,000
something about it

340
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:47,000
80% of all cyberattacks are driven by

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,220
organized crime rings I mean the world

342
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,950
is completely different than it was 10

343
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,880
years ago we're dealing with very

344
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:58,309
serious attackers at the moment they

345
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,740
have lots of tools they use innovation

346
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:02,759
they share information they share data

347
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,629
so we're up

348
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:10,079
against a really formidable formidable

349
00:18:05,629 --> 00:18:14,639
enemy and adversary there's all kinds of

350
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:17,099
estimates but the number of losses in

351
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:18,718
cyber security here it says 400 billion

352
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:22,019
other reports we'll give you another

353
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:24,659
number but they are staggering the cyber

354
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,789
crime numbers in the global economy is

355
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:27,449
really staggering it really has an

356
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:31,408
impact

357
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:34,589
that's why security matters it's just

358
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:37,289
it's gonna stop people from embracing

359
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:38,819
new change that's something we need to

360
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,029
be worried about that's something we

361
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:46,699
need to help change I mean that's more

362
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:49,739
than the GDP of 160 countries together

363
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:52,889
and it's bigger than the entire illegal

364
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:57,299
drug trade so cybercrime is really

365
00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:59,689
becoming a crime problem number one and

366
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:02,339
it's not something the police or the FBI

367
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,529
etcetera are going to solve definitely

368
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,839
not all on their own we need to work

369
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:09,199
collectively on that the World Economic

370
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:12,299
Forum thinks it's about it's the fifth

371
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:14,669
global risk I'm gonna say fifth you have

372
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:17,158
to think about how do they look at those

373
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:18,859
risk well it's right up there with the

374
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:21,929
risk of terrorist attacks

375
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:23,428
so when you say Isis when you say well

376
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:25,799
the terrible attacks we had in Madrid

377
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,989
and in other places in Europe cyber

378
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:35,039
security is right up there up there and

379
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:39,479
and Malaka yeah yeah it's and the world

380
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,419
keeps changing by 2020 there's going to

381
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:43,709
the attack surface all the places where

382
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,899
people can attack us basically the

383
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:49,739
living services that I just spoke about

384
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:51,748
is going to be 50 times as big as it is

385
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:54,899
at the moment so if you think today is

386
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:58,139
difficult in 2020 it's going to be 50

387
00:19:54,899 --> 00:20:01,768
times as difficult so a traditional

388
00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:05,099
approach of let's see if we can monitor

389
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:07,739
and spot and find the attacker let's see

390
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:09,869
if we can prevent the attacker it's just

391
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:12,059
not working anymore and if it's not

392
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:14,488
working today it's definitely not gonna

393
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,970
work in 2020 when the attack service is

394
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:17,830
50 times as big

395
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,320
that's the problem we're dealing with

396
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,360
debt rise security such a hot topic and

397
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,899
that's why all of us should be really

398
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,649
excited to be working in insecurity and

399
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:31,178
consumers are getting more cautious I

400
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:32,860
don't know if you see it in your in your

401
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:36,340
personal life but again we did a survey

402
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,959
and we see that 54% of consumers are

403
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,418
getting really cautious they don't just

404
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,070
they don't want to give information on

405
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:43,629
the internet anymore they read

406
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,120
newspapers they read about those

407
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:47,949
breaches and I said well do I really

408
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,529
want to give this information online can

409
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,840
I trust this service and the real

410
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:55,960
question for business is becoming how

411
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,539
trustworthy are you can you create trust

412
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,610
online and how do you do that and again

413
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:02,889
and I keep saying that that's where we

414
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,459
come in great opportunity for security

415
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:08,229
professionals yeah I just listed those

416
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:12,159
companies that consumers according to

417
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:14,940
our survey trust

418
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,559
I was surprised by this number one

419
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,899
apparently together we trusted telco

420
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:22,299
operators the most and then secondly we

421
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:25,000
trust the banks after all the what

422
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:27,129
they've done the the financial crisis

423
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,080
etc they're apparently we still trust

424
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:32,529
them and the number three consumer

425
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,570
electronic companies Apple Sam Soon

426
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:38,320
apparently those are companies we still

427
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,700
trust just for your information so I

428
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,649
think I've already given a lot of

429
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,269
challenges right you're here for a big

430
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:46,090
challenge but what are the cybersecurity

431
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:47,440
challenges companies are facing at the

432
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,009
moment and I've already given some

433
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,870
examples this is just a list of the

434
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:55,679
complexity of today's cyber security

435
00:21:52,870 --> 00:22:00,879
environment for any organization

436
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,740
companies government's the network the

437
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:04,870
networks become so bacon we go to the

438
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,639
cloud as well so how can we monitor

439
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,250
what's going on how do we know is

440
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:12,789
entering our network how do we protect

441
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:15,190
content well it sounds easy but just

442
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:17,259
think about companies because those

443
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:19,870
services are living and because we share

444
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:21,940
information the content that you have is

445
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,158
actually not no longer in your own hand

446
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,940
because you share the content with your

447
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,200
suppliers you share with your partners

448
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,799
content goes through the cloud I said

449
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,960
you

450
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:33,668
control your own content anymore that's

451
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,679
part of the whole change that's part of

452
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:38,080
the Living Services together

453
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,830
collectively we work on content how do

454
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,470
you protect that digital identity one of

455
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,699
the cornerstones of security this is

456
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,299
where I put on a little bit of my

457
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:52,029
professor hat a lecturer at University

458
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:55,600
in Rotterdam as well and I always tell

459
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:58,239
my students without identity without

460
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,119
authentication there is no security

461
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:02,710
because if you don't know what kind of

462
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,959
X's someone has if you don't even know

463
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,929
who someone is how can you determine

464
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,830
what kind of access they need and

465
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:12,210
identities become one of the biggest

466
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:15,580
problems in the whole living services

467
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,710
arena because we want convenience as a

468
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,080
consumer I want to be in sitting in an

469
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,210
aeroplane watching a movie and then go

470
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,090
home and finish the movie that requires

471
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:28,929
that my identity needs to travel from

472
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:32,470
the the airline company that was giving

473
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:35,379
me the movie to my cable company that is

474
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,779
giving me the the movie that continues

475
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:40,959
so identities that travel across

476
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:44,019
multiple channels so my identity needs

477
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,450
to come much closer to me so you're

478
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:49,539
talking about things like biometrics etc

479
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:52,149
etc so there's a big change happening at

480
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:54,309
the moment around digital identity and

481
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:59,439
again security professionals can play a

482
00:23:54,309 --> 00:24:02,259
big role and an extent you by helping a

483
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,899
lot of companies to go digital banks to

484
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:08,139
go multi-channel telcos to start

485
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:10,389
streaming content etc but it's

486
00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:12,549
impossible to do that without identity

487
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:14,799
so that's where security comes in so

488
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:17,739
that means that any digital project we

489
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,330
do at Accenture has security embedded

490
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,519
into it because we need to make sure we

491
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,109
have at least identity not to mention

492
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,440
all the other things so identity is

493
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:28,090
crucial for security visibility of

494
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,590
malicious activities can be even

495
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,899
discover what is happening on our

496
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:34,600
network and already gave some examples I

497
00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:36,939
know I'll show some details on one of

498
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,428
the next slides as well how do we know

499
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,379
what's going on on our network even when

500
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:42,770
it's not our network anymore how do we

501
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,840
know what's going on on the net

502
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,850
of a cloud provider how do we know

503
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,550
what's going on in my industry and he's

504
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:53,990
coming after me as well so having that

505
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:56,120
visibility is incredibly important

506
00:24:53,990 --> 00:25:01,370
managing device security there was a

507
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:04,010
question before about IOT IOT is

508
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:06,290
becoming fundamentally important in

509
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,990
security but security is no longer just

510
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,420
about the office environment but what if

511
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,910
I wanted to have an impact on the

512
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:19,460
economy of a country of whatever I

513
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:21,620
wanted to impact an energy provider well

514
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,170
I can bring down the SA P system so they

515
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,659
cannot send out any invoices yeah that's

516
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,360
a nuisance but in the end big deal by

517
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:34,060
saying how the invoice is a week later

518
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:36,800
but if I can attack the energy facility

519
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,220
and stop them from actually producing

520
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,169
energy

521
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,240
I could actually cripple the entire

522
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,370
company and I could cost them lots and

523
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,770
lots of money and because everything is

524
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,600
becoming connected those devices need to

525
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,780
be secured and you know what the big

526
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,879
problem is with those IOT or i io T

527
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,340
industrial Internet of Things devices

528
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,040
they're old many of them are still

529
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,320
running Windows NT and you're not

530
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,270
allowed to touch them because the

531
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,840
provider of those devices gives a

532
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:08,230
warranty that he'll keep them running

533
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:12,620
but to keep them running all the time

534
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:14,540
you cannot patch them so they're fraught

535
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,800
with vulnerabilities and they're out

536
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:19,129
there they're out there in their

537
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,960
millions so that's the next wave of

538
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,030
security issues that we are seeing and

539
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,980
we security professionals need to be

540
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,899
ready for that we need to help those

541
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,780
organizations to fix that environment

542
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,060
and then I haven't even mentioned the

543
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:36,230
IOT environment that is rapidly started

544
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:38,360
to develop at people's houses and in the

545
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,900
put in a public environment with cameras

546
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:46,010
online etc etc so IOT is really becoming

547
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:49,190
the next big thing in security data

548
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:51,260
protection I already spoke about content

549
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,230
prevention what we need to get much

550
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:56,330
better at is protecting data regardless

551
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:58,309
of where it lives if I

552
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:00,799
put a file on a USB Drive it should be

553
00:26:58,309 --> 00:27:03,740
encrypted automatically so that if my

554
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,200
USB Drive gets stolen or lost at least

555
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,690
it's not easily available just to anyone

556
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,940
and if I put data in the cloud it should

557
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,480
also be encrypted so we need to protect

558
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:18,580
data very close to the data in the end

559
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,690
security as much as we always talk about

560
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,820
vulnerabilities and operating systems

561
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,309
and applications in the end security is

562
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,928
about the data because that's what we

563
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:28,610
want to get that's why we get valued

564
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:30,350
that's why you can actually steal money

565
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,959
that's where you can steal credentials

566
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,850
an identity it's about data so let's

567
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,010
focus on protecting the data and the

568
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,320
data that really matters and it's a big

569
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,970
issue for organizations typically they

570
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,710
don't even know how much data that I

571
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:48,380
have or where the data is and most just

572
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:50,659
another statistic most of

573
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:54,380
business-critical data is not an

574
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:57,139
applications 70% of business critical

575
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,630
data is what we call unstructured what

576
00:27:57,139 --> 00:28:02,959
does it mean it's it's an email sits in

577
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:05,299
Word documents PowerPoint files that's

578
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,120
where a lot of critical data is is that

579
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:12,980
secured by corporate security typically

580
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:14,989
not or not good enough so securing data

581
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,820
is a big problem and then of course

582
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,549
there's all these new regulations about

583
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,710
privacy there's this whole gdpr thing

584
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:23,360
coming organizations are really

585
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,669
struggling with that we need to protect

586
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,949
that as well and that many organizations

587
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:30,830
make the mistake saying oh I've done

588
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,340
gdpr I'm compliant I should be secure

589
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,649
now

590
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,449
well I'm sorry that's not the case GDP

591
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:37,908
are only goes about privacy sensitive

592
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,279
data it's not about your financial day

593
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:42,169
that's not about your trade secrets as

594
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:45,440
an organization so there's much more

595
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:47,269
than just these compliance thing and of

596
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,070
course I already mentioned the criminals

597
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:51,200
themselves are increasingly very

598
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,570
sophisticated we're not dealing with

599
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,289
script kiddies anymore we're dealing

600
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:58,700
with organized crime and they innovate

601
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:01,309
and they have technology that in many

602
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,919
cases we are not even even using

603
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:06,500
ourselves so we have to change our

604
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,970
mindset in cyber security this is a

605
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,280
complex picture with lots of data

606
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:13,679
me the most important part of this

607
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,658
picture is actually showing that we need

608
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,780
to understand better what is happening

609
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,690
in our environment I mean let's be

610
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,639
honest as much as you guys in your

611
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,840
challenge are probably gonna try and

612
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:31,590
prevent things from going wrong

613
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:34,649
prevention has failed we cannot prevent

614
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,270
things from going wrong if there's one

615
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,630
company I really admire from a

616
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,740
technology point of view it's Netflix

617
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:43,110
and there's many things I admire about

618
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,240
what Netflix is doing on technology but

619
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,070
one thing in a philosophy I really like

620
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,130
and maybe some of you have heard about

621
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:54,470
it Netflix has this thing called chaos

622
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:56,970
monkey nice term what is chaos monkey

623
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,130
it's basically a project it's a group of

624
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,730
people in Netflix that have only one

625
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:06,419
objective and that is to bring down any

626
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,600
machine in Netflix not just a test

627
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:13,409
machine know the production machines

628
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:15,600
these guys have one successful success

629
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:18,390
criterium if they bring down a machine

630
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,059
at Netflix they have succeeded then

631
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,970
we'll get a bonus or whatever now I set

632
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:26,970
that to one of my clients a big telco

633
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:29,159
said do youdo those testing they said in

634
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,590
a live environment are you kidding our

635
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,840
clients would notice so well that's

636
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,639
exactly the point if you add net when

637
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,860
you were watching Netflix ever notice

638
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,309
that the server's went down no you

639
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,889
haven't

640
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:43,908
why not because everyone in Netflix

641
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:47,340
knows my system is going to be attacked

642
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:49,320
my system will go down I don't know if

643
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,059
it's today or tomorrow but it will go

644
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,320
down it will be taken offline by these

645
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:57,480
chaos monkeys so I better design for

646
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,950
redundancy I better make sure that if

647
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,049
this server goes down there's another

648
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,000
server that can take over of course my

649
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:05,970
clients are not supposed to notice that

650
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,400
so it changes the perception of the

651
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:10,380
designers at Netflix they don't think

652
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,740
well maybe something go will go wrong no

653
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,799
they know something will go wrong

654
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,760
they're not focusing on prevention

655
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,590
they're basically focusing on

656
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,299
remediation how can we fix it when

657
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,470
something goes wrong and that's a

658
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,210
mindset that

659
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,830
of us need to have and I'm not saying we

660
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,559
shouldn't try and prevent anything of

661
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:30,030
course you need prevention of course we

662
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,658
need passwords of course you need

663
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,370
firewalls of course well debate probably

664
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:39,720
you need antivirus or something like

665
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:42,600
that so prevention is a good thing but

666
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,470
you need to live with the understanding

667
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,689
that prevention will fail if it failed

668
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,400
that the NSA if it fail that Sony if it

669
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,950
failed that the list goes on

670
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,320
it will also fail at your organization

671
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,789
this is what I tell my clients are you

672
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,280
really so arrogant that you think that

673
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:01,650
you have things better than all these

674
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:05,039
other companies that got hacked no they

675
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:07,470
did everything sort of right but

676
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:11,039
prevention will fail so the real trick

677
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,510
is detection how quickly can you find

678
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,549
out that somebody is actually in your

679
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:16,620
network that somebody's actually getting

680
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:18,840
to your data and do you know what they

681
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,760
want to do so it's getting to know the

682
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,740
attacker understanding the threat if

683
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,690
you're a bank they probably want to

684
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,789
steal money if you're an energy company

685
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:31,650
well maybe they might want to try and

686
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:33,419
bring you down if you're an insurance

687
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:36,679
company well maybe they want to commit

688
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:39,090
insurance fraud so really understanding

689
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:41,190
what are what did you take is trying to

690
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,730
do so what kind of data would it be

691
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:46,409
going for so make a hypothesis if I were

692
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,059
attacking my company and I wanted to

693
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:52,110
steal content I wanted to steal the

694
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:55,139
latest car design from Toyota what would

695
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:57,658
I do how would I get in so then you can

696
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,090
actually start detecting those kind of

697
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:01,770
patterns oh I see somebody trying to

698
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,649
access that machine and trying to get to

699
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,750
that data what can I do about it because

700
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,880
that's the next question of course so

701
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,380
it's great if you detect something but

702
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,429
then the next question is what are you

703
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,970
going to do about it

704
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:16,230
so remediation response those are the

705
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,940
things that really matter and that's why

706
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:21,090
you see a lot of companies investing in

707
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,250
these days and that's basically what

708
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:26,520
this pixi tries to say we need to get

709
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:29,400
early detection because I don't know if

710
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:32,250
you are aware and normally I ask for a

711
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,500
show of hand how long do you think it

712
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,660
takes on average for a breach to be

713
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,150
detected

714
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:41,150
the average is coming down so that's the

715
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:46,429
good news but at the moment it's still

716
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:49,970
seven months seven months before the

717
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:51,950
average breach is detected so companies

718
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:55,250
go on for months without knowing that

719
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,750
somebody's in their system and that's

720
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,640
the problem if you do incident

721
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,890
remediation so you get that call we've

722
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,059
been breached and do you know what

723
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,559
happened and of course your answer is no

724
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,780
we don't know what happened so you go in

725
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,940
and you look and you go back and you

726
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,219
look at backups but then you have

727
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,440
backups maybe four or five days ago and

728
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:14,149
yes they were already in five days do

729
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,369
you have backups for seven months ago

730
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:17,960
can you figure out what happened seven

731
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:19,310
months ago and what they were doing in

732
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,699
your environment during that period

733
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:25,520
that's why that that period needs to be

734
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:27,109
reduced we need to find them as soon as

735
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,899
they enter our networks and we need to

736
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:31,699
anticipate what they're going to do

737
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:33,560
that's where we need innovation that's

738
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:36,020
where security should really focus how

739
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:41,629
can we innovate to find that out and how

740
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:44,449
can we innovate to relieve or release

741
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:46,699
the people who need to do that because

742
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:50,089
drawing more people at it is not going

743
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,230
to solve the problem because there's so

744
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,060
many things happening on your network

745
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,800
how many people do you need to monitor

746
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,719
all of that we're never going to solve

747
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,660
it by just drawing more people at it

748
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,750
we need intelligence we need data and

749
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:04,910
analytics we need automation and I'll

750
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,920
talk a little bit about those things so

751
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:09,410
these are some advisers we typically

752
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,600
give to our clients saying that hey you

753
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,940
really need to rethink and reboot your

754
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:17,839
cybersecurity approach and I'm not going

755
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:20,060
to go to all of them because it's well

756
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,340
all of them talked about for hours but

757
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,230
we we don't want to do that a couple of

758
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,859
things that play to the questions that

759
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:30,470
were asked earlier by the way the the

760
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:32,960
point in here in the in the bottom he

761
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,459
makes security everyone's job that's

762
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,650
about so many ask the question about

763
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,560
security awareness that's about

764
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:41,630
awareness everyone in the organization

765
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,450
should realize security is not something

766
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:46,760
IT does or that the security department

767
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,810
does or that as external company does

768
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,900
know security is important

769
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:54,210
cause it's my data I care about it I

770
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,990
care about it of my data gets stolen if

771
00:35:54,210 --> 00:36:00,450
the car I just designed ends up in there

772
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,850
in the hand of the competition so I need

773
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:05,310
to take the right measures but then it's

774
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:07,950
our job a security professional to train

775
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:09,810
those people and to not say you're not

776
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,720
allowed to go to the cloud or you're not

777
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,340
allowed to use with USB drives now they

778
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,589
have a need for that they need to go to

779
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,900
the cloud to basically have always

780
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:21,540
access to their data they need that USB

781
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,600
Drive to share information so we need to

782
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:28,200
give them ways to secure it in a secure

783
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:31,140
way by providing encryption for the USB

784
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:35,189
Drive by providing a secure cloud

785
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:36,509
service etc etc and by training but

786
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:40,140
you're not there if you just train

787
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:42,410
people because the questions that was

788
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,359
asked was about ok how aware are

789
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:48,270
organizations and the answer is well

790
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:50,160
that's pretty appalling I think the

791
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:54,390
example was I think it was you saying

792
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,210
that the police officers in Germany were

793
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:59,129
hit by a phishing attack and many of

794
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:01,410
them clicked well so we work with

795
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,660
companies where we do mock phishing

796
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:06,509
attacks so we will send out a phishing

797
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,069
email and if they click on it they will

798
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,870
go to a web site and say well if this

799
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,820
was a real phishing attack you would

800
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,940
have a problem so now you get a little

801
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,500
training video and that's not all what

802
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,650
we do is then a couple of months later

803
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:22,260
we do it again and in many companies you

804
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,270
see the click rate going down from I

805
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,300
don't know something like sixty percent

806
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,980
in the first email to 40 percent and

807
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:33,210
then we got these what we call serial

808
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,100
clickers people who keep clicking and we

809
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,780
drive it down and in some organizations

810
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,180
the culture is okay to do some name and

811
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:43,500
shaming to basically say hey do you know

812
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:44,940
who clicked on his email the funny story

813
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,560
about that when we did that for the

814
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,380
first time that this client we were

815
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,940
sitting in this in the area where

816
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,160
security was sitting and we said that we

817
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,470
hid sent and the email the phishing

818
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,569
campaign went out to I don't know 80,000

819
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,180
users around the world

820
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,190
five minutes later one of the security

821
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,140
guys walks in

822
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:06,380
he walks to our room and he stands like

823
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:09,618
this said I think I did something very

824
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:14,300
very stupid just now even the security

825
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:16,790
guys click on those links so and by the

826
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:19,040
way that's the best way to learn I mean

827
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:22,329
I can show you a video I can give you a

828
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,040
lecture about how you need to be secure

829
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:27,530
that moment when you click on that link

830
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,560
when your heart skips a beat because you

831
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:33,230
think oh shoot I just did something

832
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,299
wrong did I just really fall for a

833
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:38,060
phishing attack I mean that's the best

834
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,980
learning experience you can have because

835
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,078
you're probably not going to do that

836
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,680
again although we found people who keep

837
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,800
doing it so that's that's very important

838
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,640
that security awareness but I want to

839
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,310
focus on this one companies are always

840
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,430
asking us how should I spend my security

841
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:00,319
money where should I invest and

842
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:04,640
traditionally a lot of money goes in

843
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:06,880
prevention and five years ago companies

844
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,560
would spend all their money in

845
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,579
preventative technologies passwords

846
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:15,020
firewalls etc etc etc nowadays we say

847
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:17,589
it's you probably be thirty thirty

848
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:20,240
thirty or one-third one-third one-third

849
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:23,328
one-third and prevention one-third on

850
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,609
detection and one-third on remediation

851
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:28,280
and response so you got everything

852
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:31,369
covered but if you really want to do

853
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,849
smart investment you need to invest in

854
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:36,680
innovation now that goes totally against

855
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:38,750
like I explained before goes totally

856
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,328
against traditional security thinking

857
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:43,760
because innovation is bad change is bad

858
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:46,400
from a security point of view but we

859
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,800
need to invest in techniques that can

860
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,740
really help us to outmaneuver the bad

861
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,960
guys so what do i what do i mean by that

862
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:58,069
let me give you a couple of examples but

863
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,930
I do I do want to pause very briefly

864
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:04,640
when I get to this point about

865
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:07,490
innovation because I think there's one

866
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,740
important element of innovation that we

867
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:12,348
haven't addressed and it's got nothing

868
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,209
to do with technology and it was

869
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:16,280
mentioned here already

870
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,800
and I want to say it again because I'm

871
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:23,300
really really passionate about it we

872
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:27,560
need more diversity in security if you

873
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:30,020
only get guys and guys were all smart we

874
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,370
all love technology and we can think out

875
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,340
of the box and we can think like a

876
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:36,109
hacker but we need the other part of

877
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:38,750
humanity to also chip in

878
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:43,040
we need females to help us with this

879
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:46,370
challenge so it's our task all of us to

880
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:50,990
basically make sure that we can find out

881
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:54,140
why girls are not joining security at

882
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:56,600
extension we've got a target I've got

883
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:59,540
about 1,000 people in Europe working for

884
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:02,620
me and our target is to get 30% I'm

885
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,910
sorry I didn't get to 60% yet but of

886
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,970
1000 people that's gonna be a challenge

887
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:10,940
I'd love to get there I want to get to

888
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:14,270
30% females at the moment my biggest

889
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:16,700
problem is I just find I cannot find

890
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:19,390
them look at this room I mean this is

891
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,279
not enough so we're doing a lot of

892
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:25,520
investments in training going to

893
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,680
universities going to high schools to

894
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,910
start interesting females also in

895
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,370
security and I think that's something

896
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:34,399
all of us need to get involved in

897
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:36,620
because that's really really important

898
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,810
that we do that but of course there's a

899
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,060
lot of technology that we can use for

900
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:43,640
innovation as well because what do we

901
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,320
need in security what did I just talk

902
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,529
about we need security professionals

903
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:51,020
understand the threats but more

904
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,610
importantly who not only understand

905
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:56,090
technology but also understand the

906
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:58,400
business sure we can say oh you've got

907
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:02,090
all these ports on a firewall are open

908
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,400
that's a risk sure but why is it a risk

909
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:06,140
is the risk to my business is the

910
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,360
business critical information that you

911
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,480
can get to so we need to translate those

912
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,620
techy things that we understand so what

913
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,450
does it mean for the business why should

914
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,100
business actually spend money what's the

915
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,680
business risk how much money would it

916
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,240
cost if something will go wrong so we

917
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,740
need to make that translation otherwise

918
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,930
they're never gonna invest and

919
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:30,549
as I said before we need people who are

920
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:32,930
willing to work crazy hours at times

921
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:35,750
sacrifice their weekends and free nights

922
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,700
for the good course well like I said

923
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:41,030
before we cannot get enough of those

924
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,680
people so there's not enough of those

925
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,090
people around and actually throwing more

926
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,859
people at the problem there's not going

927
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,750
to solve it we also need an IT

928
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,300
department that can actually respond to

929
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,760
change very quickly if there is a threat

930
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,740
one of the big problems big corporates

931
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,800
have so yes we know there's a

932
00:42:54,740 --> 00:43:00,259
vulnerability and IT says oh yeah we put

933
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,600
it in our incident response list and

934
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:05,450
we'll deal with it in two three four

935
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,549
five six weeks well that's not good

936
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,500
enough if it's really business critical

937
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:12,500
something needs to happen so we need to

938
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:14,750
get IT to be flexible but I tease it no

939
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,520
I don't have time for that this project

940
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,730
needs to go live and this is priority

941
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,920
there's a bigger priority so don't

942
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,920
bother me with that it's a real problem

943
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,290
at many organizations and what we

944
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,000
require is lots of money because we need

945
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:30,800
more people we'll probably need to pay

946
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,840
them more to keep them interested we

947
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,300
need to pay overtime for them we need

948
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:37,700
more tools you need more technology etc

949
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,820
etc that is just not going to work

950
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:43,790
that's not available because there's not

951
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,320
enough people and you can't I'm afraid

952
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:48,050
you cannot read most of the things on

953
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:51,710
here but basically that statistic there

954
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:53,930
in green says two million the

955
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:58,640
expectation is we need two million

956
00:43:53,930 --> 00:44:00,980
security professionals by 2019 so hey if

957
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,690
you're looking for a job security is the

958
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,180
right field to be so that's the good

959
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:08,090
news the bad news is they're not out

960
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:10,779
there there are no two million security

961
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,780
professionals

962
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:17,900
available in in 2019 so we need to find

963
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:21,710
another solution we need to innovate and

964
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:23,660
use technology to change it which means

965
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:26,780
we need to start from the bottom we need

966
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:28,420
to automate IT is not going to help us

967
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,960
because they don't have time for us

968
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:33,470
they're busy

969
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,119
so we need to automate our response what

970
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,430
if you detect the threat and then

971
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,050
automatically you can change the

972
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:42,290
settings on your firewall

973
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:45,350
it's possible see one of the sponsors

974
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:48,050
here Paolo Alto Palo Alto provides very

975
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:50,089
good technology for that if you embed it

976
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,680
and combine that in your network

977
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,810
infrastructure with your analytics

978
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,970
capability you detect the threat

979
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:59,930
automatically you can basically close on

980
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:01,368
ports or you can reroute traffic to an

981
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,700
environment where you can actually study

982
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:07,700
what is happening there so automate

983
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:10,569
going up artificial intelligence because

984
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:13,609
we don't have enough people so we need

985
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:15,920
computers to actually learn what is

986
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:18,800
normal on our network what is normal

987
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,690
traffic what is abnormal traffic most

988
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,520
security breach is actually detected

989
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:25,100
because all of a sudden you see spike in

990
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:28,940
network traffic they got in and they

991
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:32,029
start exfiltrating data so just by

992
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:33,650
looking at traffic data volumes

993
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,220
sometimes you can already spot a

994
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:39,950
security breach so we've developed

995
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,930
technology that basically after a couple

996
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,759
of hours monitoring the text these are

997
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:46,240
normal patterns it's normal for this IP

998
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,650
address to talk to dead RP address the

999
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,229
traffic volumes are normally this and

1000
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:52,730
that and then all of a sudden see spike

1001
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:54,470
or all of a sudden you see this IP

1002
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:57,560
address starting to talk to an external

1003
00:45:54,470 --> 00:46:00,109
IP address well that may set off a red

1004
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,029
flag so that means that a security

1005
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:04,819
analyst who's watching a screen doesn't

1006
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:07,490
have to look at all those entries in log

1007
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,990
files but only gets flagged if there's a

1008
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:11,149
real threat if there's something really

1009
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:12,709
funny happening because we don't have

1010
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,900
enough people remember so we need to

1011
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:17,030
focus the people that we do have to the

1012
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,910
real funny stuff that's also why we need

1013
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:21,470
big data analytics going up one more we

1014
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,420
need to correlate what we see on the

1015
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:27,169
network to what's happening in the real

1016
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:28,760
world so we see network traffic going up

1017
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,369
on that IP address well that happens

1018
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,080
that IP address is where our business

1019
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:35,810
critical financial server and

1020
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:39,650
information sets so maybe that's more

1021
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:42,500
important then if it's just some public

1022
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:44,900
data so we need to correlate their data

1023
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:47,359
so we need big data so the stuffs that

1024
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,970
maybe we are a little bit nervous about

1025
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:52,090
the living services that collect a lot

1026
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:54,640
of big data about us is X

1027
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:56,530
he was going to help us in security if

1028
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,509
we understand the world around us better

1029
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:00,790
if we understand behavior of the people

1030
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,650
on a network better if you understand

1031
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:05,590
the environment and the risk in the

1032
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,540
environment better we can actually take

1033
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,610
much more measured controls and really

1034
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,110
understand what that's a risk and that

1035
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,030
yeah well something may be happening but

1036
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:15,550
that's not a priority because it's a not

1037
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:17,830
a risky area or that's actually normal

1038
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:19,630
or I can correlate it to a marketing

1039
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:22,900
campaign that we just started say yeah

1040
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:25,000
of course the volume goes up but and of

1041
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,970
course if you detect something like I

1042
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,830
said automation to say okay let's close

1043
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:32,830
these firewall ports let's reroute

1044
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:34,779
traffic let's keep the attackers busy to

1045
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:37,210
find out what they're doing use honey

1046
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:40,060
pots and and things like that is using

1047
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:42,070
deception techniques to basically start

1048
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:45,040
feeding them information that they think

1049
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:47,650
is important but it's not or have a

1050
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,120
shadow environment a mirror environment

1051
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,640
of your environment with fake

1052
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,440
information why would you want to do

1053
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,350
that because then you can get to know

1054
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,760
your attacker and if you know them you

1055
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:00,819
can probably predict what they're going

1056
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,010
to do and you can prepare better so

1057
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:04,750
these are all innovations that we should

1058
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,090
embrace and these are just some examples

1059
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,250
are just taking some random pictures and

1060
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:11,500
I'd love to go in detail on any of these

1061
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,570
problem is I can't because I don't have

1062
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,910
all that detail knowledge about those

1063
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:17,590
tools this is a picture from a company

1064
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:20,410
that we recently acquired called AI

1065
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:22,660
defense and AI defense basically brings

1066
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,870
together trap intelligence and puts it

1067
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,580
in a graphical way I mean as security

1068
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,759
professionals were all used to look at

1069
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,410
log files and many data entries but

1070
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,290
actually using big data analytics

1071
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:37,690
technology putting graphical information

1072
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:40,000
on a screen things that you can click on

1073
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:42,220
so basically what you see here you see

1074
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,530
that the bright green on top is a

1075
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,509
vulnerability and then you can actually

1076
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:48,550
click on it and see what it's related to

1077
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:51,190
a malware family and if you click on

1078
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:52,930
that malware family will say which

1079
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:54,790
systems were impacted by that malware

1080
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,440
family and you can't keep clicking and

1081
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:58,450
get much more information so you can

1082
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,880
really find out what's happening in my

1083
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:03,310
network and what should I do next where

1084
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,039
should I care about and so it's just a

1085
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:07,828
creative in a very

1086
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,049
way of putting all the data because

1087
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:11,999
there's a huge database behind it in a

1088
00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:13,799
very easily accessible way that you can

1089
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:15,299
just keep clicking true and find out

1090
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:16,079
more information easily at your

1091
00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:19,369
fingertips

1092
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:22,319
this is another graphical representation

1093
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:23,880
that's one of the benefits of a large

1094
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,380
company like Accenture where we don't

1095
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,569
only have security but we also have

1096
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,189
people who do a lot of data analytics

1097
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:31,349
we've got this whole Big Data practice

1098
00:49:29,189 --> 00:49:34,109
so we are some guys from our Big Data

1099
00:49:31,349 --> 00:49:36,569
practice look at the security data how

1100
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:38,819
would you deal with it and they throw it

1101
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:40,679
in a database they throw graph graphical

1102
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:43,049
information at it and they come up with

1103
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:46,049
something like this so what you see here

1104
00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:48,509
every dot is a node is an IP address and

1105
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:50,279
the ring in the middle is basically the

1106
00:49:48,509 --> 00:49:52,499
perimeter of the organization we were

1107
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:54,269
dealing with here so all the blue lines

1108
00:49:52,499 --> 00:49:57,598
are just connections from one IP address

1109
00:49:54,269 --> 00:50:00,328
to another from a client to a server

1110
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,219
that's all fine that's aboveboard but

1111
00:50:00,329 --> 00:50:05,219
then we see a lot of things going to the

1112
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:07,099
middle which is the external world two

1113
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:10,380
IP addresses that we don't know

1114
00:50:07,099 --> 00:50:12,179
potentially a fraudulent so rather than

1115
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,099
saying seeing a lot of lines in a log

1116
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:17,219
file or on a screen or seeing a lot of

1117
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:19,499
alerts for an analyst you can just click

1118
00:50:17,219 --> 00:50:22,199
on those blue things on those red lines

1119
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:25,319
and see what is this what IP addresses

1120
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:27,390
this is a known bad actor should I do

1121
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:29,189
something about it so it focuses really

1122
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,618
your investigation

1123
00:50:29,189 --> 00:50:33,089
so that's another way of using

1124
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:34,939
innovation to get closer this is a

1125
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:37,739
complex picture that I stole from

1126
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:40,529
pivotal one of our partners that we work

1127
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:42,269
with and I use this picture for two

1128
00:50:40,529 --> 00:50:44,519
reason it's I don't have time to really

1129
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:46,919
go through it but basically you see a

1130
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:51,269
scheme with an attacker who basically

1131
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:53,158
gets to a critical assets here and then

1132
00:50:51,269 --> 00:50:55,140
we create some phantom critical assets

1133
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:56,849
the deception let's feed them

1134
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,429
information that is not true but also

1135
00:50:56,849 --> 00:51:02,339
study what they're doing and feed that

1136
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:04,619
information back here into an analytics

1137
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:06,150
platform and into what we call security

1138
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:08,699
orchestration that's where that

1139
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:10,439
automation comes in let's Ryoka straight

1140
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:13,019
my security so I've now found out

1141
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:14,999
somebody's in my network is looking for

1142
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:17,098
those critical assets I'll keep them

1143
00:51:14,999 --> 00:51:18,359
busy in the shared environment and in

1144
00:51:17,099 --> 00:51:20,700
the meantime I've

1145
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:23,910
the information back to my firewalls my

1146
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:27,330
alert systems etc and block off the

1147
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:29,640
trajectory to my real critical assets

1148
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:33,150
and give them free rein and keep them

1149
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,770
busy and basically waste that time so

1150
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,420
yes they're in but they can't do any

1151
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,520
harm and I can study them and really

1152
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,900
find out what they're doing so more and

1153
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,759
more of these innovation and

1154
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,700
technologies are becoming available and

1155
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,440
we need to use them because again

1156
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:49,109
there's not enough of us to take out

1157
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,970
everything manually but there's more

1158
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:52,800
there's so much more which I cannot talk

1159
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,509
about it at this point pony time

1160
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,190
Internet of Things the question was

1161
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:58,350
already asked what about the Internet of

1162
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,690
Things we're doing a lot of work in the

1163
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:03,450
Internet of Things all of our clients

1164
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:06,750
are in the Internet of Things energy

1165
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:09,660
clients manufacturing clients I was at

1166
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:11,940
I'm from Amsterdam so last Friday I was

1167
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:15,690
talking to the CIO of Heineken one of my

1168
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:18,810
favorite companies of course five years

1169
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:22,470
ago he would always say Flores will be a

1170
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:25,110
brewer we're not a bank I don't care

1171
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:27,750
about security on Friday he said to me

1172
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:30,600
Flores I'm really really worried about

1173
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:32,280
my IOT environment because all of our

1174
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,370
factories are getting connected and what

1175
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,980
if people break into that so security is

1176
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:40,350
important for any company and IOT is

1177
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:42,510
playing a big role there so yes we need

1178
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:45,210
to do a lot in that area and Accenture

1179
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:47,970
is investing a lot and I've got several

1180
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:49,320
people who are focusing purely on IOT

1181
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,540
because we need to tackle that it's

1182
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:56,100
probably problem number one for many

1183
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:58,890
organizations at the moment code

1184
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:02,400
scanning the biggest thing that is still

1185
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:05,310
going wrong is we keep writing crappy

1186
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,740
code and there's no way that you can

1187
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:10,380
keep educating developers because they

1188
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:13,350
they still keep taking shortcuts and

1189
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:16,020
doing things wrong so again let's

1190
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:20,279
automate it what have you write code and

1191
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:23,790
every night you submit your code to the

1192
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:26,640
database to get compiled etc that

1193
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:30,509
automatically scans not just for

1194
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,390
functionality but also for for crappy

1195
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,580
code

1196
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:36,970
the tools are there the technology is

1197
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:39,130
there so many of our clients we are

1198
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:41,080
basically implementing that as part of

1199
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:44,110
their DevOps that automatically as soon

1200
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:46,509
as you rewrite your code it's

1201
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:49,450
automatically tested for security bugs

1202
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:52,480
and it's not that hard because if you

1203
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:54,669
look at the overall top ten but still

1204
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,850
the same things have been in the top ten

1205
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:59,260
for I don't know 15 years or so we still

1206
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:02,259
make the same mistakes

1207
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:04,330
well let's not allow programmers coders

1208
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:06,130
to make those mistakes let make

1209
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:07,690
automated monitoring that will tell them

1210
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:10,600
hey you're doing it again

1211
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:12,310
I fixed it by the way you need to tell

1212
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:16,750
them because you need to edit educate

1213
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:18,670
them and then smart monitoring and

1214
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:21,580
virtualization because I spoke about the

1215
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:23,230
Internet of Things but in the industrial

1216
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:25,690
environment like I said before you

1217
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:27,540
cannot touch those devices so let's put

1218
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:29,890
a virtual layer in front of them and

1219
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,529
monitor what's going on so there's all

1220
00:54:29,890 --> 00:54:35,319
kinds of innovation that we can apply

1221
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:38,260
there with that I'd like to wrap up yes

1222
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,150
we live in a world of opportunity I'm

1223
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:42,100
very bullish I love technology I love

1224
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:44,320
the way the world is changing I love how

1225
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:46,750
technology is impacting my life I fully

1226
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,940
embrace digital services and living

1227
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:52,120
services and yes I know there's security

1228
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:54,700
risk but I think it's up to us and again

1229
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:56,740
that's why security is so important not

1230
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,810
just because it's cool but we can

1231
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:02,529
actually help to make the world more

1232
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:06,430
secure and basically allow the world to

1233
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:07,810
change and progress so it's a great role

1234
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:10,089
that we have this great job and

1235
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:12,340
hopefully it doesn't mean we have to end

1236
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:16,480
up looking something like this we can

1237
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:18,430
just stay on normal self so with that I

1238
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,590
like to thank you I don't know if this

1239
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:22,980
time for questions I'm happy to take any

1240
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,980
questions

1241
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,800
thank you very much flurries Vanden duel

1242
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:41,950
did I say correctly sounds very good

1243
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:45,160
thank you and do you have any questions

1244
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:50,799
Flores was like oh perfect that's what I

1245
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:53,740
like first participation a question to

1246
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:57,280
the Netflix Casey did you told her is it

1247
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:59,080
in-house company yes and they've even

1248
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,790
gone further so they started with what

1249
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,190
they called chaos monkey and then they

1250
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:05,590
had chaos gorilla that is not just

1251
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:08,619
taking down systems but total data

1252
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:11,410
centers and its internal business unit

1253
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:13,990
or team within an F and I've automated

1254
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:16,359
part of that as well this was the only

1255
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:23,830
chop they helped that's that's her only

1256
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:25,410
job yes while you're interested any more

1257
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:32,640
questions

1258
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:40,180
come on yes thank you

1259
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:44,500
hi a half - any advice for those who do

1260
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:50,890
not know anything about this to avoid

1261
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:53,230
the death of the personal data so do I

1262
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:55,690
have advice for users who don't know

1263
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:57,880
anything about it so my mother and my

1264
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:59,109
father basically people like that how

1265
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,480
can they deal with their personal day

1266
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:02,859
well it's a very difficult question and

1267
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,810
put a very good question because I think

1268
00:57:02,859 --> 00:57:07,420
one of that's one of the big problems of

1269
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:10,660
society these days I mean so yes we are

1270
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:13,150
aware and we still make mistakes but if

1271
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:17,080
I look at my father my mother they have

1272
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:18,790
a computer they're on Facebook it's very

1273
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,130
difficult to explain to them you should

1274
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:23,619
do this you should do that so yes I

1275
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:25,990
think all of us can participate so I

1276
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:29,050
would basically say I mean I'm in the

1277
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:31,560
Netherlands one of the founders of what

1278
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:34,359
we call the the safe internet foundation

1279
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:37,299
providing training and awareness for for

1280
00:57:34,359 --> 00:57:38,380
people with some government sponsoring

1281
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:40,119
because I think there's a role for the

1282
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,910
government but I think there's a role

1283
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:44,040
for banks there's a role for telcos and

1284
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:45,839
as a role for all of

1285
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:49,230
so if you want to give back to society

1286
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:51,270
and into the community go to primary

1287
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,530
school and teach these these kids

1288
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:56,250
because let's start with those kids

1289
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:58,619
maybe my parents generation is lost for

1290
00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:00,960
that but let's start with these little

1291
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:02,609
kids and train them so I think all of us

1292
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,220
can play a role so there's not like I've

1293
00:58:02,609 --> 00:58:06,509
got five tips that will solve the

1294
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,509
problem because I don't think it's that

1295
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:11,070
simple

1296
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:12,690
thank you por cierto como te llamas

1297
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:15,450

you've part you attended both

1301
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,759
conferences you've asked two questions

1302
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:27,540
and thank you very much for your inputs

1303
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:32,390
and Danielle both conferences and he

1304
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,390
asked twice before and now so it's like

1305
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:46,440
well tell you Danielle venti one onions

1306
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:49,368
21 any other questions please hello good

1307
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:52,200
afternoon I'd like to ask you a question

1308
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:54,450
in line with what has just been asked by

1309
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:58,350
the previous sky but it's user level

1310
00:58:54,450 --> 00:59:02,430
what can we do for example in relation

1311
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:04,680
to IOT the Internet of Things how can we

1312
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:06,419
make sure that our own security is

1313
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,220
secure how can we improve our own

1314
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:11,150
security when you mean us you mean

1315
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:14,069
professionals or users no I mean users

1316
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:16,350
amateur users or even professionals in

1317
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:20,609
which way can we improve our own

1318
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:23,900
security scan improve the security of

1319
00:59:20,609 --> 00:59:28,799
their self of the Internet of Things

1320
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:30,090
it's one of them well I guess and you

1321
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,150
mean when you say Internet of Things

1322
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:34,680
it's the the more consumer device it's

1323
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:38,460
not the industrial Internet of Things

1324
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,779
yeah like a consumer step one I guess as

1325
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:42,840
we all know it's changed the bloody

1326
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:44,970
password if there's a parcel owner

1327
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,920
because I mean the thing that happened

1328
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:50,279
with the with the cameras it's just

1329
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:52,020
standard password so but I think we and

1330
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:55,109
again users can help a we together

1331
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:57,870
should force the producers of those

1332
00:59:55,109 --> 01:00:00,000
devices to provide an instruction

1333
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:01,710
to say this is a device these are the

1334
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,920
risk this is what you as a consumer

1335
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:06,390
should do to make it more secure but

1336
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:10,290
again in the end if you've got a

1337
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:12,299
security camera and you install it or

1338
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:13,950
you care about it can I get access to it

1339
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,260
through the internet and many people

1340
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:18,419
never think about security and there's a

1341
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:21,090
lot they can do but I think it's up to

1342
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:23,280
the producer the the manufacturer to

1343
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:25,170
provide a list and say hey these are our

1344
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:30,270
recommendations to make it secure and

1345
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:31,890
maybe telcos and I've discussed this

1346
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:33,950
with telcos and I know some of them are

1347
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:37,049
thinking about it it could offer a

1348
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:39,029
scanning service to say we'll scan your

1349
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:42,030
environment for you and we'll notify you

1350
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:43,770
if there's something does not secure and

1351
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:46,170
we can help you to make it secure the

1352
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,670
problem of course your telcos is well

1353
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:49,890
they are for profit they want to make

1354
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:52,020
money so who's gonna pay for that in the

1355
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:54,960
end it's all about money who's gonna pay

1356
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:58,670
for those things and who's gonna pay for

1357
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,670
those things in the end you and I have

1358
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:08,550
any where questions hi there imagine you

1359
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:10,170
you mentioned your desire for more

1360
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:10,770
gender diversity which i think is

1361
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,660
fantastic

1362
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:14,640
but you also mentioned that what you

1363
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,890
want to kind of people who will work

1364
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,770
overtime late sometimes work on weekends

1365
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:22,350
be on call and so on and do you think

1366
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:23,880
there's a contradictory yes it is and

1367
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:25,710
that's why I said that's what we need

1368
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:28,680
but that's not what we want

1369
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:30,630
so if you try to solve the problem with

1370
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:32,430
people you need people want to work

1371
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,200
crazy hours that said and that's why I

1372
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:37,080
said that's not going to work especially

1373
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,299
if you want females not that they don't

1374
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:43,620
want to work but then we go work-life

1375
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:46,080
balance to mix so we need to make sure

1376
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,069
that we can find clip more clever ways

1377
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,960
to do it and that's why we need

1378
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:51,210
innovation and technology so that was my

1379
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:54,060
point I wasn't trying to say I want all

1380
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:55,920
of you to work crazy hours that's

1381
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:57,900
basically where we are today we have to

1382
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,300
work crazy hours but we need to get

1383
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,620
smarter and use technology to do the

1384
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:03,930
crazy stuff for us

1385
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:05,520
so that we can sure you always get a

1386
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:07,379
call on the weekend saying hey we've

1387
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,150
been breached I mean there's no stopping

1388
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:10,710
that that's always going to happen but

1389
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:11,710
at least it should be technology that

1390
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:13,030
makes that call

1391
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,619
and not someone else who needs to

1392
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:16,829
sacrifice that weekend so that was my

1393
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:16,829
point

1394
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:23,400
any more questions

1395
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:29,049
we have two we have Flores here so we

1396
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:36,460
have to ask him if you're interested in

1397
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:39,790
and he's something else nope okay so big

1398
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:42,970
applause for Flores bond and dog alpha

1399
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:45,609
Center thank you for the top information
