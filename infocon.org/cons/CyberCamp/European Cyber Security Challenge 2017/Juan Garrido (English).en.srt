1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,059
when I saw that a woman good afternoon

2
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,059
everyone

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:25,849
sorry that I kept you waiting there were

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:29,400
a few technical problems with my

5
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:32,278
computer which was not connecting

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,059
properly so we have had to change the

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:40,710
computer and for the demo let's see how

8
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,900
we're going to be handling it but this

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,340
is going to be my presentation which is

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:51,839
about asset auditing mine in Azuri my

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:59,160
name is huang Garrido everybody knows me

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:06,810
as Juanito and my presentation is to see

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:10,530
how we can do pen testing on the azure

14
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,340
platform in the UK and the u.s. they do

15
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:19,229
a lot of bill review to configure it a

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,860
structure and then the auditor is in

17
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:26,580
charge of seeing if the platform is

18
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:29,849
properly made this is not work of

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,300
hawkers hackers but of auditors as you

20
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:35,160
will see throughout my presentation and

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:43,410
it is because the main and manufacturers

22
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:50,789
such as Amazon Google Microsoft my ears

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:57,509
are too big they have they are in charge

24
00:01:50,789 --> 00:02:02,459
of the back in work and throughout

25
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:07,110
history of the cloud there's not a lot

26
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:09,840
of errors related to the core

27
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,260
infrastructure if you had read articles

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,810
on the Internet related to cloud which

29
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,940
is quite in fashion at the moment

30
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,489
because of the Internet of Things for

31
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,859
example

32
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:27,209
the attacks made to that infrastructure

33
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,430
has to do with the rejection of services

34
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,909
and not so much with the core of the

35
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,489
platform nowadays there are two or three

36
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:39,810
attacks that I am aware of in relation

37
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,810
to the platform so the one of the

38
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,780
questions that I would like to ask is

39
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,340
have you worked with cloud can you raise

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,299
your hands those who have worked with

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:56,700
cloud one two three one that has raced

42
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,409
but then has put the hand down so I

43
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,888
won't be counting that so it's just

44
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:05,090
three Angelina Jolie do you know

45
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:07,920
Angelina Jolie please raise your hand

46
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:11,819
so those three have raised the hands are

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:16,920
free the only three that have managed

48
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:19,440
worked with cloud those who haven't

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,690
handled cloud the seat very these

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,299
sentence which is very famous which it

51
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:30,269
says there is no cloud it's just someone

52
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:32,849
else's computer so we are going to admin

53
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:38,220
the infrastructure provided by

54
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:40,948
manufacturer so the cloud is the

55
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,319
isolation of a platform that can be

56
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:47,299
provided by any manufacturer because

57
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:53,849
there's many of them who work with cloud

58
00:03:47,299 --> 00:04:00,000
and as platform admin we forget about

59
00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:05,370
the chaos that is doing a zip PD which

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,010
you need wires you need cables you need

61
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:15,650
regulation people to do the admin you

62
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:18,829
need to change the

63
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:25,070
the RAM and the disk and that

64
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:28,099
infrastructure costs money it is done by

65
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,450
the company in relation to when they

66
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,470
want to work with the internet so the

67
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:36,560
cloud comes when the manufacturer or the

68
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:41,780
company any size they forget about that

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,390
cost about that large cost and they give

70
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,190
you the platform themselves so they give

71
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:50,210
you the license and what you have to do

72
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:55,790
is to publish your service and that's it

73
00:04:50,210 --> 00:05:00,799
so that would be the fastest definition

74
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:03,950
of cloud however there are also errors

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,620
in cloud regard infrastructure and

76
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,650
there's a lot of topics to cover there's

77
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,960
a lot of challenges on the IT side and

78
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:17,890
on the security side which have to be

79
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:23,539
covered with cloud for example

80
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:28,479
information at a legal level as part of

81
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,480
the security team I can analyze I

82
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:41,320
website server Linux Windows and I it's

83
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:45,170
not really important for me to have that

84
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:53,200
location of that service but on a legal

85
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:55,970
level yes yeah for companies to know

86
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,330
where the data is going to be stored

87
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,540
it's important that the data protection

88
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:06,109
law here in Spain forces you to have the

89
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:12,230
data controlled in the European Union so

90
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:14,510
the manufacturer has to have the

91
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,750
provider for example in this case Azure

92
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:20,870
Microsoft they have to guarantee that

93
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,150
the data is being stored in the

94
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,580
geographical location so with Desura

95
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,679
Amazon will go they offer several

96
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,650
geographical locations where you are

97
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,099
going to be able to have your data

98
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:36,688
regarding maintenance they are safe

99
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:40,050
infrastructures this doesn't change the

100
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:43,830
only thing is that the cost of physical

101
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:47,219
infrastructure we do not work with this

102
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,349
this it has to with the operator where

103
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:52,590
their provider with add sewer so in this

104
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:59,759
case it would be Microsoft so Microsoft

105
00:06:52,590 --> 00:07:03,330
would be in charge of where all the SQL

106
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:09,330
or from Oracle or everything is secure

107
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:12,840
so this is in the hands of Microsoft if

108
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:17,068
I have to have one to have 40 virtual

109
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,650
machines in 2012 for example those

110
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:23,099
spiritual machines were and they are

111
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,289
deployed I can have 200 virtual machines

112
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:28,259
and those 200 per two machines are going

113
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:31,039
to be plugged with the latest patch this

114
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,870
would be in the hands of Microsoft

115
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:37,469
regarding security more or less the same

116
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:41,039
it's about 50/50 Microsoft is in charge

117
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:44,159
of having a good Network and that is the

118
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,259
city's Pro segments are okay that you

119
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:50,250
don't act cannot go to different

120
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:52,199
countries and has to answer to incidents

121
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,560
it's again 5050

122
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:59,250
I have my infrastructure in Azura I have

123
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,770
200 virtual machines and 400 SQL

124
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:05,759
instances all around the world and I do

125
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:09,419
not control if for example I have a user

126
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,810
which is authenticating and SQL in Spain

127
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:15,870
in Malaga and have another user which is

128
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,029
also doing the same from China with when

129
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,460
I do not have any user from China so in

130
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:24,449
my company there is no anybody working

131
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,359
in China at that given moment so in the

132
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:30,810
things that I have to do is having the

133
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,990
mechanisms which are adequate to monitor

134
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,270
all this and within Microsoft within the

135
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,089
cloud with

136
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,819
the manufacturer and they would have to

137
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:44,180
be in charge of having the necessary

138
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,990
tools in order to carry out these tasks

139
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:50,510
so in regarding the cloud it would be

140
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:55,279
50/50 regarding trends you have this

141
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:57,500
graph this is between 2016 2017 as you

142
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,459
can see the large companies they have

143
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:05,120
Azur and Amazon and then at a residual

144
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:07,430
level this ittle digitalocean IBM who

145
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,940
also have a cloud platform Google Cloud

146
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:13,819
which is oriented to their own tools

147
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:20,660
there is not so much flexibility in

148
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:24,080
comparison to Amazon or a Microsoft and

149
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,600
when with SMEs if the trend is still

150
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:33,380
it's also going up so Azure and Amazon

151
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:38,390
are the two that tend to be used the

152
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:40,430
most in the market about the

153
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:44,420
architecture of Azure it's not very

154
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:48,649
different to the one from Amazon as I

155
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,930
have said before it's 50/50 on the

156
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:54,200
asuras size they're going to admin the

157
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:56,959
whole platform according to what you

158
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:01,579
have in your contract and then within

159
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:06,969
your reach you try to do the things as

160
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:09,920
best as possible because they monitor

161
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:14,329
the actions that you are going to be

162
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:18,050
undertaken oh the clouds are going to

163
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:21,229
monitor all the traffic coming towards

164
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:24,890
the inside and I say customer we have

165
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:28,520
the opportunity of taking the admin of

166
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:31,220
the whole platform just by a simple

167
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,500
click that's the same as with an Amazon

168
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,529
or any other clouds so the manufacturer

169
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,380
also gives you access to AP I swear you

170
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:44,110
can connect yourself and you can expand

171
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,110
the platform according to your needs

172
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,960
and regarding the models

173
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,620
they are not this Azure is not very

174
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,300
different to what amazon is offering

175
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,580
there's one called

176
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:02,030
on-premise which gives you all the

177
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,400
possibilities and they say is that

178
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,740
there's a data center in Switzer that is

179
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,020
a data center in Switzerland for all you

180
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:13,010
and with this data center you're going

181
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:16,760
to be able to create to delete to do

182
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:19,660
anything from that Center and then these

183
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:25,670
the infrastructure as a service and

184
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:28,790
Azure has got with oh the Thea area were

185
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:37,610
putting all the machines the RAF the

186
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:40,550
firewalls and then you do the admin of

187
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:43,820
the other data of the applications of

188
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:47,930
the operative system oh the network and

189
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:50,990
all this is done from layer seven and

190
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:55,219
then we have the platform as a service

191
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:58,700
and as Ora gives you everything they do

192
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:01,820
the admin of the whole platform and also

193
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:05,290
the electric electrical part of the

194
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:10,880
network and they give you as a small app

195
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:14,290
where you can create a website or an SQL

196
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,050
etc so there is a very basic

197
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,819
administration tool which is going to

198
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,949
allow you to do little things in the

199
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,710
platform but what you're going to need

200
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:27,770
according to your service to services

201
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:31,970
because this is a paper service as any

202
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:34,850
other cloud I want 40 SQL so each SQL

203
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:39,680
it's going to be two or three power Mets

204
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:44,210
so this is the architecture person who

205
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,189
is going to determine if well in this

206
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,650
case how many databases are going to be

207
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,030
needed and finally software as a service

208
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,670
when the way they provide everything

209
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:55,640
they manage absolutely everything and

210
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,979
you have a small admin portal where

211
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,810
you're going to do be able to do little

212
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,730
things of would our service

213
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:05,579
could be summarized if tomorrow if I

214
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,010
have want to create a website and for it

215
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:11,040
to be available I don't have to worry

216
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:13,439
about how many SQL insistance

217
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,939
instances are needed by Oracle and I'm

218
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,000
not going to have the arming nor for

219
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,730
what is going to be done by Microsoft or

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
a0 or whoever so it's a small portal

221
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,560
where basically you have an assistant

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,600
it's a weapon system who is going to

223
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,349
tell you well if I need to create a

224
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:36,390
website what is it going to do PHP GA

225
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:40,860
JSP PHP ok do you want in backup Linux

226
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:43,830
Linux for example do you know how many

227
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:48,420
SQL instances sorry am I going to need

228
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:50,010
or do I just do an I guess

229
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:54,140
well you have an assistant there and

230
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:58,760
then quite rapidly you have a website

231
00:13:54,140 --> 00:14:01,770
without the added problems of design

232
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:07,910
planification architecture for it to

233
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:07,910
work etc we're going to focus here

234
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:18,180
because it's where we can cover more

235
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,840
topics and this is the scenario that I

236
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,760
have in my head of my computer

237
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,630
but I'm going to try to do it with this

238
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,630
computer that I'm using now it's a

239
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:33,120
classic version of Azur along with a

240
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:37,200
modern version of a sewer and this is

241
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:42,420
the scenario that we have currently I

242
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:45,360
have a virtual machine routing rules I

243
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,430
have a lot of elements created and in

244
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,360
the new platform which is called Ibiza

245
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,620
platform

246
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:56,240
I have virtual machines

247
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:56,240
I have SQL

248
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:03,500
a lot of information information I have

249
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:09,110
machines that are patched or those that

250
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:11,380
are not etc this image that you can see

251
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,630
here is a problem that I came across

252
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,600
about around one or two years ago I

253
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,580
can't remember when I started working

254
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,560
with the Azure platform

255
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:27,080
I was asked for for an auditing I had to

256
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,540
decline because I had no idea what I was

257
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:32,840
doing I don't know if you have seen the

258
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,930
joke about the dock which is on the

259
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:38,210
portable conv laptop and he says I don't

260
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,569
know what I'm doing or the monkey from

261
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:44,480
The Simpsons who is doing like this and

262
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,120
two years ago I felt like this it was

263
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,280
like the dock on the laptop with no idea

264
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,170
what he was doing and about Homer

265
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,180
Simpson and when he was at when he's

266
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,219
asked about something then he doesn't

267
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:03,439
know and then you see the image of the

268
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:06,890
monkey so I once started with Azure with

269
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:11,780
a server that I've got a home and I was

270
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:16,580
doing some testing with BitTorrent and

271
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:19,610
it was just doing testing so I connected

272
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,860
to the via panel Azur I had I didn't

273
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,590
know it was happening and I connected

274
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,920
from an endpoint a home where all the

275
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,810
traffic from all the services of my home

276
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,479
come and then we happened was from the

277
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,099
service so these routed to Azure and

278
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,360
there was a monitor and as always send

279
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:43,520
me an email after two hours of having

280
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:46,580
done this and I was really really

281
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:49,670
frightened you're not going to be able

282
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,380
to see here because it's too far but the

283
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,010
message was saying that you're going to

284
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,660
be reported because you are downloaded a

285
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:59,360
content which for them is illegal and

286
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,589
what they said is either you take it out

287
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,870
of our platform all we're going to

288
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:07,699
demand you and I'm going to report you

289
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:09,438
so I switched off all

290
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,980
servus I'll switch everything off and

291
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,860
then I got another email because then

292
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,709
the traffic is stasis arrested you in

293
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:20,658
the in Azura and again I had another

294
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,669
email saying that they were going to

295
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:28,549
report me because I hadn't deleted the

296
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:31,549
traffic so in the end I had to start

297
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:33,260
sending emails to Microsoft and to

298
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:38,570
Asura's saying that I was just doing

299
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:45,408
some testing and in the end nothing

300
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:48,678
happened but basically after this Azur

301
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:52,850
has got two or three administration

302
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,919
portals with one of them they do the

303
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,439
admin of the subscription how much you

304
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,840
have spent in the platform and how much

305
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,929
the platform is costing you you have an

306
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,320
old portal of azure which is quite old

307
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:09,500
and another one which is quite new which

308
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,870
is called Ibiza portal so there are

309
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,179
three platforms but they are going to

310
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:20,658
Trevor trying to put it all into one

311
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:23,350
which is called the Ibiza portal these

312
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:28,130
are the ones that you have on the slide

313
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:31,689
on the classic platform which is when

314
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:34,880
azure started providing these services

315
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,039
well they have a lot of active

316
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,889
directories and on the base and then

317
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,779
above that you can do admin for whatever

318
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:44,928
you want when you buy service in Azure

319
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:47,720
Microsoft provides you with an Active

320
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:50,980
Directory and then there you can build

321
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,990
your company on the Internet

322
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:58,700
what happened was is that that kept on

323
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:00,820
growing and growing and the level was

324
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,260
not enough for the old part and in

325
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,139
parallel they started to create a new

326
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:10,580
portal with improvements and the

327
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:14,149
provements where for example the old as

328
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:16,439
your platform there was not management

329
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:20,159
of the users of the

330
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,980
of the role users so you could all

331
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,750
either be a user or a reader of the

332
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:30,720
platform so when you have a gigantic

333
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:32,460
platform if you consider that into a

334
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,280
thousand servers and a thousand

335
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,810
databases when you want to do when you

336
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,420
want to do auditing it's it's very

337
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:42,960
difficult and it was very difficult back

338
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:45,210
then for a company to having having to

339
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,780
define a scope imagine a company here in

340
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:51,900
Malaga who has four offices around the

341
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,780
world if an auditing is done in the

342
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,270
service in Australia with the old portal

343
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,330
of azure you have to provide access to

344
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:03,150
the whole platform so that the auditor

345
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,460
could carry out his work so that wasn't

346
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:10,230
the correct thing to do with so with the

347
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:15,540
new portal you have an improvement in

348
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:20,850
the management of users then we have

349
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:23,790
endpoints this are for people regarding

350
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,800
in the legal area for example here in

351
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,710
Spain we have the national scheme of

352
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:32,040
security we have the data protection law

353
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:34,080
and then they start saying okay where is

354
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:38,790
your data where does it come from

355
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:43,740
where are your computers how do you do

356
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:45,570
the backup of the information and many

357
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,140
of them didn't know what to say

358
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:52,530
and here is the answer for Amazon for

359
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:56,750
Google services for as you are they

360
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:59,460
provide you with series of endpoints to

361
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:04,910
know where the data is going to come in

362
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,910
and come out so in this area the legal

363
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:13,230
elements can build better services so

364
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:16,410
that people in the sales department can

365
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:19,140
sell the product much better for example

366
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:21,210
for public administration which has to

367
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,780
follow a series of regulations and

368
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:26,310
procedures or it is for a private

369
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,930
company which follows different

370
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:33,179
regulations and different

371
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:37,620
so microphone microsoft offers series of

372
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:40,230
endpoints and you can see there's no

373
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:44,429
zoom so I kind of put this bigger for

374
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:46,260
the Zurich Lao a login is different if

375
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:50,010
you're going to do the logging in

376
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:52,920
Germany or in the part of government

377
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:56,700
which is a an area which is Hori nted

378
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:58,920
more towards the United States that for

379
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,810
the global government is just for the

380
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:07,440
United States of America

381
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:11,639
then in Azur we have the identifier of

382
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,760
the user of the client because you are

383
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,700
renting the platform so basically when

384
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:21,120
we deploy something in Azure on where we

385
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:25,950
deploy something in Amazon or in Google

386
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:30,360
Cloud we must not forget that in the end

387
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:34,920
what we are doing is if you forget about

388
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:36,270
the cloud and you have the machine in

389
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,600
the end and with the series of services

390
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:41,940
you're going to have a machine where

391
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,770
you're going to have several users at

392
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,080
the same time a user from China

393
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:51,270
Yousef from Germany from Spain from the

394
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:56,490
United States so for manufacturers they

395
00:22:51,270 --> 00:23:00,420
need to be able to get all the users

396
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:04,260
using that platform so that then we

397
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:06,360
login in the platform or if they do it

398
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:12,720
virtual way it can be almost impossible

399
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:17,590
to come out of that niche so in Azur you

400
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,720
are identified with a number with

401
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,340
like a rent a number of rental number

402
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,140
and that's where you're going to be able

403
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:28,600
to administrate all your data so you

404
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:34,690
have a login which is the one that you

405
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:41,699
have here at the bottom okay I just like

406
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:41,700
to switch it's over here

407
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:59,710
thank you for example I'd like to show

408
00:23:46,090 --> 00:24:02,370
you from the two portals this would be a

409
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,370
new portal

410
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:31,928
since we're running behind schedule I

411
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:35,139
don't want to say too much time so this

412
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:37,270
would be the use of portal you can see

413
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,200
that on this side all the resources that

414
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:43,270
we could have on the platform as I

415
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,850
mentioned before I've got various

416
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:53,379
devices Linux 4 or 5 2008 servers and

417
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:56,168
2012 server part of network electronics

418
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:59,890
also so they're very networked devices

419
00:24:56,169 --> 00:25:02,080
that are used to direct traffic from one

420
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:08,679
machine to another and also from one

421
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:10,720
machine to internet that's just to

422
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:22,090
visualize this in terms of the Active

423
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:27,580
Directory it's a bit the same these are

424
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:28,899
all my users and all my groups and I'm

425
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,510
going to configure everything directly

426
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:36,700
from the platform if I wanted to

427
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:39,490
generate a new virtual device you can

428
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:44,860
see them there's these small assistants

429
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:48,960
here and these assistants explain what

430
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,959
they need Linux Windows whatever

431
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,909
so as you can see there on the right

432
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,860
this is basically the result I can have

433
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,200
different directories or different

434
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:09,209
instances within the same platform and

435
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,770
depending on the instance were unlocated

436
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,910
which is what you can see at the bottom

437
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:20,750
directory directly on that directory

438
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:30,270
I'm able to integrate configure or add

439
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:40,620
different options could we switch back

440
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:43,050
to the presentation please great okay so

441
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:50,610
that's been what I wanted to say about

442
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:53,220
Azure in terms of risks obviously the

443
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,560
platform's not risk free you can install

444
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,040
what you want but if you want to install

445
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:01,800
it for sql's and those as girls not

446
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,560
fortified at network level or a database

447
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:07,950
and front-end application of that

448
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,629
front-end maybe is B or whatever you're

449
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,570
using at the front-end well this may be

450
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:18,630
vulnerable to attacks and the

451
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:21,510
application will be SQL injection that's

452
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:24,380
the only difference really then in terms

453
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:28,350
of virtual machines it's a bit the same

454
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:33,380
do for reasons of compliance you may be

455
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:36,419
forced to ensure that your machines are

456
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,350
encrypted in the cloud in the case of

457
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:45,080
virtual machines in this case Microsoft

458
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:47,790
well we'd have BitLocker encryption

459
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:51,230
platform that we use but Microsoft will

460
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:51,230
provide support BitLocker

461
00:27:51,380 --> 00:28:01,380
online and in terms of Linux well it's

462
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:03,450
the same Linux also allows you in

463
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,590
Microsoft to encrypts the virtual

464
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:10,460
machine in the cloud and then

465
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:12,918
the cloud to manage the backup keys that

466
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,110
encryption because encryption is good

467
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,710
and it's excellent for example local

468
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:21,080
level my device is fairly simple to

469
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:24,320
manage because all I'm doing is managing

470
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,720
one device so that is an easy task the

471
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,428
worst that could happen is that it's for

472
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,889
me to suffer outside miss and forget my

473
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:34,700
keys or one day go out partying and

474
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:36,258
forget all of my passwords in fact

475
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,509
there's no button rulers that never

476
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:43,190
change your passwords on Friday because

477
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:46,129
you'll probably forget them by Monday so

478
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:48,499
the administration level well there may

479
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:49,969
be a credentials leak that's possible

480
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:53,409
that someone may forget their

481
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:57,049
credentials it's possible that somebody

482
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:59,869
keep or password may be stolen and used

483
00:28:57,049 --> 00:29:02,149
in another country so it's not entirely

484
00:28:59,869 --> 00:29:04,369
risk-free the platform does offer a

485
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:06,379
series of mechanisms for example in the

486
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:08,029
case of credential leaks it offers

487
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:10,459
double factor authentication or

488
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:12,649
multi-factor authentication and then

489
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,019
it's able to monitor for example who's

490
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:18,549
accessing via different countries you

491
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:21,200
can establish rules and say for example

492
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:23,059
this is just gonna be the Hitler and me

493
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,240
coming out and I can say in this country

494
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:27,980
I don't want anyone to access any of my

495
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,249
information because I've got no users or

496
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,869
no market or anything so these are two

497
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:37,249
things that you can do then in terms of

498
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:42,199
governance does offer you a lot of

499
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:44,269
information people used to call me big

500
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,320
ears when I was small and it is true I

501
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:51,080
had find it difficult to keep the

502
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:52,850
microphone on a governance level as your

503
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,149
platform is able to offer certain

504
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:59,269
mechanisms such as a security center

505
00:29:56,149 --> 00:30:00,979
which I'll describe it later Incident

506
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:02,749
Response Center there's an agreement

507
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,029
between Microsoft in different companies

508
00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:07,820
medically markets different platforms

509
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:10,850
and different services that is whereby a

510
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,350
series of products are offered so that

511
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:16,459
you can have those transparently on the

512
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:17,309
cloud also access to reporting all of

513
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,580
this is set up

514
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:23,340
through best practices and ideas but as

515
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,840
I said it's not a tiny risk free at the

516
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,620
end of the day there are various risks

517
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:32,730
such as knowing who is governing the

518
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:40,949
platform as I said before previously as

519
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:46,499
yours platform didn't offer anyway the

520
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:47,940
news level for controlling that audit

521
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:52,230
said the new platform does allow us to

522
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,330
do this so for example to know when one

523
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,129
user has more privileges than normal or

524
00:30:54,330 --> 00:31:00,470
than you would realize can we switch the

525
00:30:56,129 --> 00:31:00,469
screen please so if we flip over

526
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:12,289
brilliant okay here in the Active

527
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:12,289
Directory

528
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:31,179
for each user you'll have a function

529
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,799
which is called the roll function

530
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:35,809
directory rolling function this

531
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,970
indicates the privileges that that user

532
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:39,710
has with respect to the platform it

533
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,870
indicates what that user will be able to

534
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:51,190
do with the platform then a subscription

535
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:51,189
level we're able to view which users

536
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,030
which is via access control we're able

537
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:05,059
to view which users we have on the

538
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:08,809
platform privileges so you can see that

539
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:14,000
administrators have owner privileges and

540
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:17,178
other users identified there is anyone

541
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,539
here who's administered direct to

542
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:22,070
administrator or Active Directory well

543
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:24,379
there's a big problem in the active

544
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:26,510
director that's namely the groups within

545
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:29,150
the groups the their nested groups

546
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:32,658
embedded groups this happens very often

547
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:35,659
in large companies and when we tried to

548
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:37,789
separate users from certain services we

549
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:39,260
end up adding them to certain groups and

550
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,640
those groups have certain members who

551
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,289
then have further members and further

552
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:47,809
members and before we realize it we

553
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:49,850
descaling and including a group of users

554
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:52,039
that we believe have no privileges we

555
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,570
end up integrating those users in a

556
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,940
group that doesn't have primitive

557
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,889
privileges but that group is a member of

558
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,159
another group with privileges and once

559
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,830
we realize we're including users within

560
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,289
groups of users who are very high level

561
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:10,939
privileges on the platform a sewer is

562
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:13,370
not risk free as I said before and since

563
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:17,720
it allows the inclusion of groups within

564
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:19,879
groups this fault or drawback can also

565
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:30,110
be transferred to the whole virtual

566
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:33,520
world switch back please I'm going to go

567
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,520
as quickly as I possibly can

568
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,060
and the same occurs in the case of patch

569
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,280
management

570
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:49,100
I saw a lazier allows you to configure

571
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:50,720
and visualize all patches which may be

572
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,060
missing in an operating system if it's

573
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,690
independent or whether it's Linux or

574
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:59,210
Windows in the case of SQL we can

575
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:01,880
differentiate whether the database is

576
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,950
encrypted whether the dates are

577
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,870
encrypted the operating system occurs

578
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,030
the same whether it's encrypted on an

579
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:10,370
automated I'll explain everything very

580
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:12,230
quickly as we move forward since I'm not

581
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:15,168
going to show you the demo of the tool

582
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:18,440
I'm going to move on directly on to the

583
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:19,879
network if I'm unable to if I'm able to

584
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,620
configure the platform in accordance

585
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:24,049
with network rules if you've done any

586
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:26,418
firewalling tests it's much of the same

587
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:30,440
thing here you see the rules from the

588
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:32,929
top down as possible fire warning will

589
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,360
have to be audited this virtual device

590
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:38,780
has access to four four eight three and

591
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,120
we'd have to determine why that port is

592
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,620
open and what service is listening in

593
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:48,379
the background but there's a problem

594
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:50,750
here which is reflected in the slide the

595
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:52,668
problems no not so much the platform as

596
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,280
in the case of a Mersenne a sewer a

597
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:58,190
Google or any other platform

598
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,320
the problem is scaling the problem is if

599
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,020
we as auditors or you as auditors and

600
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,360
facts are going to perform an audit of

601
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:08,540
the cloud it doesn't really matter what

602
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,930
the name is the problems the scale and

603
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:14,060
scaling because one thing is auditing in

604
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:17,210
SQL and another thing is auditing in

605
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:26,330
three four or five days 400 virtual

606
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:27,890
machines 400 sql's or 7500 users and for

607
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,480
you to be able to send me a report and

608
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:32,870
to determine that yes there is one

609
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,810
virtual device in Eastern Europe which

610
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:39,680
is missing 40 patches and there's

611
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:43,340
another device in China which has not

612
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,399
been encrypted or there's a SQL that's

613
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,829
lost out there

614
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,529
somewhere that's got some so many ports

615
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:54,720
open and service refusal or denial

616
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:58,589
actions may be executed so the problem

617
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,990
for auditors is scaling there are a

618
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:02,849
series of tools we have a nexus

619
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,799
connector for which you have to pay a

620
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:06,779
little bit more for the license which

621
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:09,480
will provide you with a collector the

622
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:11,369
collector is good it's pretty good in

623
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,460
fact but it's a focused very much on the

624
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:16,890
old platform that hasn't been updated

625
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:19,140
until today this means that it's rather

626
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,900
limited when it comes to trying to

627
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:25,049
obtain information from within the

628
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,000
platform we also have a free tool which

629
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:35,069
is pretty good which is called a site

630
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:36,900
Explorer this tool in PowerShell which

631
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:40,980
exports parts of the as your

632
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:43,260
configuration directly into an to Jason

633
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:45,150
and that Jason can that we imported

634
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:48,000
whatever you want but it will analyze

635
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:53,069
all of the different options that it

636
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,349
identifies in terms of command line

637
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:59,970
tools for the active directory we've got

638
00:36:55,349 --> 00:37:01,950
two types of PowerShell tools which

639
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,500
allow us to interact with the platform

640
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,629
directly for the SEO resource moment

641
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,180
resource manager we've got another set

642
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:12,740
of tools and for the more classic as

643
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:22,879
your development we also have another

644
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:26,700
another set in this slide outlines

645
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:30,450
automation problems this corresponds to

646
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:34,589
all of these steps in an audit in this

647
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:37,558
case in order to us yeah one thing I

648
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:39,328
discovered is that asteroid Explorer or

649
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:41,609
asteroid PowerShell which is an

650
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:44,490
excellent tool for as your audits has

651
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:45,839
only conceived four new azure portals so

652
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,160
if there's any company and they're meant

653
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,230
there are many that have already

654
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,098
deployed and rolled out services on

655
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:52,099
their old platform

656
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:56,099
is going to be blind in other words it's

657
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,380
not going to provide any information

658
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:00,329
with the connector it's a bit the

659
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,489
opposite it was prepared for the older

660
00:38:00,329 --> 00:38:04,950
part but not for the new developments so

661
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:11,180
if you for example have clients you work

662
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:14,729
for a client with services rolled out on

663
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:17,160
both platforms well then we'd have

664
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:19,019
problems auditors and basically what

665
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,118
I've done is developed a tool which I'm

666
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:22,468
going to publish next month I hope and

667
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,619
which you will not be able to see at the

668
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:28,799
moment but this tool allows you to

669
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:31,469
perform an audit or to audit the Azure

670
00:38:28,799 --> 00:38:34,049
platform but can seen for two platforms

671
00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:37,769
the old platforms and the new platforms

672
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:38,999
and allows us to export information in

673
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:43,468
different formats

674
00:38:38,999 --> 00:38:44,640
for example XML JSON text or directly in

675
00:38:43,469 --> 00:38:48,559
office formats

676
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,759
Excel for example all of the information

677
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,890
all of the information on the platform

678
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:56,069
can be provided in those formats the

679
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:57,839
good thing about this tool but the focus

680
00:38:56,069 --> 00:39:01,288
we've given it so that it attracts

681
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:03,180
interest within cloud auditing is that

682
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:05,699
you don't have to install anything you

683
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:08,459
directly download I'm not sure if you do

684
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:10,650
if you've used power exploits or a power

685
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:12,899
chain tool which allows you to perform

686
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:17,449
post exploitation of the platform its

687
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:20,519
conceived much more for those purposes

688
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:23,039
you download PowerShell you import it

689
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,419
into the command line and automatically

690
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:30,180
you have a series of commands that you

691
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:37,199
can use with the platform it's based on

692
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:43,459
a PS directly with the password or with

693
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:45,959
the identifier tenant in the tenant

694
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:48,629
identifier but also subscription

695
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:50,940
identifier well you can do this directly

696
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,680
with those variables and there are many

697
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,410
different options this is one of the

698
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,660
other things that we're trying to

699
00:39:54,410 --> 00:40:01,529
promote very strongly for this we use

700
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:06,810
the adult buy library which is packed

701
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:08,940
directional densification library and

702
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:12,660
the adoptions it's got integration

703
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,520
with.net Python JavaScript nodejs Java

704
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,770
and PowerShell since it's been developed

705
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,540
in PowerShell you can connect directly

706
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,100
to the DLL or this gives you a whole

707
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,190
series of functions which allow you to

708
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:25,430
authenticate on the platform a little

709
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:27,960
bit about the basis basic formats and I

710
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:30,990
just explained a little bit about

711
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,080
activations these are just some of the

712
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:36,060
providers of the tool if you need to

713
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,850
perform auditor's authorization level

714
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:41,520
which type of users are authorized on

715
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:42,990
specific resources in the platform well

716
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,259
there are a series of options within the

717
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:51,270
tool which allow you to do this in a

718
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:53,040
very rapid and simple way this is just

719
00:40:51,270 --> 00:41:03,750
an example of the information that would

720
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:05,100
be returned by the tool console but

721
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,980
there are a series of options that the

722
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:10,110
tool allows you to use to export the

723
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,630
data directly to an excel file to

724
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:14,250
consult the project manager because it's

725
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,510
possible the project manager doesn't

726
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,280
really have to have any of this

727
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,540
technical knowledge and what this person

728
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,740
may need is just the data and the

729
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:24,600
results and that's all okay I advanced

730
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,959
you so this is the complete independence

731
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,339
of tools and the ones from windows so

732
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,570
you can use directly with PowerShell

733
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:37,140
version 3 the results are very

734
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:40,890
interesting at all so these support has

735
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,970
provided two Excel 2010 and 2013 and

736
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:48,240
we're going to see if we can provide

737
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:49,470
support to the latest version as I

738
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,720
mentioned this is something that's going

739
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:54,680
to be published next month if I'm given

740
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:59,339
permission because I'm working together

741
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:01,350
with the Aesir team at Microsoft I asked

742
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:03,930
them questions they already of the tool

743
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:06,270
and they say we'll listen quiet if this

744
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:09,750
part of the plug-in is not working very

745
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:11,119
well it's giving let's say results that

746
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,009
we didn't expect

747
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,680
we're going to send you the new version

748
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:19,869
of the RP and that's basically what I'm

749
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:25,479
working on once overseen for latest data

750
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:25,479
on this tool the changes will be applied

751
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:34,999
and I'll upload it directly to jail hab

752
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:37,450
and to conclude well since there wasn't

753
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:37,450
any sugar

754
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:47,808
could you please switch flip for the

755
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:51,739
browser well just to explain what the

756
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:53,900
tool does for example here it indicates

757
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:55,729
that at this point there are two groups

758
00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:00,469
or one group for something this case in

759
00:42:55,729 --> 00:43:03,999
two users but if you go to the Active

760
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:03,999
Directory groups you'll realize

761
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm not sure if there's marketing part

762
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:24,390
here you consider this one group which

763
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,880
is marketing but it's also belongs to

764
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:30,598
administrators this means that the users

765
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,700
in the marketing group will have global

766
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,369
privileges over the platform which means

767
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:39,470
they can create deletes anything that

768
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:44,369
they want basically via these users here

769
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:52,410
if you go to a skill server the database

770
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:54,779
parts will the database section you can

771
00:43:52,410 --> 00:44:04,680
see that this is just on via clicks just

772
00:43:54,779 --> 00:44:06,059
click away in terms of encryption world

773
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:13,140
you can see that this database is

774
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:17,430
encrypted and I'm not sure what this is

775
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:18,868
this is also encrypted we'd have to

776
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,549
check the database to see if it's

777
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:23,299
encrypted or not these are the checks

778
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:23,299
we'd have to perform

779
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:36,390
here we can see that the audit has been

780
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:39,720
deactivated and threat detection there's

781
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:45,799
a wife above it directly which allows

782
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:48,959
you to detect any malicious SQL sentence

783
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,700
otherwise you may be blind if somebody

784
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,640
tries to attack the database so this is

785
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,649
like a check stage and at the review

786
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:57,450
stage we should try to inform or report

787
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:00,120
that this database doesn't have these

788
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:04,859
checks activated in terms of virtual

789
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:06,930
devices it's a bit the same we'd have to

790
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:13,230
determine whether the virtual devices

791
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:15,660
that I have rolled out I've configured

792
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:17,130
for example for network if there's a

793
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,830
network configuration which is not the

794
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:22,050
desired configuration whether there's

795
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:28,170
any extension that I don't need within

796
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:34,890
the virtual machine if the machines

797
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:36,600
backup is configured and to which in

798
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,339
which country the virtual machine would

799
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,560
be activated as you can see none of

800
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:43,530
these have been activated in backup and

801
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:51,360
on the other side we have something

802
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:53,550
called security center an insecurity

803
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:56,430
center if you following best practices

804
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:59,070
guide for example on the machine side

805
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:03,029
you can see here well the machine is

806
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:06,060
located here it's been monitored the

807
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,320
machines are organized or classified via

808
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:18,380
patches but there are certain

809
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:21,030
vulnerabilities and so for each machine

810
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,560
it would indicate that the security

811
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:28,350
configuration that that machine should

812
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:31,920
have let's see if the page loads is as

813
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:34,259
you would see here on this screen

814
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,940
there are some critical vulnerabilities

815
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,460
of this machine at alert level the

816
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:41,760
machine has a number of configurations

817
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:44,160
that shouldn't be there basically the

818
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,340
problem here is scaling if you've got to

819
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,770
scale Serta 70 machines at once then the

820
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,750
auditor is going to come across problems

821
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:56,460
so using this tool you can directly

822
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:58,290
access all of these checks and

823
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,620
automatically export all of the

824
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:03,900
functions in excel format as if it was a

825
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:07,380
project manager and then we can directly

826
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,440
filter filter according to all of the

827
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:12,960
errors that appeared in the platform and

828
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:18,630
that report can then be sent to the

829
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:20,340
project manager and that's where I would

830
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:27,570
end I'm sorry that I haven't been able

831
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:29,820
to show you the tool and I'll publish

832
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:32,480
this next month so hopefully you'll be

833
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,480
able to see it then

834
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:49,800
and that's all thank you very much thank

835
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:52,640
you

836
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,640

837
