00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,678
um i just want to to mention that um

35
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,799

on cyber security in the united kingdom

55
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,320
and also she has even contributions

56
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,399
to cyber security especially uh

57
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,720
to the war through the cyber security

59
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:49,600
the ois and the idb also launched

60
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,720
um a report a few days ago

61
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,760
and it is also engaged with the world

62
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,679
economic forum

63
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,679
in quantum computing she has been

64
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,440
with the web for several years and she

65
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,880
is also working

66
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,559
on on projects related to iot and mark

he's the head of security at aws

68
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:15,360
with aws as you know it's one of the

top or the top lead companies

70
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,600
uh on cloud um

71
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,240
aws has been also fundamental

72
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,000
for several countries uh and i would say

73
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,440
governments and private sector

74
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,799

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,240
a getting uh up to speed of

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,760
digitalization

78
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,440
over over the past months with that

79

81
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:50,158
the work uh and everything that

82
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:53,200
uh these experts and their institutions

83
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,200
uh are providing a to the strengthening

84
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,240
and fostering or development of cyber

85
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,799
security

86
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,600
uh in respective countries and around

87
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,840

19

96

that you have observed that can have an

97
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,880
impact

98
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,320

you foresee

100
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,678
in the case of victor in in colombia in

101

the

102
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,320
case of jose in the uk and the world

what do you see for the private sector

105
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,480
uh why this energy for cena postponed

106
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,399
any work

107
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,640
are you thinking um i would like also to

108
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,600
to ask victor

about the recent oas and ibb cyber

110
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,879
security

um what is your reflection of this

114
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,320
assessment that the os and the idb

115
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,760
uh to sadie you are working on

116
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,720
iot and quantum computing as i mentioned

117
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,120
before

118
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,159
how do you think this technology could

119
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,840
impact

120
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,159
or is impasse or will impact our lives

121
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,039
what actions do you believe need to be

122
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,960
taken

123
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,080
into consideration for its useful

124
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,039
application

125
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,600
benefit society at large our mark up

126
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,158
besides the the previous question

127
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,039
i will actually also ask you to think

128
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,559
how can the

129
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,960
cloud adoption could help governments

130
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,240
with different cyber security maturity

131
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,440
you know we just

132
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,919
uh relieve the report based on a cmm

133
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,360
um so how this country is probably

134
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,360
they're in an initial

135
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,639
station those are maybe in a more

136
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,760
advanced stage

137
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,960
can uh reach their their goals

138
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,320
um with that uh victor uh i will

however you prepare we have

144
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,119
interpretation of the four languages so

145
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,599

scenarios uh in a post-pandemic world

160
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,960
what actions

161
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,839
uh you think uh like oxford has

162
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,319
taken in this regard besides working on

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,400
uh

164
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,480
and what the world expects a vaccine of

165
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,000
course about than cyber

166
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:17,119
and and also um to work on quantum

167
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,200
computing and iot which i will share the

168
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,280
link to the report in a bit what

169

actually do you believe need to be taken

170
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,560
into consideration for an useful

171
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,480
application to benefit the society at

i i guess i should start with the covet

177
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,720
because i

178
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,839
i feel that victor um covered the issues

179
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:44,799
um very succinctly and very well

180
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,799
and this massive transformation

181
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,920
everybody had to make very quickly

182
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,000
to remote working and

183
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,160
service delivery across the entirety of

184
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,400
societies and of course that's

185
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,920
tested our security architectures and

186
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,040
our ability to

187
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,040
scale up that kind of remote working

188
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,960
very quickly and to worry about the end

189
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,960
points endpoints being people as well as

190
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,720
devices of course

191
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,760
um and in a way the internet's saving

192
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,680
the world and kept

193
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,440
at least some of our economies and our

194
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,200
and our societies

195
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:22,640
moving um and so when we reflect upon

196
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,680
post-covid certainly one thing's for

197
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,720
sure

198
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,799
we need to focus on resilience in the

199
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,160
future because we have seen a massive

200
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,280
growth in threat

201
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,879
in the face of covered not just

202
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,640
exploiting human vulnerability to attack

203
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,400
because so many people are spending so

204
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,319
much more time online

205
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,079
not just in the growth in malware and

206
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,279
fraud

207
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,359
but also in specific targeting of assets

208
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,000
that are growing in value online and if

209
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,598
you're involved in researching vaccines

210
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,440
you won't have failed to notice the

211
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,720
amount of attacks around the world that

212
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,960
are going on against those kind of

213
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,839
institutions

214
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,160
if something like this were to happen

215
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,680
again

216
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,680
or something that were to test the

217
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,520
world's resilience

218
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,720
to a point where we would have to very

219
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,520
quickly move everything online again

220
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,040
we can expect our dependency on the

221
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,800
internet to be

222
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,000
tested and and harmed and so what i

223
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,920
imagine that we'll be doing as a

224
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,640
community is focusing very hard on

225
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,359
understanding systemic cyber risk

226
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,200
aggregation of risk in cyberspace and

227
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:32,240
how we are actually all

228
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,439
interdependent because we if we face

229
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,959
such a challenge again

230
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,720
we will undoubtedly face some more

231
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,319
sophisticated threats so

232
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,319
we see that happening what we've been

233
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,319
doing in oxford of course is

234
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,920
um when we were lucky operationally we

235
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,319
were already built to work a lot

236
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,839
remotely

237
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,359
and of course we have very lively

238
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,078
security teams that are watching the

239
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,319
threats

240
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,240
but in terms of our research in addition

241
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,800
to things like vaccines

242
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,000
in the um in the computer science and

243
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,319
the security capacity

244
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,680
space we've been doing things like we

245
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,200
already have plans

246
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,759
to consider whether you can come up with

247
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,078
a global model of systemic cyber risk

248
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,760
do better in understanding how risk is

249
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,520
aggregating across

250
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,280
societies across supply chains

251
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,280
and we've literally brought forward the

252
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,040
timeline so we have started that

253
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,359
earlier than we were expecting to

254
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,000
because we can see that actually

255
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,960
it's going to be needed this kind of

256
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
capability

257
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,280
to foresee these kinds of things and in

258
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,440
the capacity center we have

259
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,800
stood up stood up a program to actually

260
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,520
study and

261
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,200
listen to people's experiences around

262
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,319
the world and would be hoping

263
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,799
to work with the oas and your community

264
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,160
so that we can aggregate knowledge on

265
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,640
what works really well

266
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,879
in terms of this massive scale up online

267
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,400
what was more challenging

268
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,720
how we can learn lessons across the

269
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,640
globe from each other

270
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,480
and to share that in terms of policy and

271
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,839
advice

272
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,160
when we look to out beyond covert 19

273
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,839
and other kinds of future challenges you

274
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,720
mentioned

275
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,640
quantum computing the internet of things

276
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,279
and certainly where we're taking the

277
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,680
research

278
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,839
now is we are thinking about how these

279
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,399
emerging risks need to be taken account

280
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,319
of when we look at benchmarking national

281
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,240
cybersecurity capacities so what would a

282
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,079
country need to be able to do

283
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,359
in order to properly anticipate how

284
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,359
their

285
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,480
risk environment might be changing to

286
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,160
ensure that they are

287
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,880
have what they need at their fingertips

288
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,879
to deal with that

289
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,040
if i focus first on quantum computing of

290
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,280
course we know that what will happen is

291
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,079
it will absolutely transform the way in

292
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,640
which we do

293
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,800
computation and algorithms and what that

294
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,240
means is you know i'm sure

295
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,240
is that we will literally be able to

296
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,520
solve computing problems we cannot solve

297
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,560
today

298
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,040
massive opportunity in for example drug

299
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,319
discovery and vaccine discovery but also

300
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,720
predictions

301
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,000
of large complex systems such as weather

302
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,799
events

303
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,880
financial market movement it will

304
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,480
undoubtedly revolutionize again

305
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,200
the world of machine learning and that

306
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,800
will make all of those systems much more

307
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,560
predictive and accurate in their

308
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,079
capabilities

309
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,839
any kind of task that involves

310
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,880
simulation and modeling of large

311
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,400
data or data crunching is going to

312
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,839
benefit and of course from a cyber

313
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,240
security perspective that

314
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,799
does deliver some challenges because

315
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,000
certain aspects of what we do right now

316
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,599
we do depend upon the difficulty of the

317
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,119
problem being impractical for an

318
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,359
attacker to solve

319
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,240
like crypto cryptography and that's why

320
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,119
there's been so much

321
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,319
investment in post well quantum

322
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,400
resistant crypto

323
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:45,359
so new algorithms that will stand up to

324
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,240
quantum computers trying to break them

325
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,440
another common um tool that we use

326
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,799
passwords

327
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,560
well it's hard enough for a lot of

328
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,560
people to remember passwords today can

329
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,520
you imagine how complex a password will

330
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,440
have to be

331
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,640
in order to be resistant to a quantum

332
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,880
computer breaking it so there'll

333
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,839
have to be all sorts of new technologies

334
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,040
and

335
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,960
new systems put in place to help us do

336
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,560
the same kinds of cyber security we do

337
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,240
today in the face of quantum worlds

338
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,240
we think it's going to be a reality we

339
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,078
can certainly see the quantum resistant

340
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,000
crypto tools coming to the marketplace

341
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,480
already

342
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,720
so it is something that we will um as a

343
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,079
global community need to keep a watch on

344
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,118
because if you imagine overnight if you

345
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:34,000
are in charge of digital for a country

346
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,640
and somebody phones you up at 5am and

347
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,079
says we've just found out

348
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,078
somebody very bad that would like to

349
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,319
attack our systems has access to this

350
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,480
quantum computing technology every

351
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,000
single piece of data that is encrypted

352
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,880
with an algorithm that is not

353
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,079
quantum resistant is now vulnerable

354
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,400
everything

355
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,920
everything we ever encrypted and if you

356
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,079
imagine about all the stuff we've

357
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,960
encrypted historically that we

358
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,400
literally have stored that will become

359
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,240
vulnerable overnight too

360
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,680
as will all of the passwords if they're

361
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,879
not properly secured

362
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,160
and of of appropriate complexity and

363
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,480
protected by the quick

364
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,560
the new quantum resistive cryptos so we

365
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,640
have operational challenges

366
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,400
we've been studying most recently the

367
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,359
industrial internet of things because we

368
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,119
can see that this is going to

369
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,040
revolutionize

370
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,960
all process control environments

371
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,240
transport

372
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,200
modern cities carbon reduction energy

373
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,279
efficiencies all

374
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,040
of that kind of thing and we have been

375
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,440
considering how the dynamics are going

376
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,960
to change in cyberspace

377
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:40,079
new big data faster quicker processing

378
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,839
lots of interactions between devices and

379
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,839
what that might mean for operational

380
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:46,240
cyber security and

381
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,160
we have identified a number of issues

382
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,160
they actually relate quite closely to

383
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,759
what i was just saying around covert 19

384
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,000
and some of the most significant ones

385
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,880
being

386
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,480
in that area of interdependency and and

387
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,760
actually how these things connect down

388
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,680
through supply chains and um

389
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,440
we have produced a foresight report

390
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,118
making some recommendations as to what

391
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,559
we should all be doing together in order

392
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,720
to start preparing

393
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,960
for that future so we can take advantage

394
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,279
of those technologies

395
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,079
which are underpinned by the move to 5g

396
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,680
and the like

397
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,960
as well as cloud and hopefully at the

398
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,000
end of this session you'll be able to

399
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,800
share the url because

400
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,440
we've had that report translated into

401
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,040
spanish

402
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,880
and we're happy to launch that today and

403
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,720
we really hope that um

404
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,200
people participating in the boot camp

405
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,200
will take the opportunity to

406
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,720
read that and and if anyone was

407
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,640
interested in working with us moving

408
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,118
forward we would like to hear from you

409
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,040
and i guess my final word is this that

410
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,559
when we have been working as a community

411
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,558
on the

412
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,680
on the benchmarking of nations national

413
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:49,200
capacity and

414
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:52,078
and oas have been a lead player

415
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,160
in and making sure that we gain real

416
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,040
value from the insight of benchmarking

417
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,720
nations

418
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,480
oh thank you for sharing that um

419
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,160
where we're moving now is we're thinking

420
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,760
about okay

421
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,598
when nations have priorities and

422
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,119
sometimes those nations priorities are

423
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,720
around threat

424
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,640
and sometimes those priorities are going

425
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,160
to be around economic opportunity as we

426
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,040
heard from the secretary of state for

427
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,960
spain

428
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,960
and their new digital spain vision 2025

429
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,720
cyber security will be a pillar in there

430
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,160
but they're not doing cyber security for

431
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,919
its own sake they're doing cyber

432
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,598
security because they see the future of

433
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,880
the spanish economy and the wealth of

434
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,160
the society

435
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:34,000
and prosperity as being contingent upon

436
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:37,359
success in data and cyberspace

437
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,680
and so we can see that we need to move

438
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,680
beyond just a benchmark of national

439
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,480
capacity and towards some

440
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,680
tangible advice for how you prioritize

441
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,440
investments

442
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,520
towards whatever that opportunity might

443
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,400
be so you might be a country that sees

444
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,240
itself

445
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,119
having the smart cities of the future

446
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,799
being a world leader in smart cities in

447
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,319
carbon footprint reduction or you might

448
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,200
be a country that sees itself

449
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:03,200
attracting the best most interesting

450
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,558
manufacturing of the future because you

451
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,759
can support

452
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:10,400
the most intelligent data rich factory

453
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,440
environments or whatever that economic

454
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,280
opportunity may be

455
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,559
and and we think that there's some work

456
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,839
that could be done

457
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,480
on helping to prioritize cyber security

458
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,279
investment

459
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,800
towards those opportunities as well as

460
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,520
for example if you feel your whole

461
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,520
economy is

462
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,559
contingent upon advanced machine

463
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,240
learning

464
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,319
having a think about how you prepare for

465
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,040
those kinds of threats too

466
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,040
thanks belly

467
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,280
great no thank you thank you sadie for

468
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,000
this great intervention

469
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,760
uh mark um would you mind sharing your

470
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,280
thoughts

471
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,760
i'd be happy to again thanks for

472
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,400
including me and amazon web services and

473
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,040
your

474
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,520
very interesting panel today so let's

475
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,160
talk

476
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,400
initially about the covet 19 some of the

477
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,799
impact i'll start with the amazon

478
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,200
experience like many companies and many

479
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,200
organizations and agencies globally

480
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,640
we had to make a big shift to work from

481
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,799
home of course um

482
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,879
you know most of our uh employees who

483
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,760
build and operate our cloud platform

484
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,240
can operate virtually um you know we're

485
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,240
have

486
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,598
large software organizations software

487
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,439
engineering teams and

488
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,040
operations teams that can can work that

489
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,640
we do work

490
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,400
logically all the time because they're

491
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,720
operating a massive global

492
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
infrastructure and and doing that

493
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,319
of course through through networks and

494
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,640
through secure connections

495
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,880
um in the end though even cloud still

496
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,319
has physical reality to it and so

497
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,480
there were some changes that were

498
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,800
required to operate our data centers now

499
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,319
our data centers do not require

500
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,800
huge numbers of employees they're

501
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:43,359
operated in a very very lean and mean

502
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,880
fashion if you will but we did make some

503
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,920
adjustments in terms of physical

504
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,520
presence

505
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,280
breaking things down into cells and

506
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,359
teams so that

507
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,960
there was less chance of uh of

508
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,119
transmission of disease in the case

509
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,400
someone got sick we could isolate just a

510
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,880
smaller group

511
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,720
um there was you know d we stopped a lot

512
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,160
of the physical presence that was

513
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,839
typically there but not absolutely

514
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,078
necessary

515
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:07,119
and of course supply chain was a

516
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,119
challenge but we

517
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:10,559
survived that well we were able to

518
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,200
maintain a good

519
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,960
flow of equipment and capability we're

520
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,960
constantly growing so we're constantly

521
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,880
delivering servers and networking gear

522
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,599
and so forth to our data centers

523
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,240
and we need to uh to do that to meet the

524
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:24,720
demand

525
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,279
um so so that's kind of the a little bit

526
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,078
about the amazon experience but that

527
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,839
also blurs into the ability that we have

528
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,400
with the cloud technology to serve the

529
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,558
larger

530
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,839
community in the world and that's been a

531
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,880
real success story

532
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,759
um lots of customers going into more

533
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,880
virtual

534
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,680
work uh ramping up their online presence

535
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,559
with more

536
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,078
for example vpn technology lots more

537
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,040
video conferencing

538
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,720
we saw a very large increase in global

539
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,319
internet traffic

540
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,799
it's funny there's a pattern in internet

541
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,520
traffic typically in which the peak

542
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,880
usage is actually in the evening for

543
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,359
video streaming and

544
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,240
uh kind of personal pursuits but what

545
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,319
happened

546
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,520
during the pandemic is that the

547
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,839
networking usage

548
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,520
began to spike in the morning and

549
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,040
sustained throughout the the working day

550
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,920
and then into the evening so the

551
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,880
the the maximum usage didn't increase uh

552
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,119
a lot

553
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,960
but the um you know the the belt the

554
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,720
curve sort of flattened so instead of

555
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,240
you know being lower in the business day

556
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,200
and then peaking in the evening

557
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,399
we saw a early peak around the globe

558
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,520
during the work day

559
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,280
going into the evening as well um so our

560
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,800
in general the network held up pretty

561
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,800
well the internet did pretty well there

562
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,119
were some last mile congestion problems

563
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,240
with local isps and delivery

564
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,319
uh the backbone however did did well

565
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,959
but we did have to increase capacity

566
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:49,200
very rapidly we saw in general about

567
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,640
almost a 40 percent increase in outbound

568
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,598
traffic from our cloud

569
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:55,359
platform over a two-month period as mo

570
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,440
probably primarily it's mostly going to

571
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,680
be the video streaming use cases that

572
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,119
really spiked during that time

573
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,720
we were able to meet that capacity

574
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:05,839
demand and customers had a great

575
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,839
experience so it's a good example of how

576
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,440
the general move across the industry

577
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,000
towards cloud computing

578
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,119
and the agility the elasticity of these

579
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,839
platforms

580
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,119
can be really really beneficial so kind

581
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,279
of moving into your second

582
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,720
question and thinking about how

583
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,240
governments and enterprises use cloud

584
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,078
again it's it's a global trend it's

585
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,399
happening rapidly i think this

586
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,359
uh experience of kobit 19 will

587
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,440
accelerate that

588
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:33,598
transition um cloud is very much a

589
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,680
democratizing

590
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,880
technology it's a technology which

591
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,759
allows

592
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,280
smaller um less sophisticated

593
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,599
organizations to get

594
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,960
access to some of the best technology

595
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,200
more easily

596
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:49,119
uh then traditionally only the most

597
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,680
sophisticated organizations would be

598
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,720
able to

599
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,960
to access and so we really

600
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,558
um you know we enjoy participating in

601
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,400
that process of

602
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,000
greater access to sophisticated

603
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,559
technology with

604
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
with medium and small businesses with uh

605
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,480
you know smaller governments

606
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,079
government agencies um of course there's

607
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:11,200
still work to be done there's still

608
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,720
uh training and and uh you know skills

609
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,439
that have to be developed

610
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,879
um but the uh the use of these sort of

611
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,079
soft what we call software-defined

612
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,839
infrastructure

613
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:22,160
uh where instead of people building out

614
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:24,319
equipment and buying all this gear

615
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,799
you're learning to use to use software

616
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:29,440
to use apis to use user interfaces to

617
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,880
provision deploy operate your it

618
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,040
infrastructure

619
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,880
this has been a real benefit to to

620
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,000
organizations to governments around the

621
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,839
globe as they

622
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,440
as they modernize their their their

623
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:42,000
systems and also

624
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,359
build the capacity to uh interact with

625
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,640
their citizens one of the really

626
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:48,078
interesting trends

627
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:51,040
that we saw in the last few months is

628
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,160
we have a number of customers globally

629
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,599
in in governments

630
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,040
who have built their own version of

631
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,520
something like zoom

632
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,880
we have we have the a building block

633
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,759
service

634
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,640
which we call the chime sdk where a

635
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,000
company with

636
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,520
pretty small amount of code can

637
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,079
essentially build their own private

638
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,040
version

639
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,440
of of this kind of zoom experience so we

640
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,880
have

641
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,240
government agencies around the globe

642
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,599
that are you know considering this kind

643
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,000
of the new normal we're going to have to

644
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,160
interact

645
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,119
with our citizens whether it's a pension

646
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,160
organization

647
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,440
a licensing bureau

648
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,440
we're going to need to interact with

649
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,200
them over the network in a way that we

650
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,960
never had to before

651
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,240
but there may not be comfortable using

652
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,079
commercial off-the-shelf

653
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,680
products for that because we've seen

654
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,000
some experience of

655
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,919
cyber issues with some of the the

656
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,839
commercial products so

657
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,000
the interesting trend is is the fact

658
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,200
that now with a relatively small amount

659
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,720
of custom code

660
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,799
governments can essentially deploy a

661
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,839
private um sort of teleconferencing

662
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:49,920
capability

663
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,680
and use that for citizen interaction so

664
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,720
that's been an interesting and

665
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,240
uh an exciting development to see

666
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,319
a couple of words on on quantum

667
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,479
computing that's it's a great topic

668
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:02,880
i think the good news is the industry is

669
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,000
acting uh very responsibly trying to get

670
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,440
ahead of

671
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,640
of the problem before it becomes a

672
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:11,119
problem um our company and many others

673
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,799
and many research institutions have been

674
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:16,079
participating in a

675
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:19,440
what's called uh post-quantum crypto pqc

676
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,839
um sort of uh contest uh a very serious

677
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,799
one

678
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:23,200
uh experts evaluating other experts um

679
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,280
there's

680
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,040
it's been it's a very global effort it's

681
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,119
kind of being right now supervised under

682
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,279
the auspices of the national institutes

683
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:33,920
for standards and technology in the us

684
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,200
nist um there's just been another down

685
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,880
selection of uh

686
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,240
of rounds they started off with about 80

687
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,040
submissions oh

688
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,799
sorry about that a classic background

689
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,240
noise from working at home

690
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:48,079
um uh about 80 submissions we're then

691
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,439
narrowed down to about 26 and then just

692
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,799
in the last few weeks we've seen that

693
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,040
narrowed down to about 15

694
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,079
finalists um and so the industry is

695
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,440
really

696
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:59,440
homing in on encryption

697
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,480
algorithms that are very quantum

698
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,079
resistant

699
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,799
um and we've actually deployed in

700
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:07,280
production a early version of that

701
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,480
protecting our key management system so

702
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,680
i think we're in a pretty good shape i

703
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,720
think over the next few years you'll

704
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,200
begin to see

705
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:14,240
commercial solutions that anticipate the

706
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,078
the challenges

707
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,839
um that are expected to come from the

708
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,960
general purpose quantum computer when it

709
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,319
comes to

710
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,079
uh information security but it's

711
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,960
certainly an important topic and one to

712
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,280
keep an eye on

713
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,520
one one good thing that um i'll mention

714
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:30,079
it's kind of a bit of a detail but

715
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,000
the most vulnerable algorithms are what

716
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,599
are called public key or asymmetric

717
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,200
encryption algorithms and these are used

718
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:36,480
typically for network traffic and

719
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,000
network interaction

720
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,720
so we really got to get ahead on that

721
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,960
one somewhat better news is the

722
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,200
the symmetric encryption algorithms ones

723
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,079
used for just storing data on a

724
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,960
storage device for example are not as

725
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,960
vulnerable

726
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,720
it appears according to current research

727
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,160
um to to quantum

728
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,240
uh to quantum sort of um challenges

729
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,640
so we have a bit more runway there i

730
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,078
think and we'll i think we'll be able to

731
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,078
to accomplish that but it's certainly

732
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,400
something that we have to be active and

733
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,200
vigilant because we don't want to uh

734
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,839
um as uh as dr crease was saying wake up

735
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,919
one day and

736
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,359
realize that you know an attacker has

737
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,160
access to things that we thought were

738
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,119
safe

739
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,000
so there's a bit of an overview covering

740
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,960
both the amazon

741
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,839
experience use of cloud and the way that

742
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,440
cloud has

743
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,920
been very helpful i think in this time

744
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,839
of crisis and it really accelerated an

745
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,559
existing trend towards

746
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:32,078
using pay-as-you-go elastic

747
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,720
software-defined infrastructure rather

748
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,280
than buying

749
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,200
and deploying physical equipment and

750
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:40,799
then a bit on quantum as well

751
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,799
so thank thanks for your questions

752
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,200
thanks to you margan if you hear a fire

753
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:47,119
truck

754
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,118
that's my daughter as well so actually

755
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,040
that's i believe that's one of the good

756
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,599
things about being

757
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,240
working from home so i'm sure everyone

758
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,240
is

759
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,240
enjoying a little bit of time with their

760
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,040
beloved ones with their family at least

761
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,359
i am

762
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,200
uh i'm sure you you love to be with your

763
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,480
dog right

764
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,399
yeah it's interesting it's it's a

765
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,160
humanizing experience we used to feel

766
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,480
embarrassed when we were working at home

767
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,078
and

768
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,000
we'd hear a child's laughter in the

769
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,599
background and now it's become

770
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,280
the new normal and i think it's an

771
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,000
improvement personally i i think it's

772
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,559
great

773
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,599
yeah not in the doorbell when you have

774
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,599
more deliveries right

775
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:24,319
amazon

776
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,040
and i'm sorry i don't want to to uh this

777
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,200
is

778
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,640
uh not official views of the oas nor

779
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,480
it's member states nor

780
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,000
in syria but i need to say that thank

781
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,359
you amazon because

782
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,400
i would say my life lately with too many

783
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:43,839
deliveries

784
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:45,520
um victor um are you still there uh we

785
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:48,880
want to

786
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:53,119
we want to go um

787
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:55,839
final question so i would like to

788
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,880
go through this final round uh but i

789
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,880
want to you know

790
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,559
it's an unique opportunity to to have

791
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,440
you here with over 500 people from the

792
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,079
region

793
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,119
and many of these countries uh have

794
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,920
developed

795
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:11,040
or let me change the spanish sorry mucho

796
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,040
de esto spaces

797
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:20,558
many of these countries have developed

798
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:24,078
or are developing or are thinking

799
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:25,280
on developing a app like uh similar to

800
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,119
corona

801
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,599
um i and i was in a in a panel the other

802
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,799
day

803
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:36,839
so please if you can share with us

804
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:39,920
uh how does the government guarantee

805
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:42,160
um human right like privacy

806
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,960
uh and all the information that it's

807
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,240
hungry

808
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,359
that's a question number one about the

809
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,399
app

810
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:53,440
the second one you mention

811
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:56,720
the importance of

812
01:01:53,440 --> 01:02:00,559
collaboration of engaging the

813
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:03,839
stakeholders um how do you see

814
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:06,000
uh the the work the government

815
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:07,359
working with the private sector the

816
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,039
civil society

817
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:12,558
and and academia in the implementation

818
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,760
of a recent

819
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,039
cyber security policy that a actually

820
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,400
gillette

821
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:23,920
uh how do you see that and

822
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:27,280
and the third question it's a awareness

823
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:30,720
and education have been identified as a

824
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,480
key element in order to equip any users

825
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,959
in a secure technology

826
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,960
colombia is advancing tremendously on

827
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,520
digitalization and internet access you

828
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,559
just

829
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:43,440
had the 5g allocation

830
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,480
this is your third cyber security policy

831
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,359
would you mind

832
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,079
sharing what are the some of the plans

833
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:51,520
to increase

834
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,160
awareness and education at all levels of

835
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,599
the

836
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:59,759
society i mean every single colombia

837
01:02:55,599 --> 01:03:02,799
like uh your aunt your daughter

838
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:17,839
whoever so sorry to assume this but it's

839
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:17,839
a unique opportunity to have you here

840
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:56,280
[Music]

841
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,839
is

842
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,839
corresponding

843
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:37,839
is

844
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:04,079
[Applause]

845
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,839
is

846
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:47,839
um

847
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,930
[Music]

848
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:35,839
is

849
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:53,210
[Music]

850
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,280
and maybe we can close and interact with

851
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,520
the public a little bit

852
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,280
you know this there is an environment of

853
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,520
increasing digitalization

854
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,800
but the about the public and the private

855
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,840
sector including

856
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,640
smes which for us it's a really really

857
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,440
important

858
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,000
because they are one of the main cores

859
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,559
of the

860
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,440
economy they they represent a lot of for

861
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,120
the

862
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:40,080
gdp and you know there are also a lot of

863
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:44,400
viewmen

864
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:47,679
that rely on on smes uh so

865
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,960
it's a whole engine for for the world

866
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,960
and from the society

867
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,080
what are your thoughts about the

868
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,080
importance

869
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:59,840
of education especially for the future

870
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:03,600
generation of professionals um

871
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:07,040
you know uh i would like to to ask you

872
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,040
um also a little bit about ai we already

873
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,600
talked a little bit about quantum

874
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,239
about iot but i would like to to assume

875
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,960
about

876
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,599
artificial intelligence and all this

877
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,120
emerging

878
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:21,679
technology that amazon um

879
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,040
you know is investing and you know i'm

880
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,920
sure we'll continue to invest

881
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,960
a lot of resources i know i always talk

882
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,520
to

883
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,239
to my colleagues at aws and the first

884
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,640
thing about

885
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:34,159
ai is alexa but we understand that it's

886
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,840
more than alexa

887
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:42,639
um how this

888
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:45,600
technology and how your company

889
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,320
will be taking into account these these

890
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,520
issues

891
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,519
so the furniture thank you

892
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:59,840
so that's those are great questions um

893
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,120
and i think the the question about the

894
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,880
subject matter expert

895
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,400
and the need for education is really

896
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,960
really key um

897
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:08,320
we have been working hard for the last

898
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:11,600
few years to

899
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:13,440
develop mechanisms for increasing that

900
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,920
outreach and that ability to educate

901
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:19,678
experts we have a whole program

902
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:22,760
we call aws educate i encourage your

903
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,400
the viewers to check look look into that

904
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,880
awseducate.com

905
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,320
so it's basically a combination of a

906
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,920
learning platform

907
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:34,400
a a networking tool to enable experts to

908
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,000
meet other experts it's a way of sharing

909
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:38,719
curricula so computer science

910
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,239
professors you join this community and

911
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:41,679
they share some of their

912
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,280
their courses and their and their

913
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,280
learning materials

914
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,719
um and there's whole learning tracks and

915
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,480
paths through the educate

916
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,480
platform so that in the end the student

917
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:52,559
will come out with a certificate

918
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,080
and various kinds of specializations so

919
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,239
for example the cyber security

920
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,559
specialization has been a real

921
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:59,678
important one and received a lot of

922
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,199
interest in usage

923
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:05,679
lately and that's been exciting to see

924
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:06,559
us being able to reach a new generation

925
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,760
of

926
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:11,040
experts so we can build for serving the

927
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,159
cyber security needs

928
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:15,440
of of of the world as we go forward and

929
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,799
speaking of machine learning machine

930
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,120
learning is probably the

931
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:20,960
the second most popular learning track

932
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:23,760
in our educate platform

933
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,480
that's really uh valuable new set of

934
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,000
skills

935
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:29,599
around data science machine learning

936
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,280
as you know machine learning is is

937
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,760
really seen a new renaissance in the

938
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:34,239
last

939
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,120
few years it's interesting because if

940
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,879
you look at the

941
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,640
computer science behind machine learning

942
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,719
it's been around for a while there's

943
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,640
some of the core algorithms invented 10

944
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:44,560
or 20 years ago or more

945
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,320
but what was really lacking were two

946
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,640
things first of all

947
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,440
data trumps algorithms the more data you

948
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,640
have

949
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:54,719
the better the algorithms will operate

950
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,560
even where two algorithms might

951
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:58,960
otherwise one might be superior but if

952
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,400
you feed the less superior algorithm

953
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,800
a lot more data it will actually

954
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,159
outperform so so aggregation of very

955
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,159
large data sets

956
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,599
which is characteristic of the cloud era

957
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,759
is really um

958
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,960
creating this this explosive growth in

959
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,400
that field and

960
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,400
similarly you need a lot of

961
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,000
computational power and that's another

962
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,120
thing that's really exploded

963
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,640
in the last few years the the use of

964
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:23,519
of gpus graphical programming units

965
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,400
ironically

966
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,960
a lot of this high-end gpu technology

967
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,040
was

968
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,159
really inventive and enhanced for for

969
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,400
the purpose of

970
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:34,400
3d graphics and for gaming so you you

971
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,599
can thank the gamers of the world for

972
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,599
um powering the economic engine that

973
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,120
invented some of the most powerful and

974
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,840
high performance

975
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,360
gpus which are now used for uh use cases

976
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,640
that have nothing to do with gaming or

977
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,719
graphics

978
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,760
but they do have this the ability to

979
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,400
process

980
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:54,080
um data in in par you know extremely

981
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,440
parallel fashion and so that's

982
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:59,440
resulted in a really important new

983
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,879
era if you will for for machine learning

984
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,719
the combination of the

985
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,640
computational power that people need

986
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:06,560
access to that power through

987
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,760
cloud platforms and then massive data

988
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:09,440
sets um

989
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,600
now you're really beginning to see that

990
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,519
that you know expand across every every

991
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,480
possible field all the way from yes as

992
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,960
you mentioned

993
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,519
um everyday use cases like alexa or

994
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,400
other

995
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,800
voice recognition voice response systems

996
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:24,159
um

997
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:27,440
to you know date recommendation systems

998
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:28,960
amazon.com for example is done a huge

999
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,759
amount of work in the machine learning

1000
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,159
era

1001
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,760
to enable people to shop for clothing

1002
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:35,920
online think about that it's it's a

1003
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,320
difficult problem you know you have

1004
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,199
to represent a three-dimensional object

1005
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,400
a person

1006
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:44,159
uh in a way that you can be some

1007
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,679
somewhat certain that what you send them

1008
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,519
is going to be to fit them well

1009
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:49,360
and look good on them and so it turns

1010
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,520
out that you can apply

1011
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,799
machine learning technology to help

1012
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,159
really improve those

1013
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:58,080
those scenarios but again being in a

1014
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:00,159
security role myself you know that

1015
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,679
what's near and dear to my heart is

1016
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:03,440
the use of machine learning in the

1017
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:06,480
security realm so that's been

1018
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:07,759
a big boon for security professionals to

1019
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:10,559
begin to

1020
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:11,760
use those tools to look for patterns uh

1021
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,320
to look for

1022
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,560
anomalies to recognize things that were

1023
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,120
really hard to detect before to see the

1024
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,080
signal

1025
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,040
uh in a large amount of noise and

1026
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,280
machine learning is

1027
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,679
now a critical part of many of the tools

1028
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:28,400
that we operate and the tools that we

1029
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:30,640
provide to customers with some of our

1030
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:34,799
cyber security services

1031
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:36,880
and that enables a much more accurate

1032
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,400
calling out of the of the key indicators

1033
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,560
that a human must

1034
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,920
look at and investigate we can automate

1035
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,120
a lot of that as well

1036
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,920
but in the end one of the big problems

1037
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:48,480
for the cyber security professional it's

1038
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:50,800
called

1039
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:52,639
alert fatigue or alarm fatigue you get

1040
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,000
so many indicators there's something

1041
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,320
wrong

1042
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,760
most of which are not correct and after

1043
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,120
a while you just start saying okay

1044
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,199
whatever whatever you don't

1045
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:02,719
pay attention and then that one critical

1046
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,040
indicator that really indicates

1047
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,719
something serious has happening

1048
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:09,760
will get lost in the noise and that's

1049
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:13,120
where the computers can really help us

1050
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,400
filter out the noise and and recognize

1051
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:16,640
the key

1052
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,639
combinations of factors which lead to a

1053
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,640
real security incident

1054
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,320
um where we can either automate the

1055
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,400
response in many cases

1056
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,519
or we can get the human actors with

1057
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,000
their high judgment

1058
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,719
involved very early and quickly in order

1059
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,080
to deal with

1060
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,080
with the issues as they arise

1061
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:37,120
i thank you mark monica croquet

1062
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:45,840
finale pregunta

1063
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:16,320
you know like oxford has a partner or

1064
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:19,280
supporter the implementation of the cmn

1065
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,960
uh i think it's over 60 countries now

1066
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:24,080
you might have the the right number

1067
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:27,760
on top so what do you

1068
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:31,199
see like uh citizens could get into

1069
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:34,239
the governments and the companies to

1070
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:37,678
you know to address these cyber security

1071
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:39,440
uh issues uh and a mark from your

1072
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,040
perspective from the private sector you

1073
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,599
know it would be good to

1074
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:45,519
to actually get your your point of view

1075
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,640
what would you expect

1076
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:49,120
from from citizens uh and how do you

1077
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,920
think

1078
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:53,440
that transformation could be uh could

1079
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,320
happen so sadie why don't we start with

1080
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,799
you

1081
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,159
yeah thank you um yes it's a really

1082
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,560
brilliant question i think we're getting

1083
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:01,199
close

1084
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,560
to 80 countries now um between us around

1085
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:05,678
the world

1086
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:07,679
quite something um the

1087
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:09,600
importance i guess in a way we're

1088
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,040
talking about getting cyber security

1089
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,400
mindset

1090
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:15,840
in um to the population at large

1091
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,440
and so we're not talking about cyber

1092
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,040
security professionals we're talking

1093
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,839
about the people

1094
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:23,920
who are running our cafes building the

1095
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,880
smes that you were talking about before

1096
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:28,080
that are going to be clients of mark's

1097
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,560
company

1098
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,760
and to a certain extent we want them to

1099
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,880
be

1100
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:37,360
mindful careful resistant

1101
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,560
to social engineering manipulative

1102
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,719
attacks

1103
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,560
um emails that will encourage them to

1104
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:45,520
give away credentials

1105
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,239
and to be able to purchase goods good

1106
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,159
services

1107
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:51,440
from data companies that will have cyber

1108
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:53,360
security packaged in and automated

1109
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,960
what we find is as we look around the

1110
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,320
world that there's many different kinds

1111
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,719
of culture but

1112
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,239
indeed good indicators that the mindsets

1113
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,080
being achieved will be

1114
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:04,320
you will see a debate in the national

1115
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,120
press you will see people discussing

1116
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,400
this

1117
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:10,559
evidence of um cyber security being

1118
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,679
present in people's minds

1119
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,920
and when we see countries that have

1120
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:17,040
um are quite advanced in that then we

1121
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,600
will see

1122
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:23,040
business leaders as well as educators

1123
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:25,760
pillars of civil society

1124
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,719
including these kinds of activities

1125
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,800
helping people

1126
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:30,320
offering services free educational

1127
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,239
packages

1128
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,759
helping their employees protect

1129
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:35,280
themselves at work

1130
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,360
and explaining how they can go and

1131
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,360
protect their families

1132
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:41,839
and their local communities and as soon

1133
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,920
as you see that kind of

1134
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,120
pushing it into the dna of the cultural

1135
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:49,280
action

1136
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,280
then we see a rising in capacity

1137
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,560
mark any thoughts

1138
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,600
those are great great comments i agree

1139
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,760
with all those perspectives

1140
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,639
it's interesting it's always the case

1141
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,960
that no matter how

1142
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:05,040
fancy the technology gets we still need

1143
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,120
humans to exercise good judgment

1144
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,239
and we for example don't expect people

1145
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:11,440
to be able to drive

1146
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:13,919
safely without training um but we have

1147
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:16,000
historically been a little naive about

1148
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,280
using computer systems and just assume

1149
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,080
that there was no

1150
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:22,080
training or you know building up of

1151
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,679
skills or judgment required and i think

1152
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,519
it's very clear now that that's got to

1153
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:28,560
be a critical part of

1154
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,280
our educational systems our government

1155
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,760
agency

1156
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,880
employment scenarios you know private

1157
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,280
enterprise

1158
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,239
i think it's becoming much more typical

1159
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:38,559
now that

1160
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:40,480
in order to be a responsible member of

1161
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:43,120
the cyber community that we

1162
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,199
as an organization and all other

1163
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:47,440
organizations are building that type of

1164
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:48,320
security training and awareness into our

1165
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,480
kind of daily

1166
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,920
daily routines but it will take some

1167
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,919
time we still see you know

1168
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,440
the that's a little bit daunting the

1169
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:57,840
number of people that will still click

1170
01:21:55,440 --> 01:22:00,159
on a pretty obvious phishing link

1171
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,080
uh that you know has a lot of you know

1172
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:03,440
warning signs around it so to speak if

1173
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,159
you have a little bit of uh

1174
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,559
training or paying close attention um

1175
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:08,320
but

1176
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,040
i think we're getting better we continue

1177
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:13,040
to to see you know some gradual declines

1178
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:15,840
in people making kind of the the most

1179
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,480
obvious mistakes and and the the the

1180
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,480
vendor

1181
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,519
the technology community i think is

1182
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,718
continually making

1183
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,360
improvements small improvements

1184
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,679
incremental improvements um in filtering

1185
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,080
out

1186
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:27,520
for example major emails you know

1187
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:29,360
systems which will

1188
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,280
essentially flag or warn much more

1189
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,719
clearly or just simply not allow you to

1190
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,800
click on links with them when they know

1191
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,440
that they lead to a site that's been

1192
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:38,239
flagged as

1193
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,599
a as a malware site or some kind of a

1194
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:42,480
attacker site

1195
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,600
um so you know the i'd say the tide is

1196
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,559
gradually rising

1197
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,120
uh to improve um the overall cyber

1198
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:49,120
health of

1199
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:51,120
of our communities but of course um

1200
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,800
there's a lot of bad actors who are also

1201
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:54,159
getting more sophisticated so it's a

1202
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,400
kind of a

1203
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:58,719
it's a battle and it's it's a race but i

1204
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:00,239
think i think that overall i i'm

1205
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,880
optimistic about the future i think

1206
01:23:00,239 --> 01:23:04,959
we're going to cut down a lot more on

1207
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,320
some of the spam and fishing problems

1208
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,440
which you know really plague our end

1209
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,239
user community

1210
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,719
i think the whole another very very prob

1211
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:13,839
you know

1212
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,719
typical problem of uh historically has

1213
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,960
been

1214
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:18,880
failure to patch systems people

1215
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,400
literally never patched their old

1216
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:22,639
servers their old

1217
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,480
desktops and so forth and and that is

1218
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:26,320
again gradually changing i think the

1219
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:29,440
advent of the mobile phone

1220
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,080
um ecosystem where the the the phone

1221
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,638
vendors

1222
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:35,120
have become very aggressive about sort

1223
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:36,400
of forcing upgrades and forcing patches

1224
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,960
and making it so your

1225
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:40,719
your device just doesn't work correctly

1226
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,040
or won't install the latest apps unless

1227
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,920
you

1228
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,639
keep up with uh security patches that

1229
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,199
set a good

1230
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:49,040
i think a good leading indicator and the

1231
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:51,519
latest versions of

1232
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,639
of the windows and and mac operating

1233
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,800
systems i think are

1234
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,840
are much more secure than the older ones

1235
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,159
were so

1236
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,080
lots of good things happening um to make

1237
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:02,879
the kind of end user scenarios

1238
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,440
uh more secure and on the back end um

1239
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:06,320
using

1240
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,519
um again modern technologies more

1241
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,599
automation

1242
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,639
uh using things like cloud technology to

1243
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:12,560
to automate

1244
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:14,239
processes that used to be very manual

1245
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,239
and require a lot of labor and labor

1246
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:18,159
intensive but not require any real

1247
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:18,480
judgment just having to type commands

1248
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,080
and

1249
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,599
you know hit enter a bunch of times on a

1250
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,600
bunch of systems that

1251
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,960
is that's not what we want our security

1252
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,480
professionals to be doing we want them

1253
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,679
to be

1254
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:30,000
automating their tools using automated

1255
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,480
tools

1256
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,600
as much as possible to do those things

1257
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,199
and then applying

1258
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,639
their skills where high judgment is

1259
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:38,879
required so

1260
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,320
um i think again making progress a lot

1261
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,159
lots to be done

1262
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,440
and we're excited to be working with

1263
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:46,159
lots of great customers

1264
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,360
across government across the private

1265
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:49,599
enterprise

1266
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:50,799
to make it easier and safer for people

1267
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:53,120
to participate in this

1268
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:59,840
in this global ecosystem great thank you

1269
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:59,840
monica um

1270
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,239
okay so

1271
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,320
yeah and also before going to to that

1272
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:53,679
question monica because i saw that one

1273
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,759
of the questions

1274
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,239
a couple of participants were asking

1275
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,080
about the ethics and what we think which

1276
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:02,000
we believe it's essential and very

1277
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:04,239
important and they were asking about how

1278
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,080
the oys engaged on ethical

1279
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:10,559
things from our side of course uh we are

1280
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,440
a organization that works based on

1281
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,000
mandate

1282
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,960
never that nevertheless uh our

1283
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,040
engagement

1284
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,239
with the academia with the civil society

1285
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:21,519
with the private sector

1286
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:23,280
is essential to warranty and that that

1287
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:25,840
ethic that's why today

1288
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,360
we were they we have the honor or being

1289
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:31,120
here with with sadie

1290
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,679
and and with mark um so going to to the

1291
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,000
question

1292
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:35,360
uh sari and mark they they were thinking

1293
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,239
and they were asking about

1294
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:39,440
you know the the the amount and the use

1295
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:42,000
of apps

1296
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:43,360
uh and the data that they are collecting

1297
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,120
if you believe

1298
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:49,759
this uh data will be erased

1299
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:50,880
uh and also how do you see that things

1300
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:54,159
will change

1301
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:57,760
on the use of data in the future

1302
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:59,199
with that a we close uh this and and we

1303
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,560
will give the floor to the general

1304
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,320
director of pincive

1305
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,840
and to the ambassador of dominican

1306
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,040
republic to the oas

1307
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:07,040
mark why don't we start with you

1308
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:12,480
i think we're seeing a gradual shift in

1309
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,840
kind of the public view

1310
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:16,839
of some of the app ecosystem the web

1311
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,440
ecosystem

1312
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:21,120
where many many services that were

1313
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:23,120
offered for free

1314
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,719
were you know powered by advertising and

1315
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,800
advertising uh

1316
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:27,760
would mean the you know use in exchange

1317
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,159
of lots of

1318
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,520
potentially private information and i

1319
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,320
think people are beginning to wonder

1320
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,120
whether that

1321
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,799
might not be the best way forward and so

1322
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:39,679
i think you're beginning to see the rise

1323
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,440
of alternative uh technologies

1324
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:43,679
alternative approaches that

1325
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,719
emphasize more privacy and personal

1326
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,840
choice

1327
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:50,239
and you know a a little bit of a

1328
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,960
decline i would say in the interest or

1329
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:53,519
and the

1330
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,760
slowing of the growth of the world in

1331
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,159
which services are provided in exchange

1332
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:58,159
for

1333
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:59,280
um you know for quote unquote for free

1334
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:01,280
but really the

1335
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:03,280
user's behavior becomes essentially a

1336
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,559
product that's sold

1337
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,559
you know there's nothing wrong with that

1338
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,880
and if it's done well and with the right

1339
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,199
uh

1340
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,719
user consent it's been a successful

1341
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,919
model and lots of good has been

1342
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:13,520
accomplished by the

1343
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,360
provision of the free services in an

1344
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,760
advertising supported way

1345
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:20,159
but i think as as we go forward we have

1346
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:22,320
to begin to think as a community about

1347
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:23,839
with as the interest in privacy and the

1348
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:26,000
realization that privacy is a very

1349
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,360
fundamental human right as that grows

1350
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,280
we're going to need to come up with

1351
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,880
better mechanisms which enable people

1352
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,559
both to get the the kinds of services

1353
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,840
they want and they need

1354
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,600
but in a way that gives them more

1355
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,800
control more visibility

1356
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:41,199
and that's i think an evolving landscape

1357
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:43,360
um but i think that the future will

1358
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:45,199
involve more control more privacy for

1359
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:47,599
for end users and consumers

1360
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:48,320
and um their data i think will continue

1361
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,159
to be

1362
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:52,400
um there'll be a trend towards better

1363
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:55,040
protection of that data

1364
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:57,199
great thank you mark city final words of

1365
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:00,480
this final analysis of this bootcamp

1366
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:02,320
to you thank you thank you and and

1367
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:03,678
um mark that was a really brilliant

1368
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:06,799
intervention

1369
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:08,320
i i look forward and i hope for a future

1370
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,600
where people

1371
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:13,440
um demand more um

1372
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,040
say over their data and i think we

1373
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,080
should be mindful of the fact that

1374
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:19,679
consent

1375
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,880
has to be informed for it to be real and

1376
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:22,800
one of the problems we've had

1377
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:25,520
historically is that we've operated with

1378
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:27,199
blanket consent that's lasted forever

1379
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,520
and people literally forget what they've

1380
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:31,519
done and they don't really know where

1381
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:35,360
their data is and so

1382
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:37,199
i hope we move towards a future where um

1383
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:39,199
things are simplified and that people

1384
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:42,080
really engage with it

1385
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:42,559
they share it it will have higher value

1386
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,800
and

1387
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,560
um that we will still see the same kind

1388
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,920
of creativity and innovation around

1389
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:52,080
digital services

1390
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:54,320
but do so in a way where individuals are

1391
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:55,440
participating in a really meaningful

1392
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:58,159
sense

1393
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,799
and um and i think that what we heard

1394
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:01,920
about

1395
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,000
colombia's attitude uh towards what they

1396
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,800
have launched in their um the covered

1397
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,920
app

1398
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:10,400
was really positive and and some of the

1399
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,920
considerations that were being given to

1400
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,120
the kinds of principles that need to be

1401
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:15,120
adopted

1402
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,480
when we collect data when we use data

1403
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,840
the conditions under which we should

1404
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:20,400
make promises about

1405
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:21,199
no longer using it so i'm really

1406
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:24,320
optimistic

1407
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:25,678
