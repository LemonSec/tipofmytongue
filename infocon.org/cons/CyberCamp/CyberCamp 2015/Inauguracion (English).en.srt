99
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,479
we organize from the National Institutes

100
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,099
of cybersecurity with the same that

101
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:00,849
difficult as well as essential objective

102
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:03,860
that being that cyber security becomes

103
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:08,419
integrated in natural manner in society

104
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:11,060
we know and it is good news that

105
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:14,289
information technologies are an

106
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:17,389
essential parts essential components of

107
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:23,870
personal and work life and we are also

108
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:29,180
well aware that that requires good level

109
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:32,240
of trust and cyber security so that we

110
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,789
can make the most of all these potential

111
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,870

112
00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:41,180
objectives of habitable Camtasia as i

113
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,690
said before bringing cybersecurity

114
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,400
closer to the public in general

115
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:51,409
professionals entrepreneurs as well as

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:54,589

117
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:56,419
our server comes back slightly and now

118
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:58,460
we are closer to families we want to be

119
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:01,370
closer to families we wanted parents and

120
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:07,849

121
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:11,120
and to enjoy to enjoy family the offer

122
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:13,690
that we have designed and prepare

123
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,130
specifically for them what

124
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:24,890
so what is the National Institutes of

125
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:30,940
cybersecurity we are public and entity

126
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,940
so we depends on the Ministry of

127
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,580
telecommunications and we our objective

128
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:41,390
is to take care of cybersecurity we have

129
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:44,390
strong cooperation with other parties

130
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:48,710
and we also do research national

131
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:52,340
institutes of cybersecurity not only

132
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:56,349
organizes activities to foster the

133
00:06:52,340 --> 00:07:00,109
industry and industry in cybersecurity

134
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:03,860
but we also operate the sets of security

135
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:09,610
of industry which is the incident

136
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:16,550
response team aimed at preventing

137
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:19,460
helping and mitigating attacks attacks

138
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,930
cut it out all citizens industry and

139
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:28,430
especially strategic sector this search

140
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:31,940
which is operated by in civil it's also

141
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,590
operated with the Ministry of Defence as

142
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,750
I told you before coordination

143
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:39,500
cooperation is one of the main elements

144
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:41,620
of in civil our Institute and a good

145
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,690
example of that is the summation of

146
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,930
skills and competences and work that we

147
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:52,090
do together with the Ministry of

148
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:56,660
Interior and that is what I'll help us

149
00:07:52,090 --> 00:08:01,520
working together on a daily basis in our

150
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:10,420
endeavor to improve cybersecurity in our

151
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:14,240
country cyber come with consolidated

152
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:17,090
events already so this is our second

153
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,700
year and as you've seen in the video it

154
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:24,859
revolves around three access one of them

155
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:28,770
being generation of talent one in

156
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:32,400
it means that we want to amplify to

157
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,500
increase and enhance the activity

158
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,280
centers challenge that we carry out

159
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,840
during the year so we know that there is

160
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:46,350
a high demand full of professionals

161
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,650
specialized in southern security we know

162
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:54,420
that that demand is not met two hundred

163
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:58,170
percent hour days so therefore and we

164
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,240
have to start working from the basis we

165
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:05,400
really want to start working with those

166
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:10,380
who are jungles and we want to continue

167
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:14,010
along those lines so that in the near

168
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:17,760
future these young generations join both

169
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:21,630
the public and the private working world

170
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:27,930
so the second strategic elements is the

171
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:31,380
creation one generation of more wider

172
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:34,949
base of industries so we believe that

173
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,930
cyber camp and we're very good true to

174
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,300
amplify them to enhance all the work

175
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,880
that we carry our journey in the year so

176
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,000
these weekends we will have younger

177
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:55,110
people with good ideas getting together

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:59,100
meeting with investors entrepreneurs so

179
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:02,540
we will be making an effort to introduce

180
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:11,400
the public and private financing

181
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:14,250
mechanisms available we have to work

182
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,910
here the words of talents and the talent

183
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,940
of companies so for this second time

184
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,350
this year we have a firm where we will

185
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,890
be having the participation of more than

186
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:30,140
20 companies ready to interview with

187
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,140
candidates and two of job opportunities

188
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:41,449
this year we will be especially focusing

189
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:45,740
on families so this morning we have 1400

190
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:48,710
children around here working on

191
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,870
activities about cybersecurity so it is

192
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,900
very important not to forget about cyber

193
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,870
we had cyber scouts we have savage in

194
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,390
color we have very many such activities

195
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:01,760
for them and we will continue to do so

196
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:05,230
during the weekends and then parallel to

197
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:09,470
that we had workshops and workshops

198
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:12,380
oriented to hackers to experts and to

199
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:15,110
specialists for them to gain a deeper

200
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:19,330
understanding on the topic we will also

201
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:27,650
have other workshops some of them we

202
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:30,140
developed jointly with the oh yay so we

203
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:35,600
want cyber come to continue being a

204
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:39,949
valuable tool to society to all of us we

217
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,180
Secretary General of security mr.

218
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,180
Vasquez

219
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:40,220
whereas holidays good afternoon thank

220
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,390
you very much to all of you for being

221
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:46,370
here and as Bill Gates say and I think

222
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,910
this is a very of defamation he said

223
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:53,750
that thanks to the internet we can the

224
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:56,870
longer side I doesn't know now hard to

225
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,520
say I still don't know that one is

226
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,820
massive so most mysterious that is to

227
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,260
say that we are the protagonists well as

228
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:08,330
witnesses often an unprecedented

229
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:11,360
revolution in history we don't know

230
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:14,390
whether that revolution will take us and

231
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,650
according to that today we will be

232
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:20,720
having the opportunity to be passive

233
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:24,020
receptors and beneficiaries of the

234
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,630
knowledge generated by society but we

235
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,730
also have the chance and opportunity to

236
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,670
be generators and creators of that

237
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:35,200
knowledge so we'll have a well a window

238
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:40,160
open up to the whole world so this

239
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,440
positive revolutionary ambitious message

240
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,030
is the first thing that we'll have to

241
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:49,700
put on the table we should never

242
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:52,850
overlook this message when it comes to

243
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:57,410
approach the cyber topic because I were

244
00:13:52,850 --> 00:14:02,300
trouble means it quantitated leader in

245
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:06,860
the world in the way we are in society

246
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:11,390
today so me as the Secretary of State

247
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:14,120
for security well often we don't talk

248
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:17,000
about the good things about this other

249
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,740
world but about the bad things of sad

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,380
world we talk about cyberattacks

251
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:27,980
cybercrime very bad things that take

252
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,410
place on the internet but today this

253
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,170
integration of cyber can I don't really

254
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,439
want to tell you only about cyber

255
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:40,939
threats and cyber attacks we are all

256
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,649
well aware of the dangers that go hang

257
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,379
tent revival security today

258
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,589
I'd like to talk positive to you I'd

259
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:52,879
like to tell you about advantages

260
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:56,999
possibilities that we get from

261
00:14:52,879 --> 00:15:01,199
technology and cybersecurity so it is

262
00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:03,209
very good that all of us today here with

263
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,099
our different perspective who have a

264
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:11,758
different knowledge and fields of

265
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:15,629
interest we will be sharing our all that

266
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:17,850
and then we will be benefitting for all

267
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:20,970
the good things that the internet offers

268
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:27,089
to us so I'm not going to dwell in to

269
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:29,670
the negative so because today social

270
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:33,480
networks and the internet at a privilege

271
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:35,910
channel of communication of the law

272
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,209
enforcement agencies with the citizens

273
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:42,059
touch channel allows us to do things

274
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:44,550
that were just impossible to imagine a

275
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:47,040
few years ago social networks and not

276
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:51,300
only that but they are much more they

277
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:55,170
have been the deafening the revolution

278
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:59,099
of the way the police forces and law

279
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:02,878
enforcement agencies work nowadays they

280
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,970
have allowed what the devil to come

281
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:09,329
closer to citizens now they are using a

282
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:13,949
direct modern and Remiel language

283
00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:17,429
engaging with the concerns and the

284
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:22,019
interests of our society so that may

285
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:25,379
give you some figures so the Ministry of

286
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:28,999
Interior through the Twitter account and

287
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:32,730
the Twitter accounts of police forces

288
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:35,579
and civil word Civil Guards we had the

289
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:39,269
leaders of that network will have more

290
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:42,929
than two million two and a half million

291
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:46,949
followers national police forces are

292
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:49,549
proud to be the best followed police

293
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:53,819
forces all over the world and Twitter

294
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:55,779
even they they even have more followers

295
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:59,959
than the FBI

296
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:02,720
all these capacity capacity of using the

297
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,329
social networks on the internet to bring

298
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:11,110
together the public service of security

299
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:15,198
to citizens having already recognized in

300
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:17,029
well-deserved awards and prizes and I'm

301
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,549
sure that we continue to be like that

302
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:22,669
national marketing tries to police

303
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:25,369
forces as well as another price that

304
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:28,279
have been awarded this very same here

305
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:31,158
the internet and social networks

306
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:34,010
continue to be a resolution in the

307
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:36,919
strategy of communication of security

308
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,080
but they go beyond that now they have

309
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,090
become an actual operational jewel for

310
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,178
security they have increased

311
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:47,959
exponentially the collaboration of the

312
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:51,559
citizens with police forces Oh Guardia

313
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:56,120
Civil next to the opportunity of filing

314
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:58,940
reports of letting events known to the

315
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,149
law enforcement agencies through the

316
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:06,019
social novels nowadays law enforcement

317
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:08,809
agents can be faster more efficient can

318
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:11,149
protect us better and therefore cannot

319
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:16,220
protect in a more efficient manner the

320
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:20,870
security of people let me share piece of

321
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:23,559
data with you in January 2015 we started

322
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:29,889
an initiative to not have the

323
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:32,990
collaborators of citizens sounis fight

324
00:18:29,889 --> 00:18:41,750
drug dealing so we have received more

325
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:45,049
than 35,000 emails with information so

326
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:48,080
this is one of the few opportunities

327
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:51,408
that internet offers and puts at the

328
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,740
service of Public Security I also like

329
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:57,200
to mention to do other crops which is

330
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:03,139
mobile telephone application which is an

331
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:05,060
example on technology applied to

332
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:08,669
security so

333
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:11,700
haller cops on our smartphones allow us

334
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:14,910
to have direct communication with wider

335
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,660
severe and national police forces which

336
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:21,420
is suing way accessible to disabled

337
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,700
people through an instant messaging

338
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:26,340
system and also available in several

339
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:31,860
languages because we also wanted to

340
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:35,100
reduced by tourists so therefore we want

341
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:40,770
to bring security closer to citizens

342
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:44,310
through new technologies we have had

343
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:49,470
more than 33,000 zen loads and we have

344
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:55,919
received more than 22,000 alerts so for

345
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:57,990
35 out of 4 35 out of 5 this is the

346
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,230
rating on the scale in terms of the

347
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,470
usage made by citizens and we will

348
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:07,350
continue to add all the functionalities

349
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:11,840
that we believe are necessary to ensure

350
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:15,090
closer prox closer security of to

351
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:20,060
citizens and actually one of the most

352
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:23,550
recent functionalities was received last

353
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:27,899
Wednesday it was international day to

354
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:31,080
fight violence statements against women

355
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:37,950
so we introduced a real icon and other

356
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:42,179
cops now any gender based violence

357
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:44,580
episode we reported firstly on that

358
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,990
application we continue welcome to

359
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,429
improve the security of children and

360
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:55,830
adolescents we have from the previous

361
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:59,580
because about security and adds families

362
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:04,280
and children they all populate the

363
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:08,010
Internet's young people sometimes have a

364
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:11,760
virtual life which is some some

365
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:15,840
occasions more intense than the real

366
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,320
life so we would like to warn them about

367
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:23,629
the threats that they may face in the

368
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:29,639
virtual world last year law enforcement

369
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:34,590
agents gave more than 25,000 speeches

370
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:39,260
our schools and educational centers so

371
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:43,830
we can say that more than half of those

372
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:48,780
speeches had to do with cyber Harrison

373
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:53,189
and two cyber threats in order to ensure

374
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:56,670
a safe virtual environment to the

375
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:59,280
youngest cyber juicers so we believe

376
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:02,130
that initiatives of this kind are who

377
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,070
are more necessary we also collaborate

378
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:08,310
with industry to block pornography

379
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,740
content and to protect the security of

380
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:13,710
the minors on the internet we do that

381
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:16,970
through all the stakeholders involved

382
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:19,910
and we are also participants of

383
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:24,240
international initiatives European

384
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:27,930
initiatives those launched in Europe and

385
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,970
as well as in the US will have taken

386
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:33,480
part actively in all of these

387
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,940
international activities so we from the

388
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,100
law enforcement agencies we want to

389
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:41,010
prevent we have launched an individual

390
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,980
campaign target is a young population

391
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:47,070
perhaps you've seen it's at metro

392
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:51,330
station at train stations soon they will

393
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:54,929
also be shown on cinema theaters it will

394
00:22:51,330 --> 00:23:01,280
be Jews we will reduce like very basic

395
00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:05,550
and visual messages just offer basic

396
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:09,379
protection measures to know share keys

397
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:11,389
Oh be careful with the web cams etc

398
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:15,249
magenta

399
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:18,799
all this takes us to say that insecurity

400
00:23:15,249 --> 00:23:22,070
as well as another field social media

401
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,619
and the internet and making citizens

402
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,109
more more stronger they are empowering

403
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:29,718
them they are not only passive

404
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:33,049
beneficiaries and receptors but they are

405
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:35,329
also creators and generators as the

406
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:38,029
general director of in civ invention

407
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:42,950
before this is a wonderful example of

408
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:47,119
the most empower citizens that we have

409
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:51,440
that we are all are on the daily basis

410
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:56,089
so the images of the cuts that have been

411
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:59,089
populated that have populated the social

412
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:02,029
networks over the last week are a good

413
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:05,869
example of that powerful citizenship

414
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:09,649
that operates on the internet and that

415
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:14,299
is against any type of crime Internet

416
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:15,908
has changed our world and we can see

417
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:19,070
that in a greater transparency

418
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:22,309
transparency and participation arrogance

419
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:25,689
myths general FEMA director general of

420
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:30,259

professionals current professionals and

450
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:16,940
future professionals this sector this is

451
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:19,490
also plays for dissemination and

452
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,770
awareness raising awareness racing is

453
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:24,950
very important because we have to be

454
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:28,309
well aware about the need to have an

455
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:31,880
adequate level of chests when it comes

456
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:36,039
to using a new technologies this is one

457
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,039
of the craziest challenges ahead of us

458
00:26:36,669 --> 00:26:46,070
in so much we are moo moo digital it

459
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:48,530
becomes also more and more importance to

460
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:53,049
stablish and to put in place the right

461
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:56,510
security measures that shot successors

462
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:58,460
internet users in the online world the

463
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,799
same as in the physical world there are

464
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:03,890
many tools that help us protect someone

465
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,260
sells however further choose those tools

466
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,990
to be effective we have to go back to

467
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:12,530
the term that we mentioned before

468
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:16,059
awareness raising of all of us well same

469
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:20,600
as you don't leave you home

470
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:23,178
underneath the match no your home we

471
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,600
have to be very well aware of those

472
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:28,760
elements that put us as this so

473
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,820
therefore dissemination of information

474
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:35,120
organization of events of this time type

475
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,550
become more and more paramount so a

476
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,559
higher proportion of the population is

477
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:43,820
when aware of those risks and acts

478
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:47,420
accordingly still there is way to travel

479
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:49,790
we have to travel that path fast because

480
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,309
the utilization will be faster and

481
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:55,909
faster and we will have a higher number

482
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:58,790
of people and devices connected so

483
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:02,240
therefore we have to set basis to ensure

484
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:05,149
that all these developments take place

485
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,750
in a safe environment for that we need a

486
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:12,740
powerful cyber security sector as well

487
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:16,100
as an where society perhaps this is not

488
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:18,679
new to some of you because we have

489
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,928
already identified those two elements in

490
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,870
the digital agenda that we approved for

491
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:27,350
his painting 2013 that agenda has a

492
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:33,530
special plan aimed at approaching cyber

493
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:35,899
security so this plan established the

494
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:42,110
measures and the strategy of the

495
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:48,230
European and national security strategy

496
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:51,559
to ensure safe use of Internet over this

497
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:55,490
year our actions have focused on 2 May

498
00:28:51,559 --> 00:29:03,160
lane a line of actions first of all

499
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:07,820
investments of infrastructures to also

500
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:10,429
attracting an talents seconds fostering

501
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,620

567
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,640

568

569

this is the first day of cyber camp how

573
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:13,090
are you doing in cybersecurity but but

574
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,210
is the password for your mobile phone

575
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,340
I'm

576
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,710
to discuss it to do I once I you to do

577
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:22,010
good good good good level of security

578
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,750
all right she's learning and we are all

579
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,810
learning well and perhaps because you

580
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:29,960
are all hackers theses just talk to you

581
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:33,139
but I'm sure that people and don't know

582
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,540
that how can you remember your password

583
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:38,120
oh I shouldn't be saying that I have a

584
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:40,399
single password for everything no no

585
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,219
that's really really bad rule number two

586
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,480
do not use always the same password so

587
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:49,220
my password is five assists and then

588
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,310
when I go I said you have forgotten your

589
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:55,460
password and then it gives me 5 asterisk

590
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,960
and say oh yes with a good reminder so

591
