00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:44,350
to child pornography financial fraud

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:47,979

something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they award</font>

36
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:12,220
and I've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in bitdefender i'm a bit</font>

37
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:15,550
defender of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the homemade viruses I work</font>

38
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,070
in working an incident response team in

39
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:22,560
Romania and I've all and that's been a

40
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:25,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">very enriching work to see how the</font>

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,220
baddies go into the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> of virus and</font>

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,280
in the world of antivirus it's really

43
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,109
interesting to see and so I've got this

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,540
blog connects your name better right now

45
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,760
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't write much there at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font>

46
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,980
but hopefully in the future I'll be able

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to include the cases I have at the</font>

48
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,329
moment it's kind of technical blog with

49
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,160
some simpler elements so that can also

50
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,740
be of interest to people who are looking

51
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,720
to start off in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this world I'm still</font>

52
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,590
learning and I like to teach so

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,990
therefore I consider it important to

54
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,640
give something back to community and

55
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,190
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learnt as well I've</font>

56
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,779
participated<font color="#E5E5E5"> in different conferences</font>

57
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,150
national and international with weird

58
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,840
strange things different projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

59
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:10,630
I'm still waiting for one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my patents</font>

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">for security systems to be approved and</font>

61
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,410
as you know here in Spain justice

62
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:16,630
justice and bureaucracy is slow here but

63
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:20,380
I'm working on that they're getting that

64
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:23,079
patented and I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a little</font>

65
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,519
bit about how I see security right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,209
and we're also going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about what</font>

67
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,450
instant response is what is this concept

68
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:34,150
it's really new and in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

69
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,980
as well it's relatively new it's been

70
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,180
around for around five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

71
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,220
United States where they've really

72
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,440
become aware of it and here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

73
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,489
really got started yet in Spain but I

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,780
think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be something really</font>

75
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,310
important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next few years it's</font>

76
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,799
going to be all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about having</font>

77
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,690
multidisciplinary teams who can work

78
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:54,910
with ha kinetics malware analysis

79
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,320
and just programming so we're talking

80
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">about all of the measures that can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,799
used and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

82
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,690
anatomy of extortion I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

83
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,020
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple things i always say oh</font>

84
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:10,690
I'm so lucky that I have to work at

85
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,580
night I you know all my things go on at

86
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,959
night in other countries and here we can

87
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,930
see what happened and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

88
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,670
evolved in order to eliminate well not

89
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,470
eliminate but you'll see that depends on

90
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,800
lots of factors but at least to reduce

91
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:31,270
the impact and on the other hand will

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,710
talk about attacks using hidden channels

93
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,620
and there are some things that the tools

94
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,299
you know cannot get<font color="#CCCCCC"> close to and the</font>

95
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,370
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we have right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

96
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,170
brain that's what we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

97
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,640
people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

98
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,950
to use our brains<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,400
talk about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current situation of</font>

100
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:53,640
security the situation nowadays I always

101
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,640
like to

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,910
talk about cuttings articles from

103
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,909
newspapers so take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these and</font>

104
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,910
information

105
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,150
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about cyber spying there's</font>

106
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:16,049
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a golden period but now everybody</font>

107
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:25,440
has become aware this is from 2013<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

108
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:26,699
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Islam makino extremism hadn't</font>

109
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,910
really been talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about we were talking</font>

110
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">about using encrypted systems and we</font>

111
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,560
know that Isis right now works in a

112
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:37,740
different way but we we've got talk here

113
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,880
of the etta terrorist group which now we

114
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,990
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear much about because it</font>

115
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">practically doesn't exist anymore so if</font>

116
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,300
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about electronic security they</font>

117
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,330
say that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem and I could</font>

118
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,479
tell you an anecdote which dates back to

119
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,849
2010 when I was with one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the left the</font>

120
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,479
leftenant kernels and I said we've got

121
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:02,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you know get things you know get</font>

122
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,219
ready we've got the Chinese with a cyber

123
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:08,340
army and the guy said look<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

124
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,090
window what can you see and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

125
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">so just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tanks a few planes and he said</font>

126
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,960
how are they going to attack us how can

127
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:19,050
they attack us we've got planes tanks

128
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,510
it's impossible<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that was the culture</font>

129
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,639
that existed<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that time and the battle</font>

130
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:27,860
was mirror face to face or using bombs

131
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:31,159
not anymore no they attackers

132
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,539
you know they use social networks they

133
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:36,379
promote themselves through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font>

134
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:38,539
networks they're really not visible and

135
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:40,520
it's changed and if there's a third

136
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:43,699
world war it's going to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

137
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:48,530
way and then you can see how we'll see

138
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:51,439
how it ends but really we're starting to

139
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,059
have concepts that start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know</font>

140
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,479
computer concepts if you think of the

141
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">United Kingdom they contract that I'd</font>

142
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,878
heard this news a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of years ago</font>

143
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:05,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">they hire or they contract hackers to</font>

144
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:08,210
defend their country<font color="#CCCCCC"> and here nowadays I</font>

145
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:10,909
hear some<font color="#CCCCCC"> news a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago that</font>

146
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,520
we get hackers from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> East that they</font>

147
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:17,029
hire hackers from the east are they

148
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,909
better than us no I you know in Spain we

149
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:24,349
have very good people really good do we

150
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:25,909
have to go to East Europe or is that

151
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:27,710
just as me know if I like a smoke screen

152
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:30,379
and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually taking people from</font>

153
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,279
Spain but if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get people</font>

154
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,870
you know you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get people from</font>

155
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,069
abroad to defend your<font color="#E5E5E5"> country when</font>

156
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,009
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got really good people in the</font>

157
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:40,039
country so that's what I argue at least

158
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,870
and these dates back to 2013 what we've

159
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:47,089
got here on the screen and things

160
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:48,800
progress this is in the bay<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we have</font>

161
00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:50,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">a tax the banks defend themselves what's</font>

162
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,000
happened in Spain well what happens in

163
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:56,000
Spain is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody has really taken</font>

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,629
cyber war or cyber defense seriously

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">nobody's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking it seriously not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

166
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:03,050
the politicians wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost nothing but</font>

167
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,469
I mean even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this area even less than</font>

168
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:08,150
the rest of things but everybody's kind

169
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:09,589
of done their own thing and the ones the

170
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,779
companies organizations that have a lot

171
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,969
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to protect</font>

173
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:19,430
with knowledge with people but those

174
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:21,469
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have that well you know</font>

175
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:25,479
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> no chance if we're talking</font>

176
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:27,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a normal product to protect a</font>

00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,500
100,000 euros at least if you talk to

179
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,060
somebody who makes iron that they have

180
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,870
to spend hundred thousand euros to

181
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:44,969

188
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:09,000
Americans from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence service</font>

197
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,490
whenever we like that's what they were

198
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,730
really trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say it's a little by</font>

199
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,020
little we've kind of woken up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

200

start to have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information here we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to take it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seriously but I'm going to</font>

204
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,890
talk about everybody else I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

206
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,959
sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and this is a culture that we</font>

207
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,570
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to change stoke the more</font>

208
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:58,319
problems i have in my organization if i

209
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:01,209
share my problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people the faster</font>

210
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a solution</font>

211
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,138
but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spanish culture we find that</font>

212
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:07,029
difficult and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could almost say also</font>

213
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Mediterranean culture for the</font>

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:10,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mediterranean cultures it's difficult to</font>

215
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">say I've got a problem how can we solve</font>

216
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,149
it and we still have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of incidents</font>

217
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:21,489
so this guy well he got<font color="#E5E5E5"> his act together</font>

218
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:23,949
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he says come on then let's instead</font>

219
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:28,089
of using cannons we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

220
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:32,199
what this is all about with<font color="#E5E5E5"> IT learning</font>

221
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:34,809
map better<font color="#E5E5E5"> splode how can we you know</font>

222
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:38,410
enter this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> take it seriously and so</font>

223
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:41,019
here they create together with<font color="#CCCCCC"> NATO they</font>

224
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:46,230
create cyber defense teams with people

225
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:49,170
who are very specialized and both police

226
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,850
Civil Guard they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-prepared</font>

227
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:56,259
regardless of whether they may have a

228
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:59,199
lot of work a lot of cases and we have

229
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:01,449
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though we've arrived a bit late and</font>

230
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've taken our time you know taking a</font>

231
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:09,790
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an effort but we are prepared and</font>

232
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:12,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">this shows that all of these things that</font>

233
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,480
are happening well you know to deal with

234
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:15,719
them we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get our act</font>

235
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,059
together because we've got the attackers

236
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:23,170
and new generation attackers as I call

237
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:24,819
them and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> use apt concepts they</font>

238
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,479
don't we're not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about normal</font>

239
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:32,349
kind of intrusion or intruders you know

240
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,079
the age of hackers has come to an end

241
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one who would enter a server and</font>

242
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,339
said look how good I am look how bad

243
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,619
your security or defense system is it

244
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:43,839
was all<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their ego because it was</font>

245
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:47,170
it was a real hacker you know somebody

246
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">he was studying that field but now they</font>

247
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,160
are hired they are contracted by the

248
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:53,709
Mafia by governments we talk about a

249
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,889
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept of hacker</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

250
00:11:53,709 --> 00:12:02,939
therefore they develop much more complex

251
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:05,350
tools and here we have an apt why well

252
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:07,059
I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to intrude know what I</font>

253
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,920
want to do is to enter and stay there

254
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,259
and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop and how I'm</font>

255
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,740
gonna do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm going to do that with</font>

256
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:18,999
malware I'm gonna hide myself I'm going

257
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:21,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">to remain inside or behind that</font>

258
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:23,259
insulation for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm going</font>

259
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:25,240
to gather date a little by little I

260
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:28,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want money I want information and</font>

261
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">that makes it much more complex if we</font>

262
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:34,019
want to detect malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going to</font>

263
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:34,019
talk about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of examples</font>

264
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,790
so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that require it requires</font>

265
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:43,500
monitoring it needs to be constant

266
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:47,969
monitoring some people say hey I've

267
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:50,070
created a tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is amazing and when</font>

268
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,480
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an attack you're going to see a</font>

269
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,280
screen telling you that they're

270
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,070
attacking you well you can forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

271
00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:01,439
that the perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool does not exist you</font>

272
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,760
might be talking about malware apt in

273
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,250
the machine which she's been connected

274
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,900
with China and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the China is called Shen</font>

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,660
Luo the Chinese person is called Xin Liu

276
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,709
no no we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about that we're</font>

277
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,170
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

278
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,780
intelligence which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the</font>

279
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,360
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is important what's</font>

280
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,740
important is well<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we have to look</font>

281
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">at where are they attacking their</font>

282
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,310
attacking critical infrastructures these

283
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:29,010

284
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:31,459
organizations and bodies and here people

285
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,460
perhaps

286
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:41,940
people perhaps may give their<font color="#E5E5E5"> money or</font>

287
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,130
their data that might still happen but

288
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,020
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we're talking about companies</font>

289
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:48,420
and institutions the degree of awareness

290
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:52,340
is different and we've got lots of

291
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:56,610
things we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> products brands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> models</font>

292
00:13:52,340 --> 00:14:02,450
concepts UTM firewalls all that kind of

293
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:07,080
thing and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a cocktail shaker</font>

294
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:09,810
you know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about computers well</font>

295
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,090
in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> security was easier it was</font>

296
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:15,089
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just had intruder detection</font>

297
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:18,680
behind the firewall you had these kind

298
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:21,150
of protected systems with antivirus

299
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,030
software but now antivirus needs to be

300
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:26,430
certified<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

in order to use the console to deploy

305
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,050
the ages I mean you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to study a</font>

306
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:39,210
master's degree to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

307
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:42,359
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and i can multiply that by the</font>

308
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,340
far wall and by the intruder detector so

309
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually you need such a wide</font>

knowledge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,150
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so please bear this in mind</font>

316
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,219
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this applies wall technologies we</font>

317
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,350
have now legs Nets will see a short

318
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:16,220
example about how this is easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to escape</font>

319
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:22,390
and the techniques which is quite funny

320
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:26,510
so there are few for<font color="#E5E5E5"> antimalware bronze</font>

321
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:28,939
and these are easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> know by touching a</font>

322
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,950
bit of the code saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

325
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:43,550
have they called sandboxing if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font>

326
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:47,660
program here i have a malware and I'm

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:50,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna say okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the bad guy knows who</font>

he may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to evolve is too so these</font>

330
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:00,830
techniques will lead you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that so</font>

331
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:04,730
often technology as we usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is a</font>

332
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:07,040
textbook tool but is not a solution this

333
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:11,060
why we harm is so called cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> incidence</font>

334
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:15,050
response teams who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who</font>

335
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:18,349
have that ability of all that knowledge

336
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,120
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not speaking about myself I'm</font>

337
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,950
human and I do make mistakes but

338
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,260
initially gives us the capability of

339
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,750
having a global perspective in the face

340
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:30,380
of an attack and how to minimize it

341
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,810
minimize the response time to do so we

342
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:37,490
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about cyber incident response</font>

343
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:39,300
the concept is very clear it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this no</font>

344
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:44,410
more

345
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:46,120
he's not a group of researchers who set

346
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,969
up the camp there when there is a fire

347
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,370
know there is a fire I get told I'm the

348
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:56,740
first into the intervention I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I</font>

349
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:58,449
put out the fire and I'll leave item

350
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,300
mind about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> site of a place</font>

351
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:04,780
afterwards<font color="#CCCCCC"> nows this cyber incident</font>

352
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,730
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory the ante incident</font>

353
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,168
response team the first team that has

354
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,480
there whenever there is an incident

355
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:12,159
which is a team that suffers mouse be

356
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,220
holy because here we talking about the

357
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:17,709
fire fire burns if it burns you you get

358
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from it we put water on it and you</font>

359
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,789
go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're at a company</font>

360
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you have an attack here are the</font>

361
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:25,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">financial director the general director</font>

362
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:30,039
the company president they're all on top

363
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:33,280
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you why me what have they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stolen well</font>

364
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:38,408
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just got here but why and they keep</font>

365
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:40,210
asking you funny questions and you could

366
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,760
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a bit more ethereal in this</font>

367
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,740
regard so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our problem we are</font>

368
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,950
firefighting team we know how to put on

369
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,690
fires we will not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ease to</font>

370
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">reply some questions sometimes in the</font>

371
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:56,409
will will try to solve them obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

372
00:17:52,780 --> 00:18:00,129
what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the firefighting team does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

373
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:03,370
analyzes I do it what's the comparison

374
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,190
they contain and they solve so they

375
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:09,039
contain for the fire not to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> spread</font>

376
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:11,320
they solve the part that is some fire

377
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,149
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot solve the infrastructure of</font>

378
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,240
your organization because maybe badly

379
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:19,689
designed

380
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,330
so an incident response<font color="#E5E5E5"> team is a team</font>

381
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:26,230
that Gaza tries to put out the fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

382
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:30,389
we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from there they're wrong</font>

383
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:33,400
we see the measure that may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied</font>

384
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:38,050
in a real example you've seen very often

385
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:41,200
on TV when the fire is we'll put out

386
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,450
after a few days a firefighter goes to

387
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,920
check the building's infrastructure

388
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:50,620
their research fire check whether it was

389
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,940
much too<font color="#CCCCCC"> late it and that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

390
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,409
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of cyber means in</font>

391
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,850
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> but firefighters are not</font>

392
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,330
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it anymore they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just put it</font>

393
00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:02,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the difference in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IT part is</font>

394
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:05,710
that we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ax among turn</font>

395
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:09,010
off the router or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

396
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:11,650
turn off amazon now that's not what we

397
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:15,570
do we contain little<font color="#E5E5E5"> by little and we</font>

398
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">think on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vick technology that person has</font>

399
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,980
out how difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is have an idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

400
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">might say well half a lot or half line</font>

401
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,680
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's a changing the</font>

402
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:29,230
mindset here I'm certifiable you're not

403
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,550
so you need to say hey with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

404
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,860
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this please give me a</font>

405
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:36,190
hand well<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is 3am give me a hand</font>

406
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:39,010
anyway and this will happen a cyber

407
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:42,850
incident response team this seemed also

408
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:44,680
have great technical capabilities who

409
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,629
else is done we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be on the</font>

410
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,920
opposite side the incident is still

411
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:54,160
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if the incident is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still there</font>

412
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,620
he made happy may happen they can do

413
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,880
surveillance I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> locate and I cannot</font>

414
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,969
talk

415
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:05,250
so we need to learn about forensic

416
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,140
techniques and malware on attack

417
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,290
techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so appreciate its</font>

418
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,450
production techniques<font color="#CCCCCC"> antes denial of</font>

419
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:16,500
service and many different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

420
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:18,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be applied therefore we monitor and</font>

421
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,580
we say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> half part of the control</font>

422
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,190
here now I need tools for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this not to</font>

people know about locating is being at

428
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,560
the right time so that whenever this

429
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,200
happens we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an alert already and we</font>

430
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,889
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how to identify the alert</font>

431
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:51,390
this would be well have a scan I'll

432
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:53,520
ignore it but I'm having us come because

433
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,170
I'm deviating attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

434
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,120
attack that comes through another

435
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,480
network that is giving me a denial of

436
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:06,330
service or an intrusion and we need to

437
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:11,070
bird our perspective in mind so what

438
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:13,230
does 90 incident response team do

439
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,689
it solves everything we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see here and</font>

440
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,750
right now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

441
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:22,460

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:27,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">compromised assets illegal activity</font>

443
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:29,970
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything well policy email</font>

444
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,860
malware and many of them not much

445
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,220
between them so we're a mile work and

446
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,889
create an<font color="#CCCCCC"> isle of service or a leak of</font>

447
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,789
information directly we have quite a few

448
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:40,789
differences here

449
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,519
there are many incident types that may

450
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:50,860
be categorized with many different and

451
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:53,679
dark times so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to know them and</font>

452
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:57,039
these means that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a team that is</font>

453
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:00,220
multidisciplinary<font color="#CCCCCC"> and knows about this</font>

454
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,820
and there's very little on this so you

455
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,450
do encourage you please do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you</font>

456
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,590
feel like it so this can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> your future</font>

457
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:13,119
and there are people here who know about

458
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:15,189
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> initially we can not be</font>

with one and with many maybe depending

on the amount and the type of activity

473
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,379
they have an attacker is not just one

474
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,820
it's one of them and sometimes attacker

475

doesn't come from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside it comes</font>

so some people know about databases

other people know about malware

because this would be a high level level

happening so they are categorized at a

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the maximum level then we</font>

may lead to a bigger incident now we may

543
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,340
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying we might enjoy the incident</font>

544
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:45,789
with top of it to manage the crisis<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

545
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:48,250
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a response sometimes you need to</font>

546
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:49,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm down people saying nsit in the</font>

547
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:51,070
action plan you're going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

548
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,990
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this we're gonna apply</font>

549
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:55,330
that and this is useful for daily life

550
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,940
these are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the huge incidents</font>

551
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:01,449
any type of incident is useful so which

552
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,830
plan i'm going to am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have for</font>

553
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,200
a peace of mind of the customer or the

554
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:11,230
organization we tried to solve the

555
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:13,960
situation containing is solving that in

556
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:16,120
something nicebrad limiting it he's

557
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">already solving it it's not a spread in</font>

558
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,340
sideways anymore here's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like</font>

559
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,539
something is happening and I don't have

560
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:27,449
the control and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we solve</font>

561
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:31,059
how can I go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the former site</font>

562
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:32,770
this is kind of problematic sometimes

563
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,570
you cannot leave things as they are

564
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,350
because it depends on the organization's

565
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,668
infrastructure what is software

566
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,149
architecture of the development of third

567
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:43,950
party

568
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,540
stakeholders and then we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to inform</font>

569
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,309
and prevent and say okay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this not to</font>

573
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,280
and this will be the management side of

574
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:03,920
things so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of this actually that you</font>

603
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:49,570
we're getting a threat and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we only have</font>

605
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:58,659
do we do here and a massive environment

606
00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:01,030
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here credibility is given to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the threat a community is great here you</font>

procedure called<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's called that do</font>

610
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:11,260
this do that and as a reality when you

611
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,740
go with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might say okay let's sit</font>

612
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,870
down and see how we can solve face and

613
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:21,220
how we can adjust<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and then we look</font>

614
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:23,310
at the steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may be made first and</font>

615
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,450
very sensual we have executive meeting

616
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:29,110
need to get together with the owners

617
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:31,840
because there's a seizure making element

618
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:34,780
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot decide to turn all the</font>

619
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">servers of the router now this decision</font>

620
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:41,230
is made by somebody else so here we

621
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,660
salvaged which are the entry points in

622
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:47,700
the exit points we harm you know the

623
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:52,660
typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network map far from high above</font>

624
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:54,670
so which other risks if at 401

625
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,100
everything collapses what are the

626
00:30:54,670 --> 00:31:00,970
implications for this what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we losing</font>

627
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:04,178
and many people have assessed this

628
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:08,110
you know they say you know the people

629
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:11,429
who are mistrusting will have backup so

630
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:15,100
you have planned it you have it already

631
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:16,690
give these<font color="#CCCCCC"> prolapses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font>

632
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,939
emergency side you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> activate it</font>

633
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:22,720
business continuity you have another

634
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,250
alternative we think of the fall because

635
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,049
we don't yet now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this will happen</font>

636
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:30,760
we need to us as empowered which is very

637
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:32,470
important that is a risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously need</font>

638
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see whether we need to activate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

639
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece is continued</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if this is risk</font>

640
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,639
management some<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations have it</font>

641
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:42,669
and others however don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm from</font>

642
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:46,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">saragossa and there they tend to say</font>

643
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:48,669
like what risk management<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have an</font>

644
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:52,689
antivirus I have a firewall what are you

645
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:53,890
talking about so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a reality there</font>

646
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:57,130
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing that you need to apply your</font>

647
00:31:53,890 --> 00:32:01,570
knowledge in your techniques and hope

648
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:03,880
for the best second meeting so we now

649
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,280
know by the management which activation

650
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,710
we know and will<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do when you turn on</font>

651
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:12,539
and off your appropriate how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

652
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:17,230
organize it secondly how do we contain

653
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:20,049
so what was decided here basically first

654
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:22,270
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would wait to see what happens at one</font>

655
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:25,179
minute past four I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the logic</font>

656
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:26,830
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn everything off I don't know</font>

657
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,169
what will<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen if flood didn't manage</font>

658
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,580
another thing so what one minute minute

659
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:34,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">passed for who listen to what's</font>

660
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:38,999
happening and what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you here</font>

661
00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:41,590
was applying and controlling the system

662
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:45,940
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did basically I was following</font>

663
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:49,709
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we take control so all the</font>

664
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">security process of the organization</font>

665
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,139
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be monitored we're not the owners</font>

666
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,609
we will march with them and the people

667
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:59,709
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team of the</font>

668
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:01,418
organization is in charge of monitoring

669
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:05,200
that because that's why they know the

670
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:06,940
tool we cannot look at it with what's

671
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,919
happening so quickly so we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

672
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:13,419
attentive to<font color="#E5E5E5"> alerts to the updates we</font>

673
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:15,039
cannot part and make microsoft<font color="#E5E5E5"> patches</font>

674
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:17,710
in France sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we need to look into</font>

675
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">account the necessary purchasing in case</font>

676
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:22,769
I need to be applied because we still

677
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:27,729
don't know how the tank was made

678
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:31,779
passwords do we still have like one two

tell them in straight about this tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

681
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,889
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can still change them no no</font>

they're all good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they come back and</font>

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,179
there was some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of malware what else</font>

710
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:50,060
was a sad we had intruder detectors

711
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:52,280
focus on network traffic was quite

712
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:55,819
concerned because we considered the on

713
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:58,369
Tamar were was well defined and here we

714
00:34:55,819 --> 00:35:00,829
set up some sensors different sub

715
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:04,130
networks and what was done was to

716
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:06,530
compile the information in the case of

717
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:09,310
anomalies of problems the surprise is

718
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:14,569
that there were many problems happening

719
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:17,690
out of the attackers timetable disparate

720
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:19,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISM arrest because we saw that something</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">was happening with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> her first virtual I</font>

723
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:26,680
was happening

724
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,390
there was a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem or something</font>

725
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,009
wrong in the network traffic that

726
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:31,839
interview research in the reporting

727
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,190
eventually was an obligation giving

728
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,460
false positives but need to be

729
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:39,250
researched so this is categorized what

730
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:43,540
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do hear something the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> companies in</font>

half or something very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple the</font>

732
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:51,279
windows locks let's quickly set up the

733
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:55,450
windows locks mainly in the timetable of

734
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:59,020
the talk so we can sense in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sully this</font>

735
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:00,879
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very important because the</font>

738
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:09,850
I'm done so let's throw this in mind

739
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,120
this is a hard technology and miles of

740
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:15,310
them are organizations with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

741
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:18,609
technology window server allows you to

742
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:21,310
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's what we did also set up a</font>

743
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:26,290
server within the domain without naina

744
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:28,860
yes directly we do the forwards to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

745
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:33,400
server positions and the workstations

746
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:37,330
quite crazy actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I require support</font>

747
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,950
from the organization miss traitors so

748
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:41,460
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do with this information it</font>

749
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:46,450
needs to be exploited so<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">for seeing and we created the IC search</font>

753
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,839
open source may help some point in time

754
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,520
so we could have hard explain but since

755
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,070
this one was free and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

756
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,530
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because here we can</font>

757
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:05,320
put any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and was very</font>

00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,630
having a control panel a certain point

760
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:13,390
in time what does it we do on the

761
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,930
requests come in from the resolutions of

762
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,930
the dns

765
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:31,730
evolved this is an older version though

00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:35,450
needed to alter so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could have made</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">millions of requests and this gives us</font>

768
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,669
the perspective of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current requests</font>

769
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:43,360
and whether there was something is range

770
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:45,890
and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deployment was that awesome</font>

771
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:56,390
misconfigured in some cases what is on

772
00:37:45,890 --> 00:38:00,859
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 401 we all look like lace at</font>

773
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:02,420
years there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a big silence and no one</font>

774
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,030
was even breathing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> systems</font>

775

department<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the phones were ringing</font>

776
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,350
so imagine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fear</font>

777
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:14,640
hotfix was normal there was nothing

778
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,250
there the monitoring was done with

779
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,569
tivoli and everything was going well no

780
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:25,830
problem we didn't see anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 403</font>

781
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:29,060
fun enough not a 401<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a 403 we</font>

782
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:33,120
started seeing lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google requests</font>

783
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:35,040
all of a sudden and that is a certain

784
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:41,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">guyline was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok people are checking</font>

785
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:45,509
the email on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news youtube whatever</font>

786
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:49,410
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening and obviously checking the</font>

787
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:51,900
traffic increase we saw the HTT a PS and

788
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,649
we saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of it was coming from a</font>

789
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:58,770
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department and these shows you</font>

790
00:38:54,650 --> 00:39:00,870
the following hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think something is</font>

791
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:03,750
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on here that is currently traffic</font>

792
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:06,680
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe good and this traffic is good</font>

793
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:10,420
but what is happening here

794
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,419
I was art of seeing this

795
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:20,700
here i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an example with white shark</font>

796
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:26,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">over many requests regarding what was</font>

797
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:30,450
happening here so what do we do here in

798
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:34,350
this apartment<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're blocking a tool to</font>

799
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:37,980
monitor processes engage machine so what

800
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:40,319
we did here was to deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> zissman it's</font>

801
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,900
an open source tool that has saved our

802
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,180
lives we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know what was</font>

803
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,550
happening in that department why there

804
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:51,540
were so many requests and talking to

805
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:54,000
users some of them were in Gmail some

806
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,940
others weren't but in most machines we

807
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,070
had the same package of same<font color="#E5E5E5"> task</font>

808
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:05,510
packages to rule and this was quite

809
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:05,510
weird so sis mom as we see next

810
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,350
and here's a short video

811
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,118
so you can have a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

812
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:24,740
and this is a tool that we measure made

813
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:29,720
for this so this takes the windows loops

814
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:33,500
it passes them and need<font color="#CCCCCC"> structures that</font>

815
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,419
the executables go to a file<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay IP</font>

816
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,270
origin the origin I peace through

817
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:41,810
another time it's nation my<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace one</font>

818
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:44,690
other place a generalized is from sorts

819
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:48,640
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so get those executables he does</font>

820
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:52,550
a heart to calculate their footprint

821
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:57,440
understand to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> so towel as a first</font>

822
00:40:52,550 --> 00:41:00,560
help too so this mom is an agent from

823
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,840
sysinternals that allows you to trace

824
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,549
memory processes and there are

825
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:07,780
commercial processes are very expensive

826
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:11,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">petitions this month does it very easily</font>

827
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">so say okay does not get a license from</font>

828
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufacture is because usually takes</font>

829
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:19,430
six hours as get see small as a ploy on

830
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:22,250
this user network and let's apply with

831
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:25,009
these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> forces mum is collecting so</font>

832
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:29,170
his mom<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected processes and we saw a</font>

833
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,170
specific process that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite weird</font>

834
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:38,190
and funny enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could assess it</font>

835
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:40,680
afterwards or what we did here was we

836
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:44,040
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> touring a server together locks from</font>

837
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:48,779
the workstations we<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass that we put it</font>

838
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,759
in file on<font color="#CCCCCC"> txt files and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we did the</font>

839
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,130
houses of<font color="#E5E5E5"> loves executables and launch</font>

840
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,370
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this was long in parlor and he</font>

841
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:58,050
was left working and we kept researching

842
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:59,730
things didn't finish here this is

843
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:06,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will help us that is</font>

844
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:09,970
right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font>

845
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,970
show you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest</font>

846
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,270
I can't really seat properly

847
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:27,780
at some point you'll see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

848
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:31,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and this is a problem in one</font>

849
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:35,730
of the programs that we saw in the

850
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:37,560
machine the let<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> front previously</font>

851
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,950
doing the forensic analysis but look at

852
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:43,799
hays here they do their hearts<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font>

853
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:46,950
collected once i selected Santa to total

854
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,390
virus as the first tool an option and

855
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:53,060
there were many<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> belongs to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

856
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:53,060
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine 00</font>

857
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,680
can really advanced it otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go</font>

858
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:04,680
to naxos screen

859
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:19,390
well believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and you see the video</font>

860
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:21,520
later there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an out here sign</font>

861
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,319
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are 90 virus has detected a</font>

862
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:29,410
malware instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero we will shout</font>

863
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:31,800
one since we were running<font color="#CCCCCC"> late i'll</font>

864
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,799
continue

865
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:43,140
so what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> done next after total</font>

866
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:45,900
viruses one of them was deemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

867
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,839
suspicious and that is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> hint for me</font>

868
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:52,770
network traffic at the time the attacker

869
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:58,590
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker has some public to</font>

870
00:43:52,770 --> 00:44:01,380
sell anything yet https network traffic

871
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:04,980
increase and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as with forensic analysis</font>

872
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:07,230
that actually does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> acquisition so</font>

873
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:10,920
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does their position we use</font>

874
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:13,530
different technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's not</font>

875
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,890
think that there's a specific or

876
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:19,920
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange technology as you may</font>

877
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:21,850
see here because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

878
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,960
properly

879
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:24,960
but it's here

880
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:39,560
look it's on a video here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

881
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:39,560
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more click quickly</font>

882
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,169
aquilo que estoy haciendo simplement

883
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:56,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">esme be a recoger las adidas scripts hey</font>

884
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:59,440
I'm just collecting a series of scripts

885
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:04,000
this will be one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thousand free</font>

886
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,859
programs we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Allison shows</font>

887
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,490
here these just as an acquisition of

888
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:12,609
machine evidence so not using NASA

889
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:14,740
technology nASA uses is in technology

890
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:19,540
actually there is not NASA technology

891
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:22,209
these are scripts<font color="#E5E5E5"> CMD is the traditional</font>

892
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:26,140
ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really helped you in cyber</font>

893
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:29,880
response but the dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> vida so this is</font>

894
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:33,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we've always seen but you can have</font>

00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:36,280
acquisition the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ports dumping of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM</font>

896
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:41,410
memory and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we advance a little bit</font>

897
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:44,800
here we have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> executed script and we</font>

898
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:47,170
can see the memory dump oh it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

899
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:52,850
create a folder with all of the

900
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:57,030
information that's included in in that

901
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:58,710
and this script tells us how the script

902
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,480
is developing or evolving<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you were</font>

903
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:05,700
having any errors are appearing or

904
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:07,980
anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tools lit admit</font>

905
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,080
free tools I mean there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

906
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:12,740
strange here we're not talking about

907
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:15,930
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange and you can program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

908
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:19,020
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to include more tools if you</font>

909
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:23,240
want so just basically scripts i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

910
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to abort</font>

911
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:36,299
I don't know why let's see

912
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:42,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">well the screen I lost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen for a</font>

913
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:45,449
moment there but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now</font>

914
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:50,949
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about something</font>

915
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:53,890
which is what we call hidden channels so

916
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:56,140
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do the forensic and look at the</font>

917
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,819
evidence we find out wolf we say what

918
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:00,519
what we found here what we've got here

919
00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:04,269
and what we saw was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the attacker we</font>

920
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:07,558
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how but I imagine as in all</font>

921
00:47:04,269 --> 00:47:10,718
cases they had infected the machines

922
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,339
they had maybe an email<font color="#CCCCCC"> that had been</font>

923
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,829
opened or something I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're how</font>

924
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:15,999
it's very difficult to find out above

925
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">all if you don't have preventive</font>

926
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:24,069
technology if if you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

927
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:25,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">very difficult and so we thought about</font>

928
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:28,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">what this is all about these hidden</font>

929
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:32,170
channels and attackers are using this a

930
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:35,170
lot now and they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

931
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:38,140
increasing the use of this we've got

932
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:40,329
malware which has the leaking of

933
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:42,400
information or the theft of information

934
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:47,739
so we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about for example</font>

935
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the use of port 443 which has it</font>

936
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:51,430
might have an intermediary surgery or

937
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:54,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">there may</font>

938
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:57,098
and use social networks which is like in

939
00:47:54,849 --> 00:48:00,940
the case we saw so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of taking</font>

940
00:47:57,099 --> 00:48:04,780
the equipment do the reversing looking

941
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:07,150
at what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program did we said wow this</font>

942
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:10,059
has been near sir they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this really</font>

943
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:14,260
well and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology what did</font>

944
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:18,240
they use well above all social networks

945
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:22,809
which is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to not set off any</font>

946
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,189
intruder<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm triggers because it would</font>

947
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:26,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">be encrypted you'd have to have an</font>

948
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:31,359
intermediate<font color="#E5E5E5"> tour with certificates to</font>

949
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:35,170
get rid of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL and to re-encrypt it</font>

950
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:37,859
and send it doesn't so they had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

951
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,859
initially

952
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:45,770
that wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem and you can see</font>

953
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:48,940
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to do a demonstration it</font>

954
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:48,940
take because see that

955
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,790
I do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with out the video</font>

956
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,260
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have here</font>

957
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:08,170
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a form which is this one</font>

958
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:08,170
here

959
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:20,189
I've got hisses not to have to type<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

960
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:26,030
all in but what I'm going to do is is a

961
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:26,030
keylogger a malware with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google Forms</font>

962
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:33,530
so I'm gonna be the bad guy now so here

963
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have a form</font>

964
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,190
a title of the form

965
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:45,380
acme cool

966
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,380
question

967
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:06,630
our products good short answer

968
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:06,630
and I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> also add an image</font>

969
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:13,270
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've got this</font>

970
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:13,270
prepared for acne

971
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:21,819
I make it look<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

972
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:26,500
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm showing you a form this is a</font>

973
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:28,720
google class<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to answers</font>

974
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,360
so when the answers are written you're

975
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,419
going to create a spreadsheet and we're

976
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:37,170
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call that spreadsheet let's</font>

977
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,170
think on example

978
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:48,720
key log with<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3gs at the end will create</font>

979
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:51,120
and then i<font color="#E5E5E5"> have my formula in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my form</font>

980
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:56,490
created here we have the spreadsheet

981
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:58,810
where the results of the form will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

982
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:02,020
included<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can change the appearance I</font>

983
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:06,430
change the color and I send my send the

984
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:10,270
form and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we would send so</font>

985
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:13,330
that the receiver can send their

986
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:17,259
information using that form<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

987
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:19,150
copy so it says copy and now look at

988
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:22,740
this look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this carefully what I'm</font>

989
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,740
going to do now I come here

990
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:34,580
I go sorry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sender see ok</font>

991
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:40,340
control V so here we have the form and

992
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:43,370
here if I write in the answer clothes I

993
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:46,670
send it that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it to the Excel</font>

994
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:50,210
spreadsheet and then I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back to</font>

995
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:52,310
the start of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the form and you'll see</font>

996
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:56,270
here that it's been added and that's

997
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:57,440
your short course in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google so now we're</font>

998
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:01,090
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see something really</font>

999
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,090
interesting that these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

1000
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:08,220
so i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to edit the source code</font>

1001
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:13,600
you can see that i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the</font>

1002
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware which is decomposed and I've got</font>

1003
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:19,110
it all prepared obviously so that we can

1004
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:19,109
see it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is it</font>

1005
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:30,109
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> open it and edit it with the note</font>

1006
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:33,770
block and this malware well I mean what

1007
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:37,580
it does is capture the keys that are

1008
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:44,540
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used so it's a keylogger and it's</font>

1009
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:48,700
so simple that if we look here we have

1010
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:52,089
the send button very simple

1011
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:59,160
I can go to the source code I can do a

1012
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:59,160
search<font color="#CCCCCC"> form response in the lower case</font>

1013
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:05,390
and here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom at the bottom</font>

1014
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:09,670
right at the bottom i'm not sure if you

1015
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:15,999
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that i don't if you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1016
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:18,109
we take it we take this and we copy it

1017
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:20,808
you can't see very clearly obviously

1018
00:53:18,109 --> 00:53:23,180
from that distance but you can see you

1019
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:31,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">are mo it's gone yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's do it</font>

1020
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:33,950
again okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> control C I go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1021
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:36,309
source code of the application i come

1022
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:36,308
here

1023
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,670
ctrl<font color="#CCCCCC"> V</font>

1024
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:47,390
right I've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> button but now I have</font>

1025
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,580
to tell it which excel sheet i need here

1026
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:52,240
we can see it says entry plus a number

1027
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:57,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to search for that</font>

1028
00:53:52,240 --> 00:54:03,339
I come here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> search for it entry point</font>

1029
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:07,269
on this indicator is the sheet where the

1030
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:10,619
result will be positioned

1031
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:10,618
so I copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1032
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:16,020
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> taste it</font>

1033
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,390
I save<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and now we can see it</font>

1034
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,779
this isn't Python obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> a febrile</font>

1035
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:33,079
Python it would have been really it

1036
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:39,250
would have been really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy so now what</font>

1037
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to do is we open the session</font>

1038
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,350
obviously do anything anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can not</font>

1039
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:53,450
have to type<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in but here we go we put</font>

1040
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:59,900
in Python this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just an example so</font>

1041
00:54:53,450 --> 00:55:03,230
that you can get an idea k 3 so k3p why

1042
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:05,080
this is just to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well this works</font>

1043
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:06,980
in a moat because what we're looking at

1044
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,049
or looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

1045
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">to explain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1046
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:16,700
the managers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is a simulation of</font>

1047
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:20,540
what had happened so let's see here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1048
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:23,060
type<font color="#E5E5E5"> in remote enter the window</font>

1049
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:25,790
furnishes and I explain this to them you

1050
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:27,710
know I explain when you execute it oh

1051
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:30,980
you execute a program you don't see this

1052
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:35,200
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're executing it as a user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1053
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:38,500
then for example we could

1054
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:40,950
come here open a new one and first to be

1055
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,950
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it</font>

1056
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:51,400
you can see right this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a secret</font>

1057
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:55,700
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not optimized it's going to be</font>

1058
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:58,190
updated the malware isn't optimized it

1059
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,899
goes in each column but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1060
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:04,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">work for practical in practical terms</font>

1061
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:07,100
it's taking a little while to refresh

1062
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:09,650
but that's because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connection and</font>

1063
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:12,130
if not I'll do it myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's filled in</font>

1064
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:12,130
some of them

1065
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:16,029
and

1066
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:20,549
I've updated it i've refreshed it with

1067
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">f5</font>

1068
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:35,220
okay he could see that completely

1069
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:37,660
transparent transparent

1070
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:39,700
nobody

1071
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:42,970
knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was going to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1072
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:45,160
place and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technique what else</font>

1073
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:49,209
did we see well we saw that something

1074
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:50,799
had changed in the effective machines

1075
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:53,289
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought but what are they what</font>

1076
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:59,520
have they<font color="#E5E5E5"> done we saw that the browsers</font>

1077
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:59,520
were compromised if I minimize that

1078
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,169
I come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different demo so you can</font>

1079
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,169
see

1080
00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:10,558
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i open firefox</font>

1081
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:25,420
on this is XP XP<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a malignant or</font>

1082
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:27,670
a malicious extension I can say you know

1083
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">download the new application it's really</font>

1084
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:35,320
nice that we did or we looked at how the

1085
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:37,120
equipment have become infected but the

1086
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">average user for example doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1087
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:42,009
how to get rid of them and they don't

1088
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:43,780
even worry about that haven't you ever

1089
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:46,390
seen with may be with your family your

1090
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,520
relatives or a customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or somebody they</font>

1091
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:52,560
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1092
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:55,520
browser full of bars you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know everything</font>

1093
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,520
except good things

1094
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:05,930
so here we come I<font color="#CCCCCC"> drag it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm inhibit we</font>

1095
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:08,620
get this pop-up it it warns us but we

1096
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:10,750
have to imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1097
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:13,830
user says yes yes I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install</font>

1098
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:16,000
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they really shaped the restart</font>

1099
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:18,850
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done this in as a demonstration</font>

1100
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,530
here I am what this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be transparent</font>

1101
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:22,960
it wouldn't be visible here we're

1102
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:24,190
talking we've got a ftp and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

1103
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,780
cancel it we're gonna look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a</font>

1104
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:29,410
different way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to cancel it</font>

1105
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:31,870
it asks for the ftp password and user

1106
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:34,720
and then it talks about a configure

1107
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:36,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">essaouira setup file so this would be</font>

1108
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,520
transparent there we wouldn't see any of

1109
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:41,629
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't see any of that and</font>

1110
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,339
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1111
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:46,240
sent the information is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1112
00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:47,860
sent and so

1113
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,229
here we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a man in the middle or a</font>

1114
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:53,110
man in the browser so we've got software

1115
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:55,090
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle of the browser to capture</font>

1116
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:59,010
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the requests in such a way that</font>

1117
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:59,010
well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go here for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

1118
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:10,400
sorry I'm going to kill that process but

1119
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:10,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not letting me because it's writing</font>

and yeah

1123

and here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go we a type in PP at</font>

Mozilla Firefox profile I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> get them in</font>

1131
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:37,560
the end extensions<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a reverse</font>

1132
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:41,190
connection if i do a double click here

1133
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:47,279
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see we go to Chrome we go to</font>

1134
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:53,340
local we go to use and go to content ah

1135
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:55,290
there's a key log log HTML if i do a

1136
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:57,650
double click can you see that oh it's

1137
01:00:55,290 --> 01:01:00,450
very very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see it right</font>

1138
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:01,320
it's been saved at a local level but it

1139
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:04,669
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been done it could have been</font>

1140
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:07,500
sent remote so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> browser's were</font>

1141
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:11,650
compromised you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1142
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:15,690
lastly you know

1143
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:15,690
to top it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off we found</font>

1144
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:23,620
a tool in one of the machines which

1145
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:25,990
really you know just killed us and the

1146
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:28,569
antivirus hadn't detected it and we'll

1147
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:32,399
see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was doing now I'm going to</font>

1148
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:32,400
start a virtual machine

1149
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:51,109
I'm very basics you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got</font>

1150
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:54,038
Carly famous famous Colleen

1151
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:54,038
root at all

1152
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:18,880
here we're going to launch<font color="#E5E5E5"> a met exploit</font>

1153
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:34,660
and so we weird receives the exploit but

1154
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:41,410
here if we go to cynthy be so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go to</font>

1155
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:46,410
that folder demos we've got the putty

1156
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:46,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do two things first of all</font>

1157
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:55,270
they will leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one analyzing it</font>

1158
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:58,300
the antivirus and we're going to redo

1159
01:02:55,270 --> 01:03:00,850
that just in case reload and in the

1160
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:03,010
meantime while virustotal is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1161
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:05,670
we check it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to execute it</font>

1162
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:05,670
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meantime</font>

1163
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:11,900
okay see that

1164
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:20,160
applications of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> administrative</font>

1165
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:24,530
systems were compromised<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with a</font>

1166
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:29,029
difference of 4 k's but they allowed

1167
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:29,030
remote remote access to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine</font>

1168
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:38,160
yeah take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that mm-hmm can you</font>

1169
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,160
see that

1170
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:51,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">we could we've got the processes of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1171
01:03:47,930 --> 01:03:54,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">machine here and what's more what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1172
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:55,609
they in the applications it wasn't ass

1173
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:59,840
application that was compromised but

1174
01:03:55,610 --> 01:04:02,150
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't activated when i just</font>

1175
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:04,100
opened it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but rather when i click the</font>

1176
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:08,150
particular button and so imagine the

1177
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:12,589
degree of compromise that existed so if

1178
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:15,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">we go into virustotal we'll see relieve</font>

1179
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:17,710
it doing its job and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue so</font>

1180
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:21,520
you've seen that hidden channels

1181
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:21,520
practically invisible

1182
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:27,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">and having said that what conclusions</font>

1183
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,700
can be drawn

1184
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:35,299
well very easy first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys</font>

1185
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:38,419
know you know the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1186
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:40,520
had really worked it out in advance they

1187
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:42,799
will make you know knew where they had

1188
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:45,049
to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that malware so they had</font>

1189
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:49,670
prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> scoring of that information</font>

1190
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:52,369
they had found well well this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still</font>

1191
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:55,549
pending but I imagine they they had a

1192
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:56,930
fake profile linkedin they made

1193
01:04:55,549 --> 01:04:58,220
themselves a friend of a friend of a

1194
01:04:56,930 --> 01:05:00,828
friend in the end they send you an excel

1195
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:05,720
sheet and that's what it's all about so

1196
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:08,480
they developed silent apt which used

1197
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:13,520
really simple technique of using a form

1198
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:15,470
and in yahoo you've got database that

1199
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can link up and there is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1200
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:21,790
this out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in the end what they</font>

1201
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,790
did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> they achieved control</font>

1202
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:28,490
so they didn't produce anything at one

1203
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:32,960
minute passport or three minutes past

1204
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:35,180
four because there was a warning but if

1205
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,080
the warning hadn't reached us we would

1206
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:38,870
still wouldn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

1207
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:42,080
infected so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we think well we</font>

1208
01:05:38,870 --> 01:05:43,819
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go for</font>

1209
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,590
you you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are gonna go</font>

1210
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:46,730
for you you're going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1211
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:50,080
defend<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself you're gonna have to</font>

1212
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:52,370
fight but that's the way it works and

1213
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:53,870
latest technology in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own malware</font>

1214
01:05:52,370 --> 01:06:00,190
which is actually that's really simple

1215
01:05:53,870 --> 01:06:00,190
and let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Apriori</font>

1216
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:09,560
what I'll continue even though that's

1217
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:12,710
running in the background and<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1218
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,630
saying you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they can't be</font>

1219
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:16,910
detected by anti-malware and if we look

1220
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:18,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the instant response knowing looking</font>

1221
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:21,009
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic during the forensic work</font>

1222
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:23,660
taking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Machine doing reverse</font>

1223
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:26,420
engineering we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font>

1224
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:28,609
restrictive rules based on strings and

1225
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:30,920
the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the packet being sent the</font>

1226
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:33,110
destination where it was being sent so

1227
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:36,500
we can have contingencies in the

1228
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:39,230
detectors antivirus sandbox<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font>

1229
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:41,350
the guidelines for the malware and what

1230
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:46,940
we did was take a really aggressive

1231
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:49,790
approach we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> blacklists and we took</font>

1232
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:53,690
out our we eliminated we removed gmail

1233
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:56,020
and google in itself and we had a list

1234
01:06:53,690 --> 01:07:00,160
in the proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure it wouldn't</font>

1235
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:00,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open up</font>

1236
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,029
I see

1237
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:12,770
if I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something on my computer then</font>

1238
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:15,260
the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't do the same thing</font>

1239
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:18,280
I've I really find that a bit confusing

1240
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:18,280
but let's see

1241
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:32,130
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me be</font>

1242
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:35,100
zero out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 25 or 30 it doesn't find</font>

1243
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:37,980
anything and this is petty and petty

1244
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:40,520
works so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> malware's</font>

1245
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:46,230
that just produces an error no<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works</font>

1246
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:48,630
obviously you know as you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect well</font>

1247
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:51,090
I can guarantee you there there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1248
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:53,280
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero none of them see it and this</font>

1249
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:55,380
has been tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> with virus and also on a</font>

1250
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">battery of virtual machines with</font>

1251
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:02,580
antivirus because sometimes sometimes

1252
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:06,030
they might catch it but they were

1253
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:10,100
completely compromised and what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1254
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:10,100
allow us to do well it allowed us to

1255
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:31,500
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this because these screens</font>

1256
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:33,540
are getting me confused I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1257
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:38,310
where the mouse is that it was the

1258
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:39,899
screen synchronization isn't working so

1259
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:42,390
let's do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see it so</font>

1260
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:45,660
what was the conclusion then a lot of

1261
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:47,160
technology is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help because</font>

1262
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:49,439
when it comes down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there are</font>

1263
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:52,050
things that you're not going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1264
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,629
and the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones who can see it are the</font>

1265
01:08:52,050 --> 01:08:57,210
people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Incident Response the</font>

1266
01:08:54,630 --> 01:09:00,180
knowledge the expertise the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who</font>

1267
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:03,120
is working in instance who suffered

1268
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:05,250
other incidents and the things that

1269
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:08,160
would confuse others would set off a

1270
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:13,500
warning an alarm in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mind of the</font>

1271
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:14,880
instant response people others you know

1272
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,830
might not see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but we would be the</font>

1273
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,900
ones to say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not normal and if</font>

1274
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:20,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">people hadn't if in this case for</font>

1275
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:22,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">example if we hadn't received that call</font>

1276
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:26,490
it would have just completely gone and

1277
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:28,200
seen so I just want to stress that it's

1278
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:30,450
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about technology but it's also</font>

1279
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:33,120
about techniques and you know using<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1280
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:36,349
brains so with only<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there any</font>

1281
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions before we finish</font>

1282
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:43,759
we do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a microphone in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the room</font>

1283
01:09:39,089 --> 01:09:43,759
please make sure they use the microphone

1284
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:55,340
no solamente por curiosidad no intent

1285
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:56,420
our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> Athena did then just out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1286
01:09:55,340 --> 01:10:00,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">curiosity they're not trying to do</font>

1287
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:08,030
anything no they were there well they

1288
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:11,920
weren't in a clever enough to otherwise

1289
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:15,559
did you know we would have caught them

1290
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:18,530
since here was at 401 you know it was a

1291
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:20,630
401 we suddenly you know we were alert

1292
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:23,450
to the problem and so before they took

1293
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:26,870
any actions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand that they were</font>

1294
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:28,700
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish data I imagine but they</font>

1295
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:33,230
didn't have time because we filtered the

1296
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:37,210
proxies in exit<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 and so maybe they</font>

1297
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:37,209
changed their mind I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know why but</font>

1298
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:41,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">deleting on the hard disk yeah they</font>

1299
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:44,650
could have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they wanted yes</font>

1300
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:47,690
our idea is that they didn't actually

1301
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:49,009
formalize that extortion they didn't

1302
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:51,379
complete it they wanted to show how

1303
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:54,260
strongly were and since they didn't

1304
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:58,070
manage it and they stopped they because

1305
01:10:54,260 --> 01:11:01,370
we'd realized but if that had been kept

1306
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:03,259
silent then you know they would have

1307
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:06,140
threatened to publish it but know that

1308
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:09,360
it differently and thanks to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1309
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:13,500
managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> save the situation</font>

1310
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:15,990
that was at four and you found out about

1311
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that at 12 in order to carry out that</font>

1312
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:23,480
analysis of monitoring I mean helmet

1313
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:26,700
well we have 16 people bringing together

1314
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:29,490
no 16 people from instant response and

1315
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:33,269
the rest from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company or another 15</font>

1316
01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:35,630
or 16 we suffered we suffered yeah I can

1317
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:35,630
tell you that

1318
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:46,769
hit the capital down I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask how</font>

1319
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:51,960
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> users were compromised next</font>

1320
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:57,260
question I can't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that many many many</font>

1321
01:11:51,960 --> 01:12:00,780
many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> a financial department many</font>

1322
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:10,020
what he'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and could this kind of</font>

1323
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:12,840
attack be used as social engineering so

1324
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:14,640
that people might devote their i worked

1325
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,340
in one direction and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then enter by a</font>

1326
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,870
different place well we did think that

1327
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,850
could have been something lateral we did

1328
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:22,290
think yes they were trying to distract

1329
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:23,730
us with this and do something on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1330
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">other side yes that could have happened</font>

1331
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:27,409
but it didn't happen but it could have

1332
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:30,979
done yes

1333
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:32,929
