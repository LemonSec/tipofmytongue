1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
pero y buenas tardes a todos y como no

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:09,809
Sam presentado afternoon to you all my

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,230
name is fatty schoo Benitez Amendola

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,518
later we come from the technological

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,980
investigation unit of the National

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,830
Police Force when we were asked to take

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,390
part in this meeting in this seminar and

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:27,019
to give a speech we intended not to say

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,760
the same thing again we want our

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:32,850
presentation today to be entertaining

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,640
and we just don't want to end up being

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,360
two people here telling a story we would

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:44,250
like our presentation to be practical so

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:48,570
we will be sharing research case with

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:57,480
you but we will also tell you how we did

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:01:00,059
her research all right let us sell you

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,089
in chronological order how we cut it out

18
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,670
our research everything started when

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,540
someone was at home and got an email an

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,330
email that was sent by tor male network

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,560
and the wasn't attachments and it was a

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,840
video a video recorded by the victim

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,900
through a snapshot and this person was

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,830
asked to pay 10 bitcoins in less than 72

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,189
hours or that video will be sent out

26
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,579
soon his facebook contacts so this

27
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,559
person was very much as good because

28
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,360
he's you know what bitcoin was or

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,939
whatever so the first thing that he did

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:44,539
was a google search and then he finds

31
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:49,798
out about lots of malware cryptolocker

32
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:52,680
etc so tools blocking your computer and

33
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,990
asking you to pay in bitcoins so this

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,740
man got more and more frightened and he

35
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,179
decided not to pay up and then he

36
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:07,210
instead he came to a

37
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,460
national police station he told us what

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:13,540
happened to him and he asked us what he

39
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:17,110
had to do so we told him what to do so

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:24,370
we are the judicial police and for us to

41
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:32,020
start an investigation the only way for

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:37,209
us to do so is to have person reporting

43
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:39,790
decades so we got more information for

44
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:42,700
him as to what happens and he told us

45
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:48,160
that the video who was a pornographic

46
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:52,119
video and he was the video he was in the

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,850
video and as well as another woman the

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,520
woman was a former partner and they

49
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,870
hadn't split up two days ago so with

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,940
that information we started to link all

51
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,120
the events and the sake who could be the

52
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,180
person who is harassing harassing the

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,660
persons and then well the most logical

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:17,680
thing to think he's about the former

55
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:20,140
partner but perhaps that was not it so

56
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,260
in this situation so we always ask

57
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:27,070
questions to the stakeholders will have

58
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:32,980
the person reporting the event and then

59
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:36,190
the possible actor of the event then we

60
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:41,649
contacted the former partner however we

61
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:48,760
didn't have enough evidence and then we

62
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:53,650
just interrogated her as a witness so we

63
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:56,560
told the facts to the former partner

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,060
and she did not admit it she did not

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,239
claim any responsibility and she

66
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:07,689
collaborated in everything that we

67
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:13,900
demanded from her so she's God laptop as

68
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:17,738
well as a smartphone oh no he's okay

69
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,600
sorry he said mobile phone is not in the

70
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:22,870
smartphone he hasn't got an internet

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,630
connection therefore we focused on her

72
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:30,430
computer she offered us to access her

73
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:36,490
laptop so we analyzed her laptop we did

74
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:41,789
a forensic analysis and we could see

75
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:45,580
that the video had been on her laptop

76
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:50,919
however it had been deleted it haven't

77
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:54,460
elated when they is split up so the

78
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,109
former partner well and our

79
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,979
investigation with the former partner

80
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:02,610
was over because we could not detect we

81
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:08,080
couldn't say that it was her who

82
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:10,690
disseminated the video so we have now a

83
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,780
second at stake holder ok let us go back

84
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:17,979
to the best on reporting event he's got

85
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:22,299
a phone as well as a laptop so the

86
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:25,030
laptop volunteers and gave us all the

87
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:30,940
digital devices for us to research them

88
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:34,869
and then we waited for him to either to

89
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:38,830
see whether he just disability the video

90
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,770
perhaps to accuse his former partner or

91
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,800
if someone has stalled information from

92
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:48,880
his laptop so we contacted the person

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:54,030
presenting the report we analyzed his

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:57,010
devices well his laptop had some malware

95
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:01,049
however the man well that his laptop

96
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:03,279
hard was not a malware able to instruct

97
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,360
information it was just advertising

98
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,969
malware for statistics ok

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,590
so we could also finds out or we could

100
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:16,349
also conclude that the video did not

101
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,198
some out from his laptop however we also

102
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:21,000
have his mobile phone and we wanted to

103
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,250
see but I bad mobile phone had

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,500
interesting information for us to

105
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,569
explain how you can extract information

106
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,419
from the mobile phone so the best thing

107
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:34,199
to do it is just to show with demo so

108
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:36,568
this is my smartphone it says sony

109
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,029
xperia let us assume that this was the

110
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:43,430
telephone of the person reporting the

111
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:43,430
case okay let us take a look at it

112
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:34,240
the first thing that we do is to connect

113
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:36,460
his mobile phone to a virtual machine so

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,000
that we can access internal memory of

115
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:42,310
the phone this helped us finds out but

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:54,180
the user does and all the information in

117
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:56,740
the phone so once we are in the internal

118
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,410
phone there are two very important

119
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:02,260
effector is one of them is tarah dada it

120
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:06,820
will store all the applications that the

121
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:09,580
android phone phone has in it so if you

122
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,460
are possibly thinking about a man we're

123
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,370
being used to extract information from

124
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:19,239
this phone it is very important that we

125
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,280
search that directory so with an EDS we

126
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,070
can see all the applications installed

127
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,770
in the phone so here we can see a long

128
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:31,979
list of applications facebook photo

129
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:35,620
organized candy crush games

130
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:41,439
conversations a bit of everything and

131
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:44,080
then we may want to break down more or

132
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,140
less this information or not however out

133
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,860
of the sudden we found an application

134
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,990
which is come dot met exploit dot stage

135
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,910
where we all know what met exploit is

136
00:08:52,990 --> 00:09:00,880
and what metasploit can do as a forensic

137
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:03,850
analyst you start thinking to start

138
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,120
suspecting what could have happened so

139
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,580
we see that metal exploit application is

140
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,610
installed now let us see what this

141
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:17,830
application can do for that we go to

142
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:24,450
data a PP directory that's what we will

143
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:24,450
have the apks for that application

144
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:36,910
so we see all the apks application is

145
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,910
still didn't more by phone candy crush

146
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:55,939
however you may notice can you see so

147
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:58,010
meta exploit dot APK what is that well

148
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,769
through our previous experience tells us

149
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:03,589
that this is a malware and malware that

150
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:06,940
spies on the telephone how does it that

151
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:11,110
that by activating the webcam remotely

152
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:14,810
activating the phone remotely take

153
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,740
searching incoming and outcoming phones

154
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:21,560
we know that there is an eight thick hey

155
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,630
in malware application but this is not

156
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,250
good for our investigation we are

157
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:35,529
looking for the bad guy what do we do

158
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:40,810
for that therefore we do tool and we

159
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:45,920
send the application to a forensic lab

160
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:49,219
now in our computer we have the dots APK

161
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,160
but we do fast first of all we want to

162
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:54,949
attach a digital signature so that we

163
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,750
can track all the possible changes and

164
00:10:54,949 --> 00:11:02,439
modifications how do we do that very

165
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,440
easily for instance with a hash hsh one

166
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:38,079
so we will get a digital signature with

167
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:40,360
a hashtag SH multi-application so there

168
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,589
are number of characters see one abb

169
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:47,769
whatever this is a unique ID number to

170
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:51,670
be attached to that a PK from this

171
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:53,800
moment on if anyone makes any changes or

172
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,920
modifies the writing of that application

173
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,160
the hashtag will be different so

174
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:04,120
therefore the hash should be ridden on

175
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,430
our reports so that no one can change it

176
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,829
as of now still we don't know who did it

177
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,469
okay so we'll have to move on and what

178
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:13,750
do we do next now I really want to know

179
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,699
what our application does and who is

180
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:19,000
controlling that application well I will

181
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:21,339
assembly the code and this tells me but

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:29,709
this application does well I juice aplic

183
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:36,899
tool so which is a tool to the assemble

184
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:41,109
Android application d assembles the apk

185
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:47,790
and now we see what that application

186
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:47,790
actually does so we have manifest.xml

187
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:53,230
and what does application do well has

188
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,859
full access to the internet access to

189
00:12:53,230 --> 00:13:00,579
gps it allows you to sense and to

190
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:04,209
receive SMS messages to record audio and

191
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:07,510
video and more specifically activating

192
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:10,599
the webcam all the mobile phones have a

193
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,880
webcam front and a real one that camera

194
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,800
can be activated remotely we have to be

195
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,410
very careful with that it is complicated

196
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,750
to do so but it is not impossible we

197
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,839
should not overlook that information

198
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,600
still we don't know who did it okay we

199
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,589
continue to deep dive into the code of

200
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,589
the application

201
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:38,770
so this is everything that was in that

202
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:40,990
APK so we open payload and we get much

203
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:47,220
more information interesting information

204
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:50,230
now we have the IP VIP that malware is

205
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:53,110
used okay this has been changed it has

206
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:58,540
been modified well that would be the

207
00:13:53,110 --> 00:14:01,200
real IP of the actor so this is a very

208
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:04,780
interesting information for our

209
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,760
investigation we have in mud well we

210
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,990
have an application and we have a victim

211
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:13,530
what do we do now well now we just put

212
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,530
it on the record

213
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:38,779
alright sweet all this information that

214
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,790
we are generating we just write a police

215
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:43,189
report to the police report that we sent

216
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,670
out to the court so we have already sent

217
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:49,029
out the original reports to the judge

218
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:53,870
the judge is already aware of it and now

219
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:55,100
we also sent out all these data that we

220
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,569
are getting that is to say the

221
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,610
application that I think instructed from

222
00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:00,829
the mobile phone that has been digitally

223
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,100
signed we also sent it out to the judge

224
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:07,670
with a hash number as the hash number

225
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,970
has manual told us allow us to see is

226
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:21,649
that application has been changed to

227
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:25,309
later on or not furthermore we tell the

228
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:28,670
victim about the declaration made by the

229
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:35,689
former partner so we've seen that the

230
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:37,550
former partner is not involved in in

231
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:40,279
terms of the video we believe that she

232
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:43,790
did not disseminate the video we believe

233
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:47,420
that she did she's not harassing him but

234
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:51,410
still her declaration the position is

235
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,089
also sent out to the judge so we let the

236
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,639
judge know that we'll have analyzed

237
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,040
application but now we really want to

238
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:01,100
find out about the identity of the IP

239
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:06,469
address and what do we need for that

240
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:09,860
well we need order from the judge we

241
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:13,189
asked him to do that for us he asked us

242
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:17,569
to that the service provider the service

243
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:21,829
provider will tell us the identity of

244
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:25,610
the person behind the IP and we'd also

245
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:32,138
give us the address to address what that

246
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:32,139
IP is located so IP addresses

247
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:41,890
have because it's a personal disease the

248
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:46,390
personal information can only be

249
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:50,860
requested through a judge and that's a

250
00:16:46,390 --> 00:17:02,230
reason why we need a court order for

251
00:16:50,860 --> 00:17:05,770
that so then we'll help us then we will

252
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:10,020
know who is behind that IP address and

253
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:14,980
what should we do next well we can go

254
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:18,849
into the home of the person with that I

255
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,150
dress with that IP address any order

256
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:26,679
issued by a judge have to be

257
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:30,730
sufficiently motivated so in this case

258
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:33,640
because of the fact that we are that we

259
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,580
have and the evidence that we have is

260
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,490
not enough for us to get a search

261
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,939
warrant from the judge now the next step

262
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:46,110
is to get the ID of the person behind

263
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,630
the IP address so then we move on to our

264
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:53,649
conventional investigation and then we

265
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,750
investigate the address the domicile we

266
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:58,060
found out about how many members are

267
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:03,040
there in the household the age of them

268
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:06,340
and then we know that there is a elderly

269
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,070
couple living in that home and then

270
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:14,679
based on that information they are an

271
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:17,050
advanced age couple so actually this is

272
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,530
not good enough for the judge to give us

273
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,530
a search warrant

274
00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:32,139
what we will do next is to ask those

275
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:34,149
people to go to the police stations or

276
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:38,729
perhaps we will go to their home and

277
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:41,619
just to get declination from them

278
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:45,149
because I prior I we believe that they

279
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:48,699
are not they are not the actors of the

280
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:51,789
attack so we would just take the

281
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:56,259
creation from them and as my colleague

282
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:59,139
cell we asked the holder of the IP

283
00:18:56,259 --> 00:19:02,409
address to come to the police station so

284
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:04,869
that they give us more information or so

285
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:08,409
that we can see what is happening okay

286
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:09,939
and these deadly couple but they say

287
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:13,779
when they come to the police station

288
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:17,769
they say that they know nothing about IT

289
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:20,710
and the router was set up by their son

290
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:23,999
and then we called the Sun and we asked

291
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:28,059
them and we asked him to tell us how he

292
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:30,999
configured the router he just changed

293
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:33,269
the original IP address and then he gave

294
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:37,509
us another IP address and he also

295
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:40,059
installed mac filter so that only

296
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:45,129
authorized devices can be connected to

297
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:50,168
that router and he also Heidi he has

298
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:53,379
also hidden the name of the router so

299
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:55,210
this is an acceptable level of the

300
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:59,730
router but he didn't tell us anything

301
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:07,450
about the pin WS this is a system that

302
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:11,039
allowed us that allows us to connect

303
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:14,200
with the router without introducing any

304
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,869
password or anything very very simple

305
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,919
thing to do however what could be the

306
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:25,250
problem that we can get from the pin WPS

307
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:29,330
DC's an eight number

308
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:30,980
a sequence and that is divided in two

309
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:34,010
groups of four numbers how does

310
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,450
authentication mean work okay do out

311
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,879
etiquette yourself with the first four

312
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:42,890
numbers if you get them right it asks

313
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:45,350
you for the next four numbers so we have

314
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:49,940
an eight number password which is

315
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:54,730
divided in two passwords made up of four

316
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:58,550
numbers and then you can but not all the

317
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:03,350
WPS pins work in this fashion okay or

318
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:07,300
can be hacked in this way and as I say

319
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:11,270
do we can get we can get that pin number

320
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:14,800
so we have 11,000 chances to do so could

321
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:17,629
that be the way just by our by the

322
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,960
person who committed the attacks we just

323
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:26,480
don't know this is just a possibility

324
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:29,470
and this is what the person deposed and

325
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,650
then next time we ask them for

326
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:35,240
authorization to go to their home and

327
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:38,180
then we went to their home and we

328
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,250
checked out the router and then actually

329
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,610
we could prove that it was configured

330
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,920
ask his son sold us it was not a

331
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,679
standard configuration it had a higher

332
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:52,900
level of security now however we could

333
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:57,170
see that the pin WS number is active

334
00:21:52,900 --> 00:22:00,590
therefore we could see that it could

335
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:02,390
have been attacked in a given point in

336
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,669
time but is still with a know who is the

337
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,170
actor of that attacked and because we

338
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:10,220
couldn't get any more data from that

339
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:15,500
home we left however when we left we

340
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:18,800
could see that the light of the router

341
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,170
was flashing so this told us that that

342
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,480
was a device that was connected to it

343
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,840
that well then we went back to the

344
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,840
router

345
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:31,839
we took the local the configuration

346
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:36,019
panels and we could see a mac address

347
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:38,599
from a device that was just logged on

348
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:41,509
just connected to the router we asked

349
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,279
the people and we asked them whether

350
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:45,469
there was any other person in the home

351
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,629
and they told us know then we took a

352
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:49,759
look at the mac address and what does

353
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:52,820
the mac address tell us well the mac

354
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:57,139
address is made up of six group of

355
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:59,059
digits so the first digit tells us about

356
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:04,029
the model and the manufacturer of the

357
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:11,739
device then these told us that it was

358
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:15,109
tablets device an iPad more specifically

359
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:17,809
we asked the dwellers in the home

360
00:23:15,109 --> 00:23:22,059
whether they had an iPad in their home

361
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:26,889
and I said yes that they had this iPad

362
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:29,539
so they took it out of a drawer it was

363
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:38,208
broken and they said that I haven't used

364
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:42,139
it for many months and then that ipad is

365
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:47,329
broken and that ipad is connected to the

366
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:50,928
Wi-Fi router how could that happen but

367
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:54,229
the ipad is off is not issuing a nice i

368
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:58,459
know but is still the router is telling

369
00:23:54,229 --> 00:24:02,269
us that the that ipad is connected to

370
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:05,899
the Wi-Fi router so how can we locate

371
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:09,349
the person because we know that it is

372
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:11,809
not that ipad who that is connected to

373
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:17,149
the router so it's someone else using

374
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:20,359
that mac name so by intercepting the

375
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:23,178
flow of traffic of the device so that is

376
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:25,908
to say we just looked at the traffic

377
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:27,950
between the device and the access point

378
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:30,379
can we do that yes we can do it

379
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,719
technically but we kind of do that you

380
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:35,809
cannot do it legally because according

381
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:37,970
to article 18 of spanish constitution

382
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:40,100
secret of communication is a fun

383
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:47,380
mental right it means that can only be

384
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:55,040
reached through as such abhorrent and

385
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:58,670
then he and it is a last resource issued

386
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:06,159
by the judge therefore we find ourselves

387
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:13,160
in the situation where we cannot legally

388
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:18,320
intercept those communications so that

389
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:23,210
is a crime therefore what do we do well

390
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:25,610
we know that the evil person was

391
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:28,730
connected to the access points we could

392
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:31,550
even touch the person was perhaps less

393
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:36,040
than 50 meters away okay we're not the

394
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,040
person is there but where is that person

395
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:45,139
okay what solution do we use well we do

396
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:49,760
some imagination for that how can we

397
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:51,530
locate a person with a device who is

398
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,420
connected to an access points and we

399
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,420
know that we cannot intercept traffic

400
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,960
position

401
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,870
Malik estaba viendo que yo guitars in

402
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,880
the shin delete oh no all right so we

403
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:12,789
have seen that life okay we are not

404
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,890
scanning the Wi-Fi traffic so the only

405
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:17,740
thing that we can see here are all the

406
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,649
Wi-Fi devices that are either issuing or

407
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,770
receiving a signal of course we have

408
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:25,539
hidden okay the name of the Wi-Fi that

409
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:27,789
will be looking for well what do we have

410
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:32,020
here half interest will have a mac

411
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:34,029
address and then a powerful column so

412
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,279
this is the only thing that we have used

413
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:40,169
to locate the evil vessel we knew the

414
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:43,480
mac we know the mac address of the ipad

415
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:46,059
that was being spoofed okay this is one

416
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:51,299
of those maxing there so in the power

417
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:53,678
column we can calculate the power or the

418
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:56,408
strength that we are receiving from that

419
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,260
tablet at a very same point in time so

420
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:01,510
if these laptop is here and if it is

421
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:05,799
start to take a walk around the audience

422
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:10,960
I'm sure that some of the devices on the

423
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:14,440
screen will be more powerful in terms of

424
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,899
the sign up and others will be weaker so

425
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,330
this tells us whether we are closer or

426
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:20,918
further away it is like I don't know

427
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,199
like those games that we used to play

428
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:26,260
when we were a small again Seether am I

429
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,500
closer or further away from you okay and

430
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,649
because these utterly couple were living

431
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,630
in a detached home there were no sign of

432
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:37,658
rebound and they were living very close

433
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:39,760
to a park so we took our laptop okay and

434
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:41,860
we just left on Everett laptop what we

435
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,169
had on the screen so we decided to take

436
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,389
a walk around the park okay we could see

437
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:48,970
the mac address that was going up and

438
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:51,580
down the screen okay we came close to

439
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:55,960
children playing okay d strength of the

440
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:59,830
sino was reduced etc and we were kind of

441
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,649
just giving up we could see a young boy

442
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:05,110
with a laptop sitting on the bench we

443
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:08,559
came close to him okay the closer we got

444
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:11,439
to him the signup became

445
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:15,370
more and more powerful the closer we'll

446
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:19,539
work from him we could see that he had a

447
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:21,850
mentor brother console and then he saw

448
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:25,629
us and suddenly he closed down his

449
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:35,980
computer he closed down the computer and

450
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:41,110
designer went off then we identified

451
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:42,999
ourselves as police policemen we asked

452
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:49,090
him what he was doing he got really

453
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:51,999
anxious and what did we do well we know

454
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:57,428
that he is the actor that he committed

455
00:29:51,999 --> 00:30:00,279
the attack so we did not arrest him no

456
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:03,940
we did not well because we don't have

457
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:08,309
enough evidence to arrest him however we

458
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:12,549
have enough evidence to intervene the

459
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:18,629
equipment we identified ourselves we

460
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:23,139
took the keys computer away from him and

461
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:27,789
then we just wrote down every port so we

462
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:32,168
included the serial number we

463
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:37,779
confiscated his computer but we did not

464
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:42,309
address the person so we checked his

465
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:45,190
domicile we just included his personal

466
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:49,389
details in our reports have report that

467
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:54,409
we sent out to the judge

468
00:30:49,389 --> 00:31:02,120
and now the judge has this information

469
00:30:54,409 --> 00:31:06,289
as well as the laptop so we will ask the

470
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:08,658
judge to give us an order to analyze the

471
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:12,499
laptop because the person did not

472
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:14,360
authorize us to search his computer we

473
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:18,200
need to get authorization from the judge

474
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:21,559
and then once we had that order we

475
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,049
analyzed the contents of the pc well to

476
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,389
analyze the content of a laptop is not a

477
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:29,869
question of switching it on and start

478
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:33,379
playing around and see what's in it so

479
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:43,418
we start off from a laptop which is just

480
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:51,498
him i confiscated so we go to the court

481
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:56,269
and before and then we take out the hard

482
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:59,809
drive and then we take a forensic image

483
00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:02,990
of the laptop okay we never work with

484
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:04,850
the original hardware we always make a

485
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:09,139
copy because we want to ensure that

486
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:11,928
evidence will never be lost so as I said

487
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:14,928
we do the forensic analysis and then we

488
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:17,470
calculate it a hash again all the

489
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:20,779
evidence that we obtain are always

490
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:23,570
linked to a hash a hash that would allow

491
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:25,610
us to see whether they will further

492
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:30,110
changes will be made to it or not when

493
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:34,399
we finished our forensic image we give

494
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:36,408
the computer back to deepen your add the

495
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:39,709
court and then we take the copy of the

496
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:43,100
hard work to our lab to analyze it as I

497
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:46,100
say we take the copy and we analyze the

498
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,889
hard drive or the hard drive of the

499
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:52,090
laptop that will have confiscated so

500
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:52,090
let's see what we find

501
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:15,090
so we will be using an open source tool

502
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:18,460
known as dff months an image a system

503
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:20,439
okay there are very many tools such as

504
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,540
this one okay this is the one that I

505
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,090
like the most but any other could also

506
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:27,790
be used so what do we want logical

507
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:31,770
device well we want to forensic image

508
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,770
okay so we go for logical file

509
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:50,220
right we'll have image dot DT which is a

510
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:54,779
forensic image of the hard drive so

511
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:59,239
imagine that that corresponds to the

512
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:59,239
hard drive of the actor of the attack

513
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:23,899
and we mounted the image just to take a

514
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:28,590
look at all the files directories etc

515
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:30,719
and this is what we used for our work as

516
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:35,100
I said yes we could see that it was

517
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:37,109
linux and we know that linux was

518
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,230
installed in that computer we know that

519
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:43,710
from the structure of the files so

520
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:46,649
because window doesn't have any ATC file

521
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:52,230
or whatever design Linux directories and

522
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:56,009
now we know that linux was induced so

523
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,780
what directory would you go first if you

524
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,300
were to find that I would go to root

525
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,619
okay that's where all the information is

526
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:06,270
I'm sure there will be something

527
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:10,440
interested and the root in red we have

528
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:12,360
the files that had been eliminated so we

529
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,940
really want to see what was being done

530
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,940
in that computer when we confiscated it

531
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:32,160
so here we have some fights starting off

532
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:36,840
with dots so we can see them all now so

533
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:39,990
well that that's basis tree all the

534
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,990
commands executed in the command console

535
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:47,759
will be stored in a file that is stored

536
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:49,830
and the root so there you will find all

537
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,570
the comments that i have used in linux

538
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:59,850
so what do we find fast erina airplay

539
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:03,750
and then a mac address you know what

540
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:07,609
this map which mac address was that well

541
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:12,300
was exactly the same mac address of the

542
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:15,540
ipad of the elderly couple so this is

543
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:19,320
the evidence that the user of the laptop

544
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:24,350
had hacked the Wi-Fi network of the

545
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,350
elderly couple we continue searching

546
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:36,880
oh can you tell me what that is who can

547
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:41,950
tell me what that is that is malicious

548
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:45,610
help malicious software for the

549
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:51,129
malicious up that's another piece of

550
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:56,950
evidence this tells us how the APK was

551
00:36:51,130 --> 00:37:01,240
built and this is the ports of the

552
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:05,379
mobile phone that had the malwa we have

553
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,810
just close to do look so we have the

554
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,750
laptop where that malware was created

555
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:13,420
okay two pieces of evidence so we

556
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:25,900
continue searching see what else we get

557
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:31,570
a messy for what is that well this is

558
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:35,830
the metasploit directory well that is a

559
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:39,430
pen testing and exploiting program and

560
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:45,940
then we have another history okay very

561
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:49,960
good let us look at it these are all the

562
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:52,690
comments introducing metasploit then we

563
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,120
also had roldy comments introducing

564
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:58,600
linux and now we have the commands of

565
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:03,180
metasploit so we have rivers disappear

566
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:08,529
from my proj a android to an IP address

567
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:14,160
okay this local IP address okay we

568
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:19,360
continue there is a for brand news

569
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:23,220
there's a log in there oh let's double

570
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,220
check from word log

571
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:30,980
fourth testing we got testing that

572
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:32,780
proves that this person has a check out

573
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:35,140
the website in our computer and our

574
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:38,180
mobile phone which was a spy on them

575
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:44,810
remotely they took out the webcam from

576
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:46,520
these mobile phone for tests so we only

577
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:49,670
have the previous information the more

578
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:53,380
powerful the more can be you or myself I

579
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,380
got more information from then on

580
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:18,730
10 so far so good so we have proved that

581
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:21,819
from this the equipment an expert was

582
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:25,240
created or an application that was

583
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:26,740
introduced in a smartphone from which we

584
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,899
have been able to extract information

585
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:32,709
and we have also to churn me in that

586
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,079
inside its squidman we had bound arrayed

587
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:37,599
a Wi-Fi network and we have been

588
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:41,290
connected on the Rooter through which we

589
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,660
get out of with this IP address so now

590
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:46,900
we can determine this person has bound

591
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:50,230
this criminal facts so let's proceed to

592
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:52,960
arrest this person and we can charge

593
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:55,599
them with the the crime of revealing

594
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,710
secrets for having obtained this video

595
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:02,950
file and later on the crime returns

596
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:06,220
referred to the connection on the Wi-Fi

597
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:10,210
network with this people and information

598
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:12,790
of electrical flow and fluid and it

599
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:15,309
crime of extortion based upon asking

600
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:19,869
money in exchange of not publishing this

601
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:23,619
information so we want to reach the very

602
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:27,880
end of this question so we our question

603
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:31,720
is are we are this person doing this for

604
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:34,540
getting a 10,000 coins bitcoins so

605
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,759
pushing out the thread we discovered

606
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,180
that the arrested person was the current

607
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,819
partner did the current partner from the

608
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:47,020
previous former partner of the reporter

609
00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:50,558
so this person there was an anonymous

610
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:53,589
person there wasn't a motive behind them

611
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:58,599
because this person noticed the videos

612
00:40:53,589 --> 00:41:00,910
on his previous of partnered so they

613
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:03,819
want to check out the question jealousy

614
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:05,649
jealous is the reason so this person

615
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:10,509
messed around with everything because of

616
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:15,220
jealous so I want to give you some

617
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:17,650
remarks and some advice for super users

618
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,839
to secure eyes your web Wi-Fi networks

619
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:23,640
the basic

620
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:27,570
advise the body for wpa password can be

621
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:32,250
calculated in many ways if you transfer

622
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:35,790
it and change them why PF password is

623
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:38,070
better so that chance their role

624
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:40,890
administration the router has to be a

625
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:44,630
chance as well so again changed office

626
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:48,960
out so it is better for you to get in

627
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:52,440
WPS activated only if it's not in use if

628
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,360
not don't activated so this is absurd

629
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,460
for you to do have it activate if you

630
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,310
feel users is comfortable it is the gun

631
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,310
is working properly simply don't

632
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:04,350
activate the video if you don't use it

633
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:07,080
activate it only in use another piece of

634
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:09,120
advice which is just one because it

635
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,850
won't give you extra information and

636
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:15,029
security but this hide and conceal the

637
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:18,509
name of the Wi-Fi network and filter out

638
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:22,230
through Mac you can really help the more

639
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:27,660
trouble out filtering out in on mag that

640
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:30,570
especially on Wi-Fi in public things

641
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,390
that don't use public why fans to get

642
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:36,180
into the banking and networkers somebody

643
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:39,210
is especially getting in my wife you can

644
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,950
use applications fee NAT ethercat we can

645
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:43,920
check out all the mechanisms devices

646
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:45,720
guys on our Wi-Fi so we can see things

647
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:51,000
and we can be suspicious about people

648
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:53,370
around us so crack an elÿon Wi-Fi

649
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,290
networks I'm getting into some others

650
00:42:53,370 --> 00:43:01,650
people wife up I'm committing a crime or

651
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:04,590
fraud in and one or two cyber

652
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:07,830
communications if it's a hot ampang

653
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:10,650
mounted to crack me on and to spy on

654
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:12,810
what I'm doing first perhaps the cracker

655
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,360
has been in a hacker as well another

656
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:17,100
piece of device of European attention to

657
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,730
the fact that when I scan the Wi-Fi

00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:22,959
dicks and when you do the back up on

677
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:25,540
your hard dicks and you what permissions

678
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,250
did you get to make it effective in

679
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,360
order not to delay the information

680
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:35,470
running through it when in store there

681
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:38,800
are you do refer for the ideas SSD legs

682
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:44,730
and the hard drive and normal the digs

683
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:48,040
to know the the cast studentship chain

684
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:51,700
some part of the machine is installing

685
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:54,670
only reader mo I cannot write

686
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:58,740
anything so there are forensic machines

687
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,740
prepared exclusively to this perp

688
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:09,020
tix against writing to modify my

689
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:11,390
evidence this is a festival the colonial

690
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:14,450
forensic devices don't analyze the

691
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:16,400
content they copy the bits from the

692
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:18,649
first one to the end there they don't

693
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,020
care about information formerly some

694
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:24,800
people were telling me that this isn't

695
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:28,310
oneness this was not really true it was

696
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:32,330

the dark given up by the day long from

707
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,690
scripts they have this special security

708
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:22,490
ceiling to avoid manipulating the

709
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:24,710
content which is a possible likely

710
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,930
manipulation and the computer is taking

711
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,570
inner out elements from there if these

712
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:32,390
bags are still and you kind of plug in

713

749
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:38,740
I have a question for you please please

750
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:42,879
I can't hear it properly the back of the

751
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:46,540
room the custodianship shame black are

752
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,480
common plastic box the default I bags

753
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:52,870
are for the mobile devices smartphones

754
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:56,920
connected on the networks to avoid that

755
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:59,380
a mobile device connected on the network

756
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:04,750
modifies its contents we use for the eye

757
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:06,400
bags for that for computers it could

758
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:09,040
happen be in the farther back because it

759
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,590
is turned off the computer is not going

760
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:15,420
to interfere with this data without

761
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:20,200
mechanisms I got it I thought about it

762
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:24,580
as you mentioned with the mobile phone

763
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:27,250
and Android first and a common plastic

764
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:28,509
bag was used but if you don't take

765
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,860
necessary precautions with this plastic

766
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:36,100
bag after being with a custom shape of

767
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:39,310
the decor something's can be a liked out

768
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:41,290
do you mean that the smartphones but you

769
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,759
need to take further precautions with

770
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:45,850
more phones because when you're

771
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:50,140
connecting on the mobile phone network

772
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:52,480
you get missed of course and other

773
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,670
messages that modify the content it's on

774
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,640
the same to be confiscating them all for

775
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,560
instance and also confiscate in a lab

776
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:03,460
and you need a techna take necessary

777
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:08,259
grantees and measures in order to get

778
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:12,100
that the test that is correct at court

779
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:14,410
not nothing cannot be modified or tamper

780
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:16,270
with manipulated you into the itinerary

781
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:20,370
from there the crime stay in to the

782
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,370
court we aren't it thank you

783
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:36,060
sorry we cannot hear the speaker because

784
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:37,740
he's not using the microphone as you do

785
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,200
with the forensic analysis with a

786
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:44,100
suspicious computer do you use the

787
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:48,450
analysis on the Rooter from the eldery

788
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:50,460
to keep on with the locks the

789
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:53,910
communication the elderly people do with

790
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:59,250
a told Reuters in this case we set up

791
00:50:53,910 --> 00:51:01,920
and write down some official report done

792
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:05,430
by the officers where they relate what

793
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,350
they have done they take photographic

794
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:11,790
report we avoid manipulate you

795
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:13,440
manipulating the richer because as you

796
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:15,360
know Reuters depend on them the

797
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,940
manufacturing more that they can be

798
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,310
installed in different ways but an image

799
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:22,890
and photographic report is a such period

800
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:25,890
it gives some absolutely notice of what

801
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:30,710
is saying on the computer screen which

802
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:30,710
refer n shade all data get from that

803
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:41,470
if I pee comes from a country which is

804
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:45,970
on Spain is a lost case you know there

805
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:49,240
are there exist ways of policial the

806
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:51,939
police judicial Interpol good ways of

807
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,529
collaboration is not a lost case by the

808
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:57,510
way that the procedure takes longer

809
00:51:53,530 --> 00:52:03,540
because isn't it is the same doing

810
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:05,860
search tax in Spain zombies on as doing

811
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:08,050
requests from other countries to conduct

812
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:11,170
this search in a different country for

813
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:14,200
instance if it's China this for the sake

814
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:15,520
of it if it's China or Russia or there

815
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,529
are some other cancers collaborating

816
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,840
less with a US but I'm there may be

817
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:27,550
other cancers collaborating more open

818
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:31,060
and which way hello absolutely up there

819
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:32,560
up there by the way by the way before

820
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,810
moving to the next question regarding

821
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,779
the last two theme it's true it's not

822
