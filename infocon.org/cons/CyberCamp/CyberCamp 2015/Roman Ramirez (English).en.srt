1
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:07,798
okay give me a sec the thing is that I

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,170
updated my presentation and I talked to

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,290
David he told me about the content of

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,079
his presentation and actually I wanted

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,880
to talk about OPSEC both for

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,759
professionals and for families then I

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,640
had to reorient it to change it okay so

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,260
that it wouldn't overlap with Debbie's

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,410
presentation then that's the reason why

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:33,059
all right so give me a sec as I say all

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:37,290
right here we go good thank you very

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:39,930
much for coming here on a Sunday morning

13
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,969
it has been cut for all of us to be here

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,690
congratulations to the festa speaker

15
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:53,180
this morning who just talked at the

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:56,519
worst time of the day so this is the

17
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:04,250
index of a continent of my presentation

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:07,710
so as that it's said before in your life

19
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,229
in your life there is information of all

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,229
kinds everything is connected and when I

21
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,908
say connected I don't mean that your

22
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:20,039
phones and your computers are connected

23
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:24,150
but your life is connected to everyone

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,420
around you as David said a metadata may

25
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,189
lead to the arrest of a person is very

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,110
important because at the end of the day

27
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,610
even if you don't want to be visible on

28
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,799
the internet if you don't want your

29
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,350
personal details to be available on the

30
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,259
internet through your people okay

31
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,929
through your friends your personal

32
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,689
details may be available on the Internet

33
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,299
I let me recommend this book to you this

34
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,689
is about establishing correlation rules

35
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:55,470
of data that may look a prior a little

36
00:01:51,689 --> 00:02:01,029
structure this actually takes place okay

37
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:03,220
and this is this leads to things the

38
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,770
such as the things that was done by this

39
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:09,220
person and conclusion sometimes a

40
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:15,130
terrifying I highly recommend that you

41
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:19,410
read that work and this man has yes

42
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:21,519
uploaded snapshots through onto flickr

43
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,370
so it may think that there are people

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,330
who are not working or connected at all

45
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,640
so security specialist work with very

46
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,220
many specific tools however all these

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,208
have been programmed by people with few

48
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:40,060
scripts with metadata rigueur publicly

49
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:43,780
available and visible on the internet so

50
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,660
this is an example of what an individual

51
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,569
can do as long as that individual have

52
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,359
some time and let me highlight the some

53
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,160
time that is also needed to do that and

54
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,650
let me remind you what will happen with

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,450
when we we will have with us the

56
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:04,300
Internet's of the things we are talking

57
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:07,149
about 42,000 million thousand million

58
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:10,780
devices connected now I did point in

59
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,590
time we have 40 point five thousand

60
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,810
million devices well in the future there

61
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,450
will be sensors on your chair telling

62
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,250
you how much you wait how much you are

63
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,649
sweating and there will be a central

64
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,070
sent seven key are detecting whether

65
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,130
someone is via hiv-positive whether

66
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:32,260
someone is nervous anxious so think

67
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,450
about that this is what is coming in the

68
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,250
future through the internet of the

69
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,980
things everything around you is

70
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:42,130
connected so the sensor that are having

71
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,440
my hands because of my heartbeat my

72
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,440
heart rate and because of the sweat in

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:51,010
my hand will disclose information as to

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:55,390
my rate of anxiety and of course these

75
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:57,820
not to mention the spy that we all carry

76
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:02,440
in our pocket which is our mobile phone

77
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:06,340
and then same as with thee what we heard

78
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,799
from bitcoin bitcoin which is an animus

79
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,700
coin that may bypass any government

80
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,040
controls ok we should think of

81
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,530
that we should also think about it smart

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,219
grids we all think that is Margaret will

83
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,250
help us be more energy efficient that we

84
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,280
will be that we will end up paying a

85
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:30,620
lower bill because we will be getting or

86
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:33,080
using cheap electricity but imagine that

87
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,479
this could be a way of giving

88
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,070
information about ourselves okay imagine

89
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:43,130
that I am a single person etc and then

90
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:47,000
he Saturday night there is a pic of

91
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,280
energy okay so sunday morning okay there

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,639
is another pic of electricity okay main

93
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,130
one someone may easily think okay that I

94
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,710
just had was very successful at night

95
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,960
last night with a girl and then well I

96
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,479
slept with her and then the next day she

97
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,960
took a shower at my home alright and

98
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,150
Tesla I have to give them credit okay

99
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,969
they have just being a revolutionary a

100
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,460
revolution in the automotive industry

101
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,100
okay we should not forget that casa for

102
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,900
also part of the model of our society we

103
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,690
changed thought you would end up

104
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,359
changing society so a car that is

105
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,700
connected to the internet that is fitted

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,580
with all kinds of sensors it will be a

107
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,219
breakthrough well what happened between

108
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,320
Tesla and Jeep was very very interesting

109
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,840
you remember that some researchers found

110
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,909
two bong Revilla DS for both these cars

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,159
where they could have stopped the brakes

112
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,760
the difference between Tesla did Tesla

113
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,280
they just disclosed a part and then the

114
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:49,580
car stopped Greenville level in four

115
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,909
days whereas Jeep is still trying to

116
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:56,870
recall all the costs that are being

117
00:05:52,910 --> 00:06:00,380
impacted so this is very very dangerous

118
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,320
again we are seeing someone with the

119
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,710
capacity to stop your car as you are

120
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:09,340
driving it on the motorway and now this

121
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:13,539
is one the images that gave me lots of

122
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:19,330
food for thought okay so cause car crash

123
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:22,900
you know buildings no police cars fire

124
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,198
fighters this may look like naive okay

125
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,859
like innocence imagine that we moved

126
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:33,490
seven years ahead in time okay imagines

127
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,919
that all everyone has its devices

128
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,440
connected okay this red points stand for

129
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,310
sensors sensors could do the following

130
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,620
everyone around half mobile phones them

131
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,870
and microphones and microphones recorded

132
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,290
the noise of the impact then they just

133
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,720
protested it to a big data database

134
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:55,120
tendulkar just not reported to your

135
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,910
insurance that you were over in speeding

136
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,620
then all those data were given to the

137
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:05,410
police in the neighborhood so be aware

138
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:09,820
of the implications of it before you

139
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:14,580
write the reports you know who is it to

140
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:17,889
blame who made who was over speeding

141
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,200
what speed the person was driving they

142
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,479
even the floor the motorway will have

143
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,349
sensors I'm going to be connected a

144
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:29,860
priori that information may be noise to

145
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:33,280
you however the specialist the mining of

146
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,220
gathering noise to know who you are how

147
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,739
you will behave what are you interested

148
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,780
in buying whether you are an activist

149
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,320
whether you are a terrorist on whether

150
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,659
you are a good person and now you are

151
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,080
wearing your feet dates and you are

152
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:53,320
giving health information to a person

153
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,990
that you don't know who this person is

154
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,719
or where this person is and perhaps this

155
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,090
person is sending out information to a

156
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,010
health insurance company and you are

157
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,650
giving him your data about your

158
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:09,820
heartbeat and your health status and

159
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:13,479
perhaps tomorrow you want to subscribe

160
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,430
an insurance and they may not and the

161
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,659
right that insurance for you because you

162
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,420
are

163
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:22,590
to unhealthy for them you are running

164
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:26,490
with brand keeper are you crazy how on

165
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,979
earth do you upload your data on the

166
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,900
Internet okay do you want to go running

167
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,960
and do you want someone waiting for you

doing good things or bad things ok the

198
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:18,290
only the one and only objective of

199
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,470
companies in in the world is making

200
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,599
money making business I would write all

201
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,310
those companies many of them are

202
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,290
internet company are gathering

203
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,229
information about yourself and I using

204
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:35,510
that information for whatever reason

205
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:38,149
that we are not aware of ok these so

206
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,800
sometimes this company lobby and put

207
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:42,220
pressure on other companies and

208
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,969
organizations just to include within

209
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:50,779
police umbrella security experts I never

210
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:55,100
get tired of denouncing or saying that

211
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:57,470
the private security law is hassle lobby

212
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,690
behind this is a message for do

213
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,270
professional if you don't do anything

214
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:06,260
against it tomorrow you will be working

215
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:09,680
under the command of the police forces

216
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,050
ok so please do not waste your time and

217
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,949
because they will continue to make money

218
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,599
and then to enhance the loving actions

219
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:19,100
they are doing and I'm sure that many of

220
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,860
you are getting but I'm saying right

221
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,529
away these are the Mafia these are the

222
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,050
evil was the Russians the Brazilian the

223
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:30,320
koreas the Chinese does room Eastern

224
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:32,510
Europe does in Spain mafia have only one

225
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,740
objective in life you know making money

226
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:39,560
as well as companies but in

227
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,709
manner because they are out of the law

228
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:46,010
they can only be purses or sought after

229
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:48,349
by the law enforcement agencies they

230
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,380
make money out of selling your clinical

231
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:55,640
history to insurance company then the

232
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:59,149
money that they get from fraud in tragic

233
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:02,810
cards they get it used for organized

234
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:06,350
crime from drug dealing so if my

235
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:09,290
computer is vulnerable then this made

236
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,690
results in having a person kidnapped in

237
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:16,939
one country and salted to another

238
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:18,950
country to to abuse her okay mafia is

239
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,890
there and do have to be responsible

240
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:24,230
you'll have to take responsibility for

241
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,270
your security whether you are security

242
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,000
experts all whether you have private

243
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,449
individuals families and now I have a

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,339
sweet and sour relationship with

245
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:36,250
intelligence agencies I understand the

246
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,080
function understand what they do

247
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:43,070
understand that they are there or should

248
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:46,459
be there because they have to enforce

249
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:50,510
the Constitution however we should

250
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:53,630
control access excesses okay too much

251
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:58,130
control access control at the end of the

252
00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:01,820
day may lead to situations where we

253
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:06,350
cannot even trust and angry birds and

254
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:10,310
they say is behind and angry birds they

255
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:13,240
were intelligence agencies getting

256
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:16,339
information about the users of

257
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,370
application such as angry bed angry

258
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:23,510
birds and this is also fruitful search

259
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:25,940
no one should cheat you with the fear

260
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,430
doctrine I don't know if you know what

261
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,010
happening Paris you know they were

262
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,339
saying all the time they were bombarding

263
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:37,040
us with information that all the

264
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:39,140
messages were encrypted and cryptid

265
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,230
encrypted and actually no they were just

266
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:44,529
sending out like clear messages that

267
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:48,100
were communicating each other with what

268
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:51,009
if you are the you are security expert

269
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,999
if you don't stop the Tyrannosaur of

270
00:13:51,009 --> 00:14:00,310
seven elf security we will end up with

271
00:13:54,999 --> 00:14:03,069
no freedom with no security so be aware

272
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:07,359
of whatever is being said and your name

273
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:10,599
and I'm criticized for defending the law

274
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,350
and enforcement agencies and what they

275
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:18,129
do okay but I do so however that should

276
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:21,399
be controlled by the citizenship okay so

277
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:24,999
these are very very important actors

278
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,249
that are there in the acceleration in

279
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:29,790
the left i believe the new enforcement

280
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:32,800
agencies should only be the ones

281
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:36,790
enforcing first and enforcing the

282
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,729
competences in society okay because we

283
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:43,660
give them we give them the competence to

284
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:48,939
do so if they overdo it if they overdo

285
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:51,639
it in the well we will have to report it

286
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:54,009
but they have the power to defendants

287
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:57,040
because if we all want to defend

288
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:59,620
ourselves individually at the end of the

289
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,160
day the strongest will win which is to

290
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:06,100
say the Mafia and the industry careful

291
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,050
careful with anonymous and this type of

292
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:12,250
groups that they say that they are

293
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,319
attacking Isis etc well this is the same

294
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:18,579
as expecting everyone to carry weapons

295
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:22,199
and then to take justice in their hands

296
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:24,819
all right so other actors out there

297
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:30,599
activists and fascinated with what

298
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:30,599
happens in the last year's well

299
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:41,620
so P anoj has been disclosed okay

300
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:44,080
recently has been debated so much now

301
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:48,850
everyone talks about it I can remember a

302
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:52,390
chillin he well everyone where it was we

303
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,850
were clear that it's bo nash what

304
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:58,090
they're okay but now everyone knows that

305
00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:00,520
this is real that that is happening we

306
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:06,610
have all kinds of activists and everyone

307
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:10,300
knows that right so that icon of the

308
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:13,090
globe and actually well they're wearing

309
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,670
the mask of a Catholic terrorists and

310
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,550
nany most at the end of the day has

311
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:21,189
brought an idea to the world I disagree

312
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,620
with the procedures that they follow but

313
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:26,230
US citizens have something to do in that

314
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,500
regard so that the world where you live

315
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:32,560
is that is not as bad as it looks it

316
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,260
will be then other actors security

317
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,599
events specialized groups these are some

318
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,780
of the events that are done in Spain I

319
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,560
am one of the organizers of rooted using

320
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:47,380
their we opened up below and then other

321
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,319
people also organize events they are

322
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,810
committed with bringing transferring

323
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,510
security to everyone social security

324
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,089
should not be enclosed everyone should

325
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,020
understand security as long as we

326
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:05,610
continue to think that security can be

327
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:08,829
acing the hands of hackers and and I

328
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:10,839
claim myself to be a hacker even if

329
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,839
someone someone doesn't like me to say

330
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,720
that I'm a haka so security should not

331
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,448
be enclosed okay if you want to bring it

332
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,560
out to society and to citizenship okay

333
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:26,550
we have to make that possible we have to

334
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:30,639
rethink Andrea proach your discourse and

335
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:35,350
careful careful the bear

336
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:39,730
is ok on telegram it's your

337
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:42,550
responsibility to become part of that

338
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:47,230
group or nuts okay I think kind of asked

339
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:50,409
to include these slide okay discussions

340
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:53,950
are out of control and are not censored

341
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,690
whatsoever I argue or discuss with many

342
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,610
of them because we have opposing views

343
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,830
but it is very important that you

344
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,490
understand that everyone has to be in

345
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:05,949
this security ecosystem I refer to it as

346
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,780
security community okay but well it is

347
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:12,700
there just in case you want to do it

348
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:14,830
have you seen the serious mr. rubble so

349
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,910
what's the problem with these serious

350
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:22,480
with mr. rubble i very much dislike

351
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:27,610
stereotypes so this serious talks about

352
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,110
or shows a haka he said we at man ok so

353
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,520
I'm wearing a shirt at the novel at the

354
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,760
rest of the hackers in the world where I

355
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,940
sheds or just hoodie jackets and then

356
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,600
again you know stereotype he's kind of a

357
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:46,390
nerd all the time behind his computer

358
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:51,510
and strange and a freak okay I hate the

359
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:56,200
stereotypes and all of you present here

360
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:58,150
are in the security dash a community

361
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,470
dash ecosystem because you are all

362
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:05,530
involved in security everything that

363
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,540
someone does against or in favor

364
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,030
security will have an impact in your

365
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,300
life if you stand still if you do

366
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:17,290
nothing the world the world will get

367
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:19,840
worse and as I say mafia and companies

368
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,750
with back practices are interested in

369
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,629
taking advantage of you notice that that

370
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,700
finger pointing at you okay reflects

371
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:32,710
about what you do on the better day so

372
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:34,870
to improve to improve security in the

373
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,120
world well I've been thinking about an

374
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,760
experiment for quite some time now which

375
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,560
is about a platform to do

376
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,700
wondering so that the other a hard was

377
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:50,470
just to register 300,000 Bitcoin

378
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:53,620
addresses and then okay and then if I

379
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,740
managed you know to launder your money I

380
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:00,459
get fifty percent margin or Commission

381
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:04,030
well bitcoin is one of the worst threats

382
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:06,100
for the status Q status school model

383
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:11,280
that will have today if you do see is

384
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:16,449
rightly these currency is not traceable

385
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,879
so there are atms ATMs of for bitcoins

386
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:22,000
there is one here in central Madrid

387
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,790
there is no way to trace who is behind

388
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,370
these transactions there is not even

389
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:30,879
time for the people at the Treasury to

390
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:33,159
research on any micro transaction think

391
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,920
about that think about what will happen

392
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:38,290
with no one can control where you can

393
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,000
spend your money I very much like the

394
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,540
idea of Bitcoin because it will give

395
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,920
back privacy to some citizens it will

396
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:50,260
also open the door to mafias but the

397
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,930
Carter magnetic institutions are there

398
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,810
everyone has the right to privacy even

399
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,880
in when it comes to economic

400
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,700
transactions and what is the main

401
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,760
problem the main problem is profiling I

402
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,550
had a discussion with a person who works

403
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,950
in marketing he was telling me that he

404
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:11,790
wanted to look for a specific target

405
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:14,170
with a specific set and we see

406
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,850
purchasing habits and I said well you

407
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,070
are not living in the same world than me

408
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,929
okay that is absolutely not talking

409
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,850
about the marketing for a demographic

410
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:24,880
group you are talking about a person who

411
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:27,189
knows perfectly over who I am so it is

412
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,820
not every man is between 40 and 50 years

413
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,950
of each one of the most handsome men in

414
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,439
Spain no they say rome and a mere human

415
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,330
it leaves in this street because I know

416
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,400
what the street where he lives I know

417
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,159
how much rent or mortgage he is paying

418
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,680
and because i know that i multiply that

419
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,990
Brown third which is the expenses that

420
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,440
we all have therefore I know how much

421
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,200
money Roman makes

422
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,930
at work and then he posted you know

423
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,510
photographs with naked girls okay they

424
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,810
know that I am a heterosexual and

425
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:05,270
because they post my comments okay and

426
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:07,730
they note that I am and left-wing person

427
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,710
okay they know my political party dress

428
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,680
apart we are not talking about at

429
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:16,600
apologies we are talking about perfectly

430
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:20,270
in identified individuals and this is

431
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,879
this does not currently have an impact

432
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,879
on professionals working on OPSEC that

433
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,620
we are talking about your children

434
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,980
yourselves okay and that has lots and

435
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,590
lots of communications okay DC's slide

436
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,360
that I with using all my presentation

437
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:38,510
this is highly highly interesting this

438
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,449
is a World Economic Forum researching on

439
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:43,790
the top ten Fred's for Humanity and when

440
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,610
I say humanity i mean the human race I

441
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:48,760
don't know what you can read it but well

442
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:52,750
we have cyber attacks can you read that

443
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:56,020
cyber attacks have been put on top of

444
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:59,870
asset bubbles social instability

445
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:03,139
terrorist attacks can you see what cyber

446
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:07,610
attacks are placed so nowadays the

447
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:10,250
concern about cyber attacks it's making

448
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:12,919
everyone revolving and taking action

449
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:16,280
around that because a person with

450
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:19,010
technology can do serious harm anyone

451
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:22,790
who's got a computer has a very powerful

452
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:25,550
weapon in his hand okay so notice this

453
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,830
is light again so it is means that the

454
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:30,769
report that will be discussed easy

455
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:33,949
we'll just place cyber attacks above

456
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:36,500
water scarcity so that is considered to

457
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:39,769
be one of the worst possible threats for

458
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:43,429
humanity not forget that also very

459
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:46,490
important in terms of the tracking so

460
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:48,559
did it say out of curiosity and log into

461
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,750
the website of an insurance company and

462
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,740
with because when they wanted to

463
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:56,690
estimate the value of you know they

464
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,820
started to ask me questions are you

465
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,620

they are just tracking you they are

470
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:17,090
profiling me about the type of person

471
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:19,580
that I am how much risk that I take what

472
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,279
I don't take okay so own initials

473
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,408

these pictures are tacit and labeled

481
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,460
with the latitude and longitude around

482
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:49,130
as there are 17 and a word cat lovers

483
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,710
who have loaded their cards pictures

484
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:53,840
totally he located people unaware that

485
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,399
they are giving away so much information

486
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,129
you can find these kind of pictures

487
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:01,699
reflecting that molly love okay you

488
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:04,399
think a mother fathered and stop to

489
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,070
thane before uploading this picture on

490
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:10,729
the Internet let's reflect on that let's

491
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:13,549
Mull this over there's an other path

492
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,740
than making human beings not only

493
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:17,418
hackers and technicians human beings

494
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,549
have to be responsible for their own

495
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:22,159
security and cyber security let's just

496
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:24,470
stop people uploading this picture on

497
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,649
the internet without knowing words doing

498
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:30,529

00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,928
the traffic in our lives to keep track

for life Oh a lesson learn what they can

538
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:32,450
do it another it is structural article

539
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:34,909
they experience when we get into some

540
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,610
stores with an afro as computer they

541
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:39,950
restructure their all first and offered

542
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,539
the high expense of it because they took

543
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:44,139
for granted that somebody having an

544
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:48,480
apple happy biggest purchase power

545
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:51,270
compared so Apple consumers an expander

546
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,740
is left really options for everybody I

547
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,330
have their opinions vary but I have my

548
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:58,130
own opinion about this you've got

549
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:01,199
structures offers through a window

550
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:03,210
machine are distractor compared to those

551
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,460
when you are getting into an apple teen

552
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,549

the week kids and the secretary is you

554

of you be responsible for young cyber

563
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:39,210
security this is the richest level

564
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:43,590
getting getting brain harm as we can see

on stream he pasted onto hmm they

566
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:48,928
created a little software injecting on

00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:51,809
the browser that makes massive analysis

568
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:54,570
there are so many like this this website

569
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:56,820

compromised interview information from

576
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,809
yourself can be a hack because you can

check it out on these websites have a

578
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:25,440
theme porn I appeared on so many

579
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:29,010
database in inventory lies from many

580
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,260
people check out all your email accounts

systematically and especially your

582
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,129
children's email accounts but you think

583
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,360
your children's you only have one single

584
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,160
email account that you are supposed to

585
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:42,840
have created back my our chili on

average have it among the 226 accounts

587
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,918
email account the my talk stemmed from

588
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,559
the fact of talking about opens Dec

589
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,850
typically send me the the front page of

590
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,309
your top because I don't want to get

591
00:29:53,850 --> 00:30:00,360
into the professional AI want to go into

592
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:01,720
the family issues this go through about

593
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,340
the office

594
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,650
operational security areas measured by

595
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:11,939
David we used to share a lot a lot of

596
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:15,340
encrypted message with people with bgp

597
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:19,120
where they sign up the signature of the

598
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:21,580
people signing after the PTB blog the

599
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,110
email so far there are certain group

600
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:28,960
certain people using the Berenstain a to

601
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:32,530
inversion with only by checking the tool

602
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,440
for PTP they can release a graph as i

603
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,550
show you before changing chaining and

604
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,530
linking all these people because they

605
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:40,389
are related using the tool and release

606
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:44,470
inversion I leave it there for your

607
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:46,510
consideration regarding exploits this

608
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:48,280
was released this way are there are so

609
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,920
many markets like this but it's so funny

610
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:53,080
because it seems like the periodical

611
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,960
table of elements just accompanied by

612
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,929
Express with the fees repent out that

613
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,970
they are remoted to executable local

614
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:04,510
allowing you to get on the Virtual

615
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,610
Machine flasher jab am and you there are

616
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:10,240
cause I was off to fight a hundred

617
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:12,520
thousand dollars we human beings people

618
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,510
tend to think that either cannot be

619
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:18,010
hacked or somebody has stickers

620
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:20,770
sequences and nobody's interests in

621
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:23,110
addition this is our two big three pig

622
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,150
alive everything any hack all doors open

623
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,719
or can be open through illegitimate

624
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,280
media's and medium we all have

625
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,010
interesting thing and security measures

626
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,350
are not enough to cope with them keep

627
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:39,250
this idea into consideration my goodness

628
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:42,159
we r 0 T and Derek became famous

629
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,560
famously upset and this is a tool for

630
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,120
those who had come for the family day

631
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,950
with this too I can check out for

632
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,860
connected devices on the Internet give

633
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:53,680
him master version and the name of them

634
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,949
and devise and knowing that I p if I

635
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,690
wanted if I want to attack somebody and

636
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,060
I can I can check the device with the

637
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:04,500
IBI start started looking for as

638
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:08,050
Schneider Electric of manufacturing

639
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,810
particular infrastructure actuator if I

640
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,539
knew that I can get all the data from

641
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,999
the word

642
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:17,869
you know I have I might have but some

643
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:19,429
evaluate the big exploited let's let me

644
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:24,379
go back to the fact that somebody came

645
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:26,269
by cell explicitly somebody can buy it

646
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:29,238
somebody finds a man already know

647
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:31,700
technology is marinating in the smart in

648
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:33,919
a counter in your house and think of

649
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,049
what it can have it's neither lecturing

650
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,879
webb says I'm take off my hat because

651
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:39,408
they are super cool people all the

652
00:32:37,879 --> 00:32:41,539
vulnerabilities of their products are

653
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:43,100
here this is good thing these guys have

654
00:32:41,539 --> 00:32:44,690
been responsible for another problem and

655
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,570
they are published in the banner of

656
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:49,639
these on their weapons I take off my hat

657
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:51,590
chapeau shop owned I would take them as

658
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:55,369
the bad example but it's a good example

659
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:57,228
good things they score na there what

660
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:59,478
happens with your credit cards you got

661
00:32:57,229 --> 00:33:02,269
some mcafee published an interesting

662
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:05,659
report regarding pricing lisk how much

663
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:07,279
and put car cause much unless it's very

learn

694
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:29,530
the pin by reversing the hotkey that the

695
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:33,460
biggest one you touch is colder and the

696
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:36,220
last one is hotter by reversing that the

697
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:39,490
temperature of them you can know it they

698

their handbag and touch their car is

707
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:12,850
super trivial yours european can be is

708
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,520
strolling with this kind of device these

709
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:19,690
false keyboards on the real keyboard

710
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,620
camera recording how you are happening

711
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:25,420
there are so many protection mechanisms

712
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,160
obviously competitions offering you you

713
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,520
service is the forward power of the

714
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,740
cloud you have a rut balls with 50 gigs

715
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,710
when you reason with my son some

716
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:38,319
telephone I get 50 gigs so both sound

717
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:41,800
and Dropbox know who I am talk each

718
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,900
other they send over data in between you

719
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,880
cannot do the ostrich strasser ye

720
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,440
cybersecurity issues are not going to

721
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,110
disappear for the fact you are put in

722
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,550
your head into the stand if you put it

723
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:54,070
the head into the Senja you're going to

724
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,330
get biggest words like basically good

725
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,220
you are response for that everything

726
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:59,290
that concerns in the cyber security is

727
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,700
you you are the responsible families and

728
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:03,190
professionals and when you have children

729
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,600
you are responsible for what it's

730
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,850
happening to your children you may not

731
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,880
need to make sure that the till don't be

732
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,710
ostriches because the big issues this

733
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,110
kind of affairs I'm fascinated about

734
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,060
that the point is that the primates and

735
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,530
a blue do not take into consideration

736
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,770
rigs and this is genetically and

737
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:25,090
evolutionary very fine we primates apes

738
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:27,280
monkeys do not take a valley do not take

739
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,440
Rick's entire value we only consider

740
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,200
eminent Rick's these people taking

741
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,660
pictures there where you can read

742
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,169
is fun do not enter end up in the

743
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:40,440
situation falling off the clave and they

744
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,880
get that because primates and I will do

745
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,680
not take Rick's into consideration

746
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,570
reflect on that money over whenever you

747
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,879
are going to take a Rick's decision in

748
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:54,210
your life you think twice professionals

749
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,420
do things very bad we professionals do

750
00:36:54,210 --> 00:37:00,720
back we spend a lot of money by putting

751
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,730
as links in this way they get rusty

752
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:07,200
somebody from Lauren station gets there

753
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:12,780
em you links these these links with them

754
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:15,540
a kind of calf Oh translate the people

755
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:18,900
are alienated with the business we need

756
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:21,089
to say no to responsible people if

757
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:25,079
somebody is doing things wrongly set

758
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:29,160
them now we have to work on big batch on

759
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:32,070
cyber security cyber security of doing

760
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,990
things on a big black home so no no less

761
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:37,050
create cyber security tools that every

762
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:40,140
human being can use with a guarantee one

763
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:42,660
of the two to create revolution was that

764
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:46,460
Windows you can have him a siphon

765
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:49,879
encrypted the less cups society have a

766
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:53,460
stenography their tools for them

767
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:56,099
intelligence agents and not too watching

768
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,770
you you need privacy ain't an intimate

769
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:01,380
if I were gay I'll be here sticking

770
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:03,869
around and hitting with sticks people

771
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,900
it's not true that terrorists and make

772
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:10,500
the most of privacy this much crude

773
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:13,680
let's create human based tools I want to

774
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:17,069
some are even possible I have my life is

775
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,598
connected on this and I classified dns I

776
00:38:17,069 --> 00:38:21,119
have communicated myself on an

777
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:23,250
electronic view I am a maniac about

778
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:26,579
technology I love it don't think that

779
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:28,470
I'm I'm sending you and terrifying this

780
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,480
course not now be responsible

781
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,910
responsible about your own cyber

782
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,260
security think that's the main thing

783
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:36,089
technology lets you to innovation

784
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,829
innovation is critical this please

785
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:43,290
finish people we knock invented in the

786
00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:45,090
Neolithic up around third

787
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:48,150
thousand years ago nobody thought about

788
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,230
improving an axe they improved is with

789
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,730
because there's always room for

790
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,680
innovation for professional something

791
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:57,000
semi circular you have to innovate work

792
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:59,899
a do it with a big button to spread it

793
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,490
around around all the Society for

794
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:05,010
citizens use them against and felonies

795
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:07,439
they have a lot of budget and they are

796
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,310
supposed to be good it showed your

797
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,270
channel what Vegeta 77 is are doing

798
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:17,070
useful ability of videos your children

799
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,500
can create a fabulous things on internet

800
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:21,030
instead being and a passion and how it

801
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:27,330
can be a word let's do it in a secure

802
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:30,150
way this is crazy when somebody

803
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:32,910
when a smoke sell ourselves it tells you

804
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:36,690
no nothing's happened some time ago they

805
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:38,549
hug a good girl accounts and responsible

806
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:41,640
from the person resources from google

807
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:45,300
said to us oh this is nothing important

808
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:48,060
because it's only 20 / 7 hack accounts

809
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:50,760
on google but didn't they didn't give

810
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:53,900
you any context 2% google accounts had

811
00:39:50,760 --> 00:40:01,110
but you started in calculating out the

812
00:39:53,900 --> 00:40:07,440
5000 55 million password accounts hack

813
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:09,840
and 100,000 people with email hack on

814
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,610
the database and somebody said to person

815
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,890
is not too much this is absolutely

816
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:16,490
irresponsible and you're responsible

817
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:20,069
people has to have to be punished I

818
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:23,069
demand from you I argue citizens to

819
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:25,290
punish people responsible for these

820
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:29,970
mistakes report this to the police

821
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:32,580
identify about back practices because

822
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,950
that's good thing with the security

823
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:37,650
issue but the bad people that we can

824
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,509
have to be done is and my daughter

825
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:43,950
security can be compromised as well you

826
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:48,510
need to generate a secret routine it's a

827
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:50,490
discipline as you unlock your house door

828
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,440

is a smart grid Temari we're giving a

861
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,149
lot of relevance to the fact ask how we

862
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:41,180
have be profiled by Google am faced with

863
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:44,000
with the smart grids and and this

864
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:47,690

internet-based profiles instead of

869
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:59,240

the money goes flying around with all

952
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,980
this because it's very insecure don safe

953
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:19,770
going in the internet I don't want I

954
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:22,860

answer don't take the idea that the

959
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:37,620
internet is unsecured internet is as the

960
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:40,140
straight as outside everything is in

961
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:44,130

967
00:47:55,620 --> 00:48:00,600
symptom of functional illiteracy you

968
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,930
have to be connected because all the

969
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,730
world is connected you can you can do

970
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:07,529
