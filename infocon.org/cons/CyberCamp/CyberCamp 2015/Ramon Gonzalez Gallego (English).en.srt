1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,890
hola buenas tardes a todos a SI como va

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:13,700
nandito so i am captain Tom Bogut Alice

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:17,369
I you know I work in the unit of

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,680
telematic crimes from Vargas wheel and

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,279
first of all let me tell you what we do

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,930
to fight cyber crimes and now I'd like

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,420
to share with you an example of the

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:34,800
operation that we Carrie's house and at

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:40,559
fighting cybercrimes cyber crimes that

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:44,550
are in drawing in the Tor network as I

11
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:49,110
say so I'll tell you what we do from the

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:52,530
Civil Guard and against cyber crimes

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,539
then our operation then I will tell you

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,739
about the process of investigation that

15
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:02,160
is to say all the steps that were taken

16
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:05,158
in up until we find the authors of the

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,679
crime and then I also would like to

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,479
finish by sharing with use most

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,850
frequently find problems so for you to

20
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,720
have some context as I say I work in

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:22,110
these units of telematic crimes this is

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,509
a group that depends from the operative

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,320
central unit perhaps you heard about it

24
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:33,380
before in the news the UCL and then we

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:37,770
are Civil Guards so Civil Guard and

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:40,350
technological crimes and fight of it is

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,170
divided in several branches and we have

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,689
we have the judicial police working with

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,210
the courts with the judges in all the

30
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,419
investigation tasks that are Cavett's

31
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:55,589
out to find the attackers so within that

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:00,990
we have departmental electronic and IT

33
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:05,390
department so they take care of carrying

34
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,390
out forensic analysis

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:15,079
and day that evidence is later on sent

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,260
out to the court then within the

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,310
technical challenge we have specialized

38
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:25,190
crime section and this section deals

39
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,320
with coordinating all the activities

40
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:31,460
carried out at the different units and

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:37,340
departments within civil guards so to

42
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:39,500
prevent overlapping so because in sams

43
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,180
but there may be the case that several

44
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,190
units are investigating on the same

45
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,340
topic and then we'll have the operative

46
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,020
central units taking care of

47
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,480
investigation about more complex issues

48
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,270
and international issues there are

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,170
several groups in here we have the drug

50
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:59,740
group the organized crime the economic

51
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:03,200
crimes and then that's where we are

52
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:06,500
telematic crimes and then in each of the

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:12,399
regions on his pain we have team the

54
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:16,780
team specializes in technological crimes

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,760
so they investigate this type of crimes

56
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,030
according to the competences some of

57
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,500
them have regional competences ok and

58
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,160
they investigate those cases that are

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,530
not very complex and then we have our

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,650
colleagues from the information system

61
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:38,380
through the technical area from the

62
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,380
electron group they deal with the

63
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:48,489
unfortunate and well unpleasant task of

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:54,170
converting of fighting cybercrime and

65
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:56,870
when such as jihadism so our mission

66
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,410
within the telematic group are very easy

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,540
to explain so the main one as you may

68
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:06,069
imagine is investigating those questions

69
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,349
that are related to IT crimes

70
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:10,719
the factor to find out whether it is an

71
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:13,108
investigation to do it ourselves to be

72
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:18,279
done by another one has to do with the

73
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:21,579
level of that research then whether it

74
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:24,270
is national or international and we also

75
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,860
help out our friends and the rest of the

76
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,299
UC 0 units to carry out the

77
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,460
investigation to give you everything

78
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:36,190
example any such warrants that we may do

79
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:40,030
for instance due to corruption latter

80
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,889
council for instance municipal

81
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,130
authorities well sometimes they find

82
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:49,509
difficulty in doing that sir choking

83
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:53,259
analyzing those files so we also deal

84
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:55,270
with training the stuff in the

85
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:59,020
departments that I mentioned before we

86
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:03,370
keep them updated so that they are more

87
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:06,130
efficient in what to do and the work in

88
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:10,919
a more coordinated manner so we also

89
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:13,900
attend several foreign we also

90
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,060
collaborate with FBI in child

91
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,090
pornography we are also members of an

92
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:23,199
Interpol group we are also members of

93
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:25,690
the FIGC group in South America so we

94
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,979
get lots of information from these

95
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:33,940
groups where we belong and I'm sure you

96
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:37,360
had word cybercrime very many times

97
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,039
before actually this term was defined

98
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,340
for the first time in the Budapest

99
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,919
agreement that took place in Budapest

100
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,020
back in two thousand and one that was

101
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,599
organized by the council of europe spain

102
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,310
ratified the agreement but what did not

103
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,440
implement it up until two thousand and

104
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,620
nine then it took nine years to

105
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:03,540
implement that agreements and base

106
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:06,300
the agreement defined cyber crimes cyber

107
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:09,270
crimes as such could be easily divided

108
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,250
in four major groups will have the more

109
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,070
unpleasant side which is the child

110
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,050
pornography each and every one of you

111
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:21,900
present here know very well what I'm

112
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:25,050
talking about then all the crimes that

113
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:28,380
we have all witnessed or suffered

114
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:31,080
ourselves will be internet fraud for

115
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:38,310
instance is stealing of banking details

116
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:42,090
or reese's fraud in website of websites

117
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:46,380
or any illicit activity on the internet

118
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:51,390
and then we also have all the crimes

119
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:54,000
that we have all committed at least once

120
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,820
in our life even if you don't admit it

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,230
and i'm referring to hacking and then

122
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,520
the purely crimes okay although

123
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,580
intellectual property for the previous

124
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,250
one and this one be hacking okay that is

125
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:13,590
to say no authorized access to IT

126
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:15,990
systems disruption of IT systems etc and

127
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,299
i'm not making this up okay all these

128
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:21,470
have been described and classified under

129
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,020
the Budapest agreement so after

130
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:29,570
presentation about who we are what we do

131
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:33,840
and why we do it we move on to our

132
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:36,840
operation anonymous animals operation

133
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,500
animals operation started kind of like a

134
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,750
practical joke so it says okay well a

135
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,710
person from the APA that goes and says

136
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:49,590
once I was comfortably my office when I

137
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:52,200
got a call from my FB an FEI colleague

138
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,090
and he told me the monk we need your

139
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,760
help from spain and i want to say yeah

140
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,529
okay mass but but would you need us for

141
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,859
but set of help do you need and

142
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:05,589
he said ok we are going to fight to cut

143
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:08,498
to launch an operation against or pages

144
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:10,119
one then when you hear that the first

145
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:13,589
thing that may come to mind is tor

146
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:17,199
holding this hammer but those of you who

147
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:20,609
don't know about or is that is not

148
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,189
doctor this is the tour that I'm

149
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:26,529
mentioning here so the second one that

150
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:28,539
have shown on the screen so how will

151
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:30,489
summarize it for you when you connect to

152
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:33,879
the internet often to do it from your

153
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:36,279
home and then you connect to the website

154
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:40,329
for instance el mundo Tess which is a

155
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:45,939
newspaper and then all the my IP address

156
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:48,519
is registered in the seventh so if

157
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:52,839
someone wants to see who has access and

158
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:55,540
window dot s my IP will show and then it

159
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,110
would also show the time and the date

160
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:02,170
when I connected door works like that

161
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,350
there are at least three in the memory

162
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:08,529
equipment intermediate equipments and

163
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:12,149
these equipment will not always will

164
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:12,149
change all the time they will change

165
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,689
you

166
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,689
you

167
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:30,980
a very difficult because that will go

168
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,410
through a server that is located in

169
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,079
China Brazil whatever and then 30

170
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,719
seconds later those three servants will

171
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:41,959
change their location across the world

172
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,209
and then Matt from the FBI told me that

173
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:48,109
they wanted to launch an operation to go

174
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:52,518
against tour and then they he said that

175
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:58,279
the target was the Silk Road it was the

176
00:09:52,519 --> 00:10:03,290
greatest online flea market for buying

177
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:07,209
and selling drugs it was what the

178
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:12,589
administrator was arrested in the US and

179
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:16,309
his name was Robert and he has given he

180
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:20,589
has been given life sentence in the u.s.

181
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:30,980
they offer Canada successes opioids

182
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:34,249
boosters so when after that after that

183
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,100
u.s. operation them some juicers created

184
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:39,740
silk road to and they continue to offer

185
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,829
the same type of stuff any type of drug

186
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:47,600
available from anywhere in the world and

187
00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:52,099
would you well the currency used was

188
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,860
Bitcoin and the objective was to crush

189
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,769
all the tour pages that have any type of

190
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:01,429
float there were very many other online

191
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:05,149
sites to sell drugs or illicit weapons

192
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:07,899
or any illicit things you can think of

193
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:12,379
for instance agri market revolution

194
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:15,649
cetera diese just some of them and

195
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:17,570
weren't FBI contacted us gave us in

196
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:22,580
Spanish I'd be

197
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:27,470
that belong to the control panel where

198
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:30,290
the administrator of your l2 websites

199
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:35,810
just to connect himself okay so they

200
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:38,689
gave us the URL onion so tour domains

201
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:43,270
are onion domains and then the second

202
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:46,640
let us go and look at it however

203
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,740
disheartened problem the thing is that

204
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,470
we got those data on the thirtieth of

205
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:58,360
sep tember and it sold us at 21

206
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:58,360
countries will be taken joint action

207
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:06,920
planned for the 27th of october as you

208
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:10,910
can imagine I don't know what I do being

209
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,310
involved in any court cases or not but I

210
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:18,439
can tell you that trying to resolve this

211
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:21,560
type of situation in over in only 27

212
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,830
days it's very difficult thing to do and

213
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,959
it happens a bit like happen to the

214
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:31,250
Alice in Wonderland rabbit that is to

215
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:35,450
say we had to hurry up okay yes to meet

216
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:38,660
that deadline for the joint action so

217
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:41,350
when we got access to the URL this is

218
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,350
what we found

219
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:48,219
so the website and that was controlled

220
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:51,109
from Spain it was known as fast cash I

221
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:56,660
did offer the buying and selling of

222
00:12:51,110 --> 00:13:00,350
false Europe notes so this is what they

223
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:08,868
offer 5 10 euro notes for 25 thousand

224
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:11,629
euros 110 euro note for 60 etc etc so we

225
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:14,119
looked closer into the website and to

226
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:16,309
the contents of it and we could also see

227
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:18,860
that they were offering the delivery of

228
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:22,029
this false currency anywhere in the

229
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:28,300
world the currency to pay for those

230
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:33,439
items was bitcoins and also hear the

231
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:38,868
were good reviews positive feedback by

232
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:45,649
users so they were just saying that that

233
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:48,189
was a good website to buy false notes so

234
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:52,549
we could clearly see that either

235
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:56,269
currency was being tampered or forged or

236
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:59,589
perhaps this most as the fraud website

237
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,589
trying to

238
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:08,260
to fraud anyone visiting it that is to

239
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:13,119
say scum however those reviews the use

240
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:15,850
of Bitcoin and finding it in turn took

241
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,730
us to think that this has to do with the

242
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,980
forgery of coins and notes because we

243
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:24,089
were very much in a hurry we just all

244
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:30,209
those data and we went to the IT

245
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:33,459
criminality office and we told them

246
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:39,040
everything that we were involved we told

247
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:42,430
them how much in a hurry we were because

248
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:47,199
all the Isaac crimes and that's it

249
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:50,739
placing toward nowadays our kind of they

250
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,779
go on kind of unpunished so they believe

251
00:14:50,740 --> 00:15:01,930
that they can do whatever they want to

252
00:14:52,779 --> 00:15:04,420
do and go unpunished so our friends also

253
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:08,439
reach the same conclusion they said that

254
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:14,319
yes that did was over cedar like forgery

255
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:17,760
of notes and coins or just Sutherland

256
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,790
sites so we went and talked to them

257
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:26,920
judge and he gave us a judicial order a

258
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:29,770
court order Saudi IP was located in the

259
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,079
municipality in Barcelona however when

260
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,810
we looked at the details of the person

261
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,029
link to that IP didn't really make any

262
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:42,609
sense to us because it was just a

263
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:47,079
plumber advanced age man and he was not

264
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:51,700
he didn't look like highly experts in

265
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:54,939
terms of managing working with Bitcoin

266
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:58,480
center etc so several questions came to

267
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,970
us so the first one is as you may

268
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,260
imagine is whether the Wi-Fi had been

269
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:09,130
committed or not whether that home and

270
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:13,400
Wi-Fi hotspot had been compromised

271
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:16,700
that the security of the Wi-Fi have been

272
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:21,740
breached and then the IP of that plumber

273
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:26,480
was being used pull this data made us

274
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:29,210
doubt made us a few doubts and then we

275
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:35,270
decided to go to the spot to go inside

276
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:37,670
and to analyze the traffic the Wi-Fi

277
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:43,220
traffic of the connections in the area

278
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:56,120
we went over there reduce Jones such as

279
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:58,850
acrylic Wi-Fi and what was actually what

280
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,210
we were very very much surprised okay

281
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:08,860
because we couldn't really find any

282
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:08,860
illicit use of the Wi-Fi of the plumber

283
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:16,160
so we were taken aback by that somebody

284
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:20,119
still we thought that this person was

285
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,210
not related to the actual dream and I

286
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,609
say okay let us go beyond that and let

287
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:29,030
us try to find someone who meets that

288
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:32,419
profile and then we asked ourselves well

289
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:36,530
did we find the plumber in the social

290
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:39,530
networks did we researched about him did

291
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,660
we find out about his friends and

292
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,290
actually yes this person has a facebook

293
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,350
profile then we looked into his facebook

294
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:51,260
profile and they were there was no

295
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:54,409
clothes nothing took us to what we were

296
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:58,450
looking for but we wanted to gossip and

297
00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:02,770
then we wanted to find out who he has

298
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:06,340
engaging in communication with so this

299
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,340
device is

300
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:18,210
that was a medicaments that was a drag

301
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:24,220
medical drug and he was wearing this

302
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:27,400
bitcoin bitcoin t-shirt sake look more

303
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:31,240
like a freak now so if you were a

304
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:35,110
Bitcoin t-shirt means that you love or

305
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,660
that July that coin at least you are

306
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,580
interested in it and then I said okay

307
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,780
let us try to find more information

308
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:47,590
about him so we didn't contact the NSA

309
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:52,379
or anything so all the information was

310
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:57,100
open so sometimes crimes or attackers

311
00:18:52,380 --> 00:19:01,360
home eat this type of mistakes and then

312
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:04,480
we found news that are being uploaded by

313
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:10,679
this person that was the piece of news

314
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:14,980
that was broadcasted on TV and then this

315
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:19,690
person has just also posted a comment a

316
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:22,210
comment saying now you know a gay so we

317
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:26,110
could see that notes and thank his

318
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:29,950
comments and that you about saying that

319
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:32,080
you already know about it so then again

320
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,110
we became more more interested in the

321
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,090
pestle we continue looking into his

322
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:45,129
profile and then he had also posted this

323
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:49,149
cartoon and he was kind of making a joke

324
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:52,480
of FBI and the activities that were

325
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:57,700
launching against tour and then we said

326
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:00,790
okay he is very much like the person we

327
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:03,070
are looking for now okay we had his face

328
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:07,000
okay but we didn't have his action name

329
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:10,960
he had a false profile on facebook and

330
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,260
actually he was using a woman's name so

331
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,050
we could have

332
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:19,260
investigators the no keys register the

333
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:22,889
municipality etc but he made it much

334
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:25,379
easier for us he had a bloated and

335
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:28,890
photograph he had been involved in a car

336
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,110
accident with the registration play in

337
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,840
the clear and we just entered the

338
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:37,290
registration plate and we found this

339
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,620
person he was an in Argentinian man and

340
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:43,230
he lived in the Barcelona municipality

341
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,300
and actually he was living quite close

342
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,100
to the plumber and there was a

343
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:52,110
relationship between the two because he

344
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:54,840
was he was the brother of the boyfriend

345
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,790
of the daughter of the comma okay well

346
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:02,340
they knew each other again to keep it

347
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:08,100
short once we found the person we

348
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:13,530
continue looking into him and then we

349
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:18,209
could also see we found conversations

350
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:23,160
with other Facebook users the were Wi-Fi

351
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:30,360
intruders and were just mentioning oh I

352
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:33,210
cracked Wi-Fi hub Wi-Fi networks etc and

353
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:39,360
he was showing off she was showing off

354
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:42,360
about reaching Wi-Fi security still we

355
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,979
didn't have any evidence so he also

356
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:52,500
talked to a person who had a printer so

357
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:56,070
it was a t-shirt printer it is true but

358
00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:01,760
when you are looking for a person that

359
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:04,850
forges coins and notes well

360
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:08,750
seeing that he was in contact with a

361
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:13,149
person who had a printer took us to

362
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:16,700
think that perhaps if they try sided

363
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,950
printing facility were to be printed we

364
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,700
have to be changed well it could easily

365
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:26,480
end up printing notes so therefore we

366
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:30,470
focused more moon on him and then from

367
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,200
that we asked for a search warrant so we

368
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,870
asked the judge to give us a search

369
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,870
warrants so that we could go to the home

370
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:43,659
of that person and then to confiscate

371
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:48,350
these devices that are related with the

372
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:51,500
crime that is being investigated so we

373
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:56,090
asked for two search warrants one for

374
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:58,910
diploma and the other one from him so we

375
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:02,060
expected to find at least some clues in

376
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:04,970
the router of the plumber and also on

377
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,340
the Argentinean man so what we've been

378
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:10,490
looking for something very simple as a

379
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:16,399
nevada you have tried to open up a web

380
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:19,460
site on the web on the tour web so to do

381
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,850
so you need a private key file the same

382
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:26,090
as when you use PGP or any encryption

383
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:32,750
program accessing the control platinum

384
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:39,320
is that for a private key file so we had

385
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:42,560
all these clues all this data or these

386
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:47,450
details however we needed to find the

387
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:50,990
file to say that he was actually linked

388
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:55,400
to the crime so for us finding that

389
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:57,800
public key was key the key for us so

390
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,170
first of all we went to do the domicile

391
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:04,570
of this person and we found very many

392
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:09,370
things okay kiha good money cash

393
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:17,009
he also hard like virginal blank credit

394
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:21,360
cards he also had a card writing machine

395
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:27,730
he had also bought and sold drugs on

396
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:30,158
tour website so we could really see that

397
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:35,200
this person had a good knowledge about

398
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:38,850
the use of new technologies and actually

399
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:42,730
we were most interested in looking into

400
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:47,830
his IT equipment so the first thing that

401
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:49,600
we did was to prepare some strips so

402
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,059
that by the time we will go into his

403
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,439
computer we could find any file selling

404
00:24:52,059 --> 00:25:01,750
us that it was a bit fine Bitcoin thurs

405
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:07,090
any bit coin purse that would allow us

406
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:11,350
to see the receipt of pump transfers

407
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:13,418
that would be a very good evidence ok we

408
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,389
just the script and then right away we

409
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:19,210
could access to the Bitcoin purses but

410
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:22,240
still we didn't have the private key

411
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:24,370
file that I mentioned before ok so this

412
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,659
looks like a joke but actually this was

413
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:31,229
true and actually we scan the most

414
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:31,230
widely used

415
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:43,080
folders and then we found this mp3 file

416
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:47,790
it referred to over whose name was you

417
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:54,270
already know this okay and this was not

418
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:57,330
in the folder to of downloads or it was

419
00:25:54,270 --> 00:26:00,540
just in a different folder folder that

420
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:04,949
also included some txt files etc and

421
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:08,040
then we did right click on the file and

422
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:14,640
then we looked at the size of it was two

423
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:19,230
megabytes so often mp3 files do not are

424
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:26,360
not to megabytes files often there are 4

425
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:30,240
8 12 megabytes so exactly two megabytes

426
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,668
make us made a suspect that was really

427
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,580
really strange and then when we asked

428
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:37,650
him well this file is not what it looks

429
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,909
like it's indeed he didn't give us an

430
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:45,860
insanity he refused to give us an answer

431
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:48,270
so we decided to download the ram memory

432
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:50,309
because we wanted to extract the

433
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:53,100
password of applications that were

434
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:55,799
recently used and well when he could see

435
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,709
us that he told us this is a container

436
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:00,929
of truecrypt that i created when we

437
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:06,600
opened that up with a password that he

438
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:11,460
gave us because he gave up so we found

439
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:14,520
the public key Oh private key to the

440
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:18,080
website so let us say that our work was

441
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:24,299
kind of well finished than or completed

442
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:26,760
still I had a question a question that I

443
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:30,690
wanted to answer and as I said we

444
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:34,020
analyzed Wi-Fi

445
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:36,660
password on site to vent out with us

446
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,450
some of them had been breached or not so

447
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:42,930
we went to the home of the plumber and

448
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:48,690
we found exactly this on the left the

449
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:55,320
laptop was configured with the website

450
00:27:48,690 --> 00:28:00,290
and our real suspects the Argentinian

451
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:03,990
man connected himself to the server of

452
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:09,480
the father of the girlfriend of his

453
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:12,120
brother he used to connect remotely and

454
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,820
then when we ask the plumber how to

455
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:17,909
reload allowed for that to happen at

456
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:20,939
your home and he said look having asked

457
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:24,780
to do that favor to them and I let them

458
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:29,070
do it so the plumber had the server at

459
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:32,940
home as avatar was accessed remotely by

460
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:35,520
our suspect man and then on the right

461
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,340
you see those three green lights and for

462
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,790
those of you who don't know this is like

463
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:44,429
a small farm of bitcoins these are like

464
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:51,990
a small carts of bitcoins that have been

465
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:56,190
prepared with the GPU cpu to process day

466
00:28:51,990 --> 00:29:01,170
data of blocks of data for Bitcoin and

467
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:04,770
to mine to do Bitcoin mining so that is

468
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:07,260
not a crime but still we were surprised

469
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:13,280
again as how passionate this man was

470
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:18,040
formed about Bitcoin and as I say we got

471
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:21,430
the last answer to have a last question

472
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,260
and then well the but we could not

473
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:26,470
understand in the beginning was later

474
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:32,800
not yet because we could see now that he

475
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:39,940
was acting remotely I what did we find

476
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:43,389
in the home of the suspect so we found a

477
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:47,080
txt file of his equipment with access

478
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:50,320
key to more than 120 Wi-Fi networks

479
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,290
around his home we checked them one by

480
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,740
one and we could really see that they

481
00:29:53,290 --> 00:30:00,450
were located in the neighborhood because

482
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:04,330
we wanted to identify possible victims

483
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:07,780
also very important the security of

484
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:10,480
Wi-Fi networks please improve them so

485
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,850
that people like himself do not reach

486
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,180
into your network and get you into

487
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:24,939
trouble we also found credit card blank

488
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:27,160
credit cards so someone who moves about

489
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:33,760
in your juicy store is very likely to

490
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:41,260
buy monkey tails just to trade or to

491
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:45,190
copy credit card then the balance or in

492
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:48,520
the Bitcoin purse was around 17 perhaps

493
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:54,070
that doesn't look very high amount to

494
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:56,560
you but a bitcoin is 341 euros so the

495
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,020
benefit or the profit the profit that he

496
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:02,590
had made with a make him rich but still

497
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:07,110
he had made a profit so we also find the

498
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:12,270
private a key to access the panel of the

499
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:16,000
website which was a key evidence and

500
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:18,370
also very important this person has good

501
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,400
technical knowledge when you take it the

502
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:25,000
position to person that you're arresting

503
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:27,010
you kind of feel like sympathetic you

504
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,920
know to that person and I talking to are

505
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,110
too smart to do this kind of nonsense

506
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:37,280
I love the nonsense that he did is that

507
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:39,929
he breached the encryption of the Metro

508
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,270
tickets that are using Barcelona

509
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,190
actually because he wanted to save like

510
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:46,350
a euro and I said why don't you use all

511
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:48,660
due respect ease for something else

512
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:52,230
which is more important than just to

513
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:58,140
breach and metro ticket and he had

514
00:31:52,230 --> 00:32:00,300
bought a drugs on tour and then we also

515
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,190
got all those details for further

516
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,020
investigation this is part of another

517
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,510
investigation that is being carried out

518
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:17,280
today so we also found two thousand

519
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:20,970
euros in cash in principle with what we

520
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:25,260
can confront in a very severe criminal

521
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:29,580
to act upon it style doing buying

522
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,980
selling of bills nodes with bitcoins but

523
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,439
in the very end we end up knowing that

524
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,950
sadly anything we are this we are like

525
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:42,360
this instead having big criminal we we

526
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:46,520
found a simple hamster and froster we

527
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:49,740
were able to confront an act on this

528
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:52,170
scam headlines on the newspapers are

529
00:32:49,740 --> 00:33:00,060
today's operation the newspaper by is

530
00:32:52,170 --> 00:33:03,630
they reflected the RMS operation to wrap

531
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:06,210
up I want to reflect on this boy I want

532
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:10,170
allowed out even a scam case like this

533
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:14,870
as of today can have complications a big

534
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:18,030
scale / firstly how its it tremendously

535
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:21,479
easy for users not to use secure eyes

536
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:24,510
their Wi-Fi networks this super easy to

537
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,870
bond rate your neighboring Wi-Fi people

538
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:31,920
surrounding us you can accept them and

539
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:33,219
it is more difficult for us to keep

540
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:39,210
track of the connection

541
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:42,490
so we can use say the big godless

542
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:48,539
networks asking using remotely infected

543
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:51,480
networks sorry for this some caffeine

544
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:55,510
more and more frequently we can find

545
00:33:51,480 --> 00:34:02,580
encryption tools which make difficult to

546
00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:06,760
obtain any digital indexes of science or

547
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:09,848
do tips in this case the password was

548
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,800
around but for many other cases if I

549
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:13,929
have the computer switch off and the

550
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:18,250
person does not want to cooperate that

551
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:23,560
is so difficult to access all that this

552
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:26,889
e ciphered in a container tricky typing

553
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:30,369
any encryption application and is the

554
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:33,040
very same difficulty to break password

555
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:36,580
with the encryption program having a

556
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:42,099
cipher and algorithm cipher pretty good

557
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:45,869
it takes cells if it's 80 if he's eight

558
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:49,810
Carter takes eight months but it is over

559
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:52,990
more many more characters Texas years

560
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:58,000
and centuries millions in this very case

561
00:34:52,989 --> 00:35:03,009
is person obtained a benefit of 16-bit

562
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:07,510
coins and cash money but regardless to

563
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:11,050
say needless to say that certain big

564
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:14,859
organization had found Bitcoin the two

565
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:17,170
that as per se because is useful but in

566
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:20,348
the hands of the cybercriminals allows

567
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:22,599
to do money laundering of capitals very

568
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:26,619
quickly rather than going to the

569
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:30,130
traditional banking and if you start

570
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:33,910
moving money the fruit of the crime

571
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:37,600
through Bitcoin base models and you use

572
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:40,319
certain criminal companies taking out

573
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:44,470
this vid cons and put it in different

574
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:47,470
purses with intermediate process to make

575
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:52,689
hard to track him it's difficult for us

576
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:57,399
gives it the track of everything last

577
00:35:52,690 --> 00:36:02,140
lame 40 or are any anonymous navigation

578
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:04,900
browsing to these are flattened that on

579
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:08,850
their own do not damage any volume the

580
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:13,180
update they were born with objective of

581
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:15,930
guaranteeing the privacy freedom of

582
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,899
speech in countries with to suppress

583
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:23,290
prison but in the hands of criminals

584
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:27,760
they make difficult to locate the

585
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:32,050
criminals compared to the claim

586
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:36,610
navigation with anonymous operation we

587
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:40,830
and dad making criminals knowing that we

588
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:43,180
can act against an on tour we found any

589
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:47,830
person accessing any of the pages

590
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:51,190
intervened gearing is carrying out and

591
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:54,310
the global action sometimes we make

592
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:56,950
mistakes and we're humans and the action

593
00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:03,160
clash of global action with yet that day

594
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:05,919
we see is 430 size on tour besides we

595
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:10,620
intervene over 1 million euros in

596
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:16,480
bitcoins over 180,000 euros in cash

597
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:19,029
drugs weapons shows such a big effort

598
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,090
to be carried out by the international

599
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:25,690
community in order to release the

600
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:28,630
messages no matter what kind of break

601
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,910
point and break through to two years you

602
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:33,520
have to act on it police sighs before

603
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:39,879
this is it should be interested in

604
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:45,490
asking questions we can open the floor

605

608
00:37:51,670 --> 00:38:01,900
scam mean in English sometimes we use

00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:21,070
gate will give the way to use 1 million

614
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:23,350
years scam are all these comms on the

615
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,960
internet in this case was not these

616
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:30,100
obvious but is it was a camp base some

617
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,320
con you accessed your face with the

618
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:36,910
proper because it was open should it be

619
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:39,910
em in a private profile should be asking

620
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:42,430
permission from NSA let's do it out

621

investigation it was it was a joke many

626
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:58,060
people believe that the loan form is

627
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,190
good hot free access to all the

628
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,340
information available so many times on

629
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:06,550
the newspapers we get it information NSA

630
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,770
is monitoring connections this head

631
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:10,030
distance make happen in the state I can

632

I can do so by an injection issued by a

639
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:33,099
spain's huge judge the chairs the mary

640

confess with company players you have to

641
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:39,519
facilitate me this information so you

642
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:45,848
need a judge order to do so in spam any

643
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:48,368
more questions hello I can see my hands

644
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:52,480
to the back of the room congratulations

want to ask you a question it told does

647
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:02,738
this person had to find this computer

648
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:06,369
with over 100 passwords from their

649
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:08,529
neighbors in you loyally checked out

650
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:11,769
that these passwords corresponded to the

651
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:14,619
Wi-Fi password how can you do so without

652
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:16,569
going into these Reuters did you connect

653
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:19,390
these waffles to something what kind of

654
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:22,829
permission the obtained for that what is

655

close to you in this case we walk around

660
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:46,029
around data in this trigger on Barcelona

661
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:48,339
and we saw that the access point was

662
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:52,150
close enough to us so we knock at the

663
00:40:48,339 --> 00:40:57,069
door are you the owner of the access

664
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:58,450
point WL and what's your password is you

665
00:40:57,069 --> 00:41:01,299
have to know that you're that's where is

666
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,749
as bond rate is attacked it's as simple

667
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:03,749
as that

668
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:18,109
this week last week a new scandal came

669
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:20,900
out the FBI used a nut company to make

670
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:22,578
the tour protocol anonymous this

671
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:27,079
intervention was part of this

672
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:29,749
investigation I don't know we when we

673
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:32,569
receive information from a country we

674
00:41:29,749 --> 00:41:36,979
only ask something like is this

675
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:39,619
information obtained in a legal way the

676
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:43,759
American info from Americans will obtain

677
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:47,150
an illegally we apply the principle of

678
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:50,180
Europe lucidity of the proof the way the

679
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:53,049
makin they did you have to double check

680
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:59,989
with them I cannot help you in decision

681
00:41:53,049 --> 00:42:03,769
actually Americans I could even once the

682
00:41:59,989 --> 00:42:07,279
scissors of bitcoins made our day store

683
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:10,999
nerves Bitcoin the folder or our chains

684
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:14,329
into euros Oh somebody while tapping on

685
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:19,339
you that's a very good question how can

686
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:23,089
I answer back to you when we see is the

687
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:25,460
two thousand euros in cash is easy what

688
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:29,450
we had to do you take the two thousand

689
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:32,420
euros the judge officer very fact there

690
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:35,058
is cash two thousand you put it in an

691
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:38,359
envelope you go to the the physical band

692
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:40,479
in the with the neck down administered

693
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:43,160
by the administration of justice and you

694
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:48,259
deposit the money physically in this

695
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:52,489
banking around with the UCSB continuing

696
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:56,239
the Bitcoin pocket the you went to the

697
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:59,289
court and you said oh your honor the

698
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:02,630
bitcoins are in this USB this is a file

699
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:06,710
Your Honor if you put it in circulation

700
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:09,769
through out this programs is worth this

701
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:14,059
money so keep it there and let's see if

702
00:43:09,769 --> 00:43:15,660
I can move it after that after we can

703
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:18,470
have conducted

704
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:22,288
several meetings with prosecutors in the

705
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:25,410
Minister of Justice us to the fact that

706
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:28,819
the administration has to create Bitcoin

707
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:33,240
pockets and purses to transfer the

708
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:35,569
bitcoins seeds into the administration

709
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,399
of justice there are two kinds of purses

710
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:42,619
basically speaking there is the physical

711
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:46,530
top first which is a file a top of five

712
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:47,900
should you intervene it you the criminal

713
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:53,579
kind of access with their other

714
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:55,500
synchronize purses on email accounts if

715
00:43:53,579 --> 00:44:00,329
you want to block them you need to

716
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:02,220
transfer them into an account controlled

717
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:04,920
by the ministry of justice but also you

718
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:07,950
have to change the access password that

719
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,420
person had otherwise that criminals have

720
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:13,348
the opportunity to recover drop out the

721
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:17,450
generalization and mr. Patil have to

722
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:21,390
create Bitcoin accounts to seize them

723
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:25,618
any more questions is it true that this

724
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:29,190
thing's state has spanned many many

725
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:33,660
millions of euros in hacker in hacking

726
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:35,579
hacking team applications are you

727
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:39,450
talking about the Italian Italian press

728
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:42,240
I'm gonna tell something we were with

729
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,220
material I'd like to have as much money

730
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,750
as they say to buy so many things as

731
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,930
they say in my particular case I can

732
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:51,750
tell you that the Spain and cigar didn't

733
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:55,160
didn't buy anything from the hacking

734
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,160
team not natural

735
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:05,750
anyone else wants to do to pose a

736
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:08,450
question hello I would like to know if

737
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:11,270
the civil servant was accused of

738
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:14,359
complicity as it happens with the

739
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:16,970
conventional crimes I can't hear you I'd

740
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:19,160
like to know the planner the plumber the

741
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:26,689
planner was accused of be accomplished

742
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:30,529
of complicity now when the plumber was

743
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:33,020
the pillows in US charts person today it

744
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:36,470
would be an investigative person because

745
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:39,140
the criminal operates change at first

746
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:40,870
moment in time you can't know that the

747
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:45,890
fact that the city was at is other

748

president of the lawyer and for the

752

person should be charged with them in

753

our opinion the report we notice that

754
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:01,730
the planet did not have criminal

755

didn't do it nothing wrong this is my

757
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:09,860
opinion plumber this plumber who was

758
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:12,950
unaware of the condition system in his

759
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:16,480
house this is another crime this is

760
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:16,480
ignorance simply speaking

761
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:28,868
thank you very very much I would like to

762
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:32,040
ask you something yeah give us said that

763
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:33,910
by using these bitcoins and you other

764
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,830
companies can use it for money

765
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:43,149
laundering all kind of laundry nice ice

766
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:45,670
and I seem o bells ringing I know we're

767
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:49,800
in a junior talk with Chema along so

768
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:53,350
many people use those tortillas

769
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:56,350
applications they upload gain or some

770
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:58,390
types of game where you can buy things

771
00:46:56,350 --> 00:47:01,540
with virtual money and they do this

772
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:04,839
money laundering through buying these

773
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:08,410
kind of applications how can you act

774
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:10,360
under the in this regard and how can we

775
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:14,049
help you out of the situation how can

776
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:17,050
you how can give you how to detect this

777
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:20,520
kind of them wicked people you're asking

778
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:23,650
me that there are some money laundering

779
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:27,009
to such as using virtual currency and

780
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:29,710
online game platforms yeah equally

781
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:35,200
equally likewise how can we combat that

782
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:37,119
in fact how can we avoid it is so very

783
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:41,140
very briefly there are some games where

784
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:44,830
they start giving away virtual money in

785
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:49,330
indiscriminate away directly the users

786
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:52,900
start them downloading the this hacking

787
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:56,319
fans by enabling a virtual unlimited

788
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:58,300
money you know I don't know hide words

789
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:02,260
how engineering is working in this

790
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:04,930
regard how can you justify this from the

791
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:08,980
from a gain engineering viewpoint video

792
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:11,919
games uploaded on facebook I wouldn't

793
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,570
tell you in private which ones are but

794
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,300
I've actually cheerly specific that the

795
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:20,350
day is that on facebook bear in mind

796
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:22,930
something and the validity of virtual

797
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:25,830
currency to depends on the value that

798
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:28,720
the user gets it if you have a virtual

799
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:31,450
currency but it's not acceptable the

800
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,029
value of that is not as void so

801
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:37,689
for those some virtual currency tools

802
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:41,800
which real are worth money the brief

803
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:45,430
first virtual currency was that the

804
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:48,130
dollar Linder aye you know familiar

805
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:51,520
about that for the geeks of second life

806
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:55,560
for the virtual world being the very

807
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:57,490
first created all these companies using

808
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:02,980
virtual currency with the real

809
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:06,669
distribution decree are obliged to the

810
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:10,210
normal obligations applicable way the

811
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:14,950
r18 and tendering they have to be

812
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:18,220
control of the deposits made in real

813
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:21,399
money transfers out outside the inside

814
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:23,919
but we discover a big hole to manual

815
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,100
laundromat now I develop certain

816
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:32,440
measures that allow us to detect very

817
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:34,870
easily if these holes are used for money

818
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,020
laundering I'll give you an example it

819
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:41,859
has to do with poker online if I got

820
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:45,780
there and I put two thousand euros on a

821
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:49,030
 lyin town and I take them out

822
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:51,190
some years ago if I put in three

823
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:54,730
thousand years on on poker online

824
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:56,710
