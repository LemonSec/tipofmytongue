1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,770
corner when I start ASAP dollars hey

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:08,580
good afternoon everyone first of all

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:10,230
thank you much for coming the

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,059
presentation will deal with cyberspace

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,120
and terrorism and first of all I like to

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,720
warn you here since the conference is

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,850
focused on families and students and

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,519
people who may not be experts in this

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,900
world I've made a presentation easy for

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,919
everyone to understand so it's not as

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,098
technical but rather social so people

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:36,949
can understand which is the main problem

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:39,930
of terrorism within cyberspace

14
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:42,000
so there is a short index here we will

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:46,680
give a few warnings and interruption but

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,079
first of all just few warnings essential

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:54,629
due to the geopolitical international

18
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:59,159
situation we're experiencing is peace

19
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:02,849
essential not to identify Muslims with

20
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:06,710
terrorists you're like my questions are

21
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,710
not all extreme right

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:17,260
or half questionable practices we tie

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,259
this into account otherwise we can

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,130
find several designs on social networks

25
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:26,720
the show the right-wing Christian

26
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,720
Christians only represent themselves

27
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:37,990
while Osama bin Laden represents all

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,969
fanatical Muslim terrorists and this is

29
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,890
about understanding of the terrorism

30
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:44,469
phenomenon the second warning is the

31
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:48,520
power of words as you may know in media

32
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:50,318
there are given a lot of importance to

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,240
the idea of calling dodge to Islamic

34
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:57,609
state even though is a different detail

35
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,949
is important to call a spade a spade if

36
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:01,658
we call them Islamic state we're given

37
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,479
them a small victory in each take that

38
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,810
into account thirdly we have an immature

39
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,090
buttock lung or the unfortunate

40
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,670
murderers of you days ago in Paris when

41
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:15,489
these things are dealt with in the

42
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,988
rabbit public and political spheres it

43
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,299
looks like this threat is very far away

44
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:22,900
from our lives and when these things

45
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:25,000
happen unfortunately we realize we're

46
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,760
all potential actives of terrorism and

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,030
cyber terrorism so from here we would

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,649
like to make everyone pay attention to

49
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,190
this reflect on this because

50
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,720
unfortunately is a very real threat

51
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,950
regarding the interaction cyber space

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,260
and cyber terrorism some people ask us

53
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:47,290
who will deal with our security in the

54
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,660
future our colleagues from the

55
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:52,120
Communists have a very interesting kick

56
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,340
critical imagination that and they were

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,890
asked well what would be the war

58
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,069
regarding on the future look like

59
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:02,260
and there's a this biggest strong but

60
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:04,390
there's a little guy here saying yo dude

61
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,040
I'm back here on the one dealing with

62
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,069
security but the paradigm has already

63
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,359
changed now these are people that from a

64
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:14,769
sofa may protect us or attackers and we

65
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,630
went from something material to

66
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,090
something virtual Angus essential

67
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:23,170
Granderson days he's a massive part I'm

68
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:27,130
changing our society he's not like Blair

69
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:30,040
or silver or the amount of assets tanks

70
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,900
or bullets you have but rather the heat

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,420
and virtual capability you have to

72
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,459
attack a protected so the main game of

73
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,850
our speech please to understand why

74
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,830
terrorism has provoked for enjoyed a

75
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,959
transition to the network to internet in

76
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:47,260
the cyberspace so we have three main

77
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,269
objectives first do is start with the

78
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,250
bases why don't we have tourism

79
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,989
definition and therefore definition of

80
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:58,330
cyber terrorism and why that creates a

81
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,340
serious problems secondly we'll try to

82
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,260
explain why terrorists I identified

83
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:07,150
several spaces very important platforms

84
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:09,190
for the propaganda recruiting tasks and

85
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,340
thirdly try to build some alternatives

86
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:15,370
and solutions allow us to shortcut the

87
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,370
problem objective number one from the

88
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,350
back sees wiser a lack of definition of

89
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,040
the cyber terrorism in terrorism first

90
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,870
of all is a security threat no doubt

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,190
it'll push on cars a certain rational

92
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:32,830
and there are many experts in this topic

93
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:35,620
there are trying to pay attention to

94
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,830
face not just for Illuminati that think

95
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:42,100
of attacking us setting up for bombs or

96
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,750
going into Martha clan they have a

97
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,169
calculation system that is right for

98
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,660
them does mean that is the world

99
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:52,500
legitimate in it or just fine however to

100
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,500
understand threat

101
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,520
attack it neutralizes them combat it we

102
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:03,320
need to know where it's coming from from

103
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:05,690
our ride rational calculation however

104
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,659
nowadays we still don't have terrorism

105
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,400
or cyber terrorism that is globally

106
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:14,900
accepted in that house Rachel consensus

107
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,810
unfortunately due to lack of political

108
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,390
will hang everything's are slightly many

109
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,180
different interests are we as we can see

110
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:28,280
in our national newspapers we have

111
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:30,950
putting Obama alarmed concern about

112
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,070
whether he sands national coalition to

113
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,780
combat Lisa nom nom and this

114
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:40,550
confrontation of interests these are

115
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:42,469
there is to everyone refined terrorism

116
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,080
in a different way based on their

117
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,360
position since there is no consensus we

118
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:52,370
cannot come back something on which we

119
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,550
don't agree secondly why is iris plays

120
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,620
the new field of action of terrorism

121
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:01,280
first of all we may imagine that we have

122
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,740
a colleague with lumberjack t-shirt our

123
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,739
neighbor and a good looking girl they

124
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,410
need to come out some tasks such as

125
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:11,350
doing the shopping doing that tax return

126
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,450
form

127
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:15,190
I'm a silly romantic I still go shopping

128
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,500
even though these things take time I

129
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,200
were very firm offered to do it through

130
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,360
a tablet tour the internet is much more

131
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,659
comfortable so there's a trend for easy

132
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,730
access is much cheaper much more

133
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,070
operational to everything through mobile

134
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,470
or the computer and as we all know there

135
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,930
was a trend do take everything just on

136
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,720
respects with internet and there is a

137
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,240
problem there because we're not the only

138
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,780
ones who transfer how tasks to the

139
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,450
internet but we have also created a

140
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,260
massive amount or massive increase of

141
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:52,690
our independence to the virtual media

142
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:56,440
all the critical infrastructures such as

143
00:06:52,690 --> 00:07:00,190
the underground water electricity energy

144
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,230
generation all that depends on internet

145
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,850
security however there is not guaranteed

146
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,460
because we have some unfortunate

147
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:10,390
neighbors from plasm divers were still

148
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:13,359
using the network in the same way and we

149
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,849
can go see the cyber caliphate and

150
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,120
desires people are using the internet as

151
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:21,790
a freedom of propaganda we're seeing how

152
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,310
the time of recruitment is being reduced

153
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,050
from months years two months and from

154
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,490
also be exhausting our country was in

155
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,160
that house and before becoming more

156
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,890
radical and are going to Syria Iraq to

157
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,160
combating just as in 12 weeks that is

158
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:38,110
crazy we changes completely the way of

159
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,960
understanding the phenomenon and how we

160
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,220
need to come back to combat it secondly

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,169
through the internet and through that

162
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,330
propaganda they are carrying out a

163
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:50,710
message that I softly adaptable to all

164
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:52,210
audiences it's crazy then drop they

165
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,090
translate it with a different language

166
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:57,609
is the range study interested in they

167
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,909
adapted to the needs they consider they

168
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,849
may find that maybe remarkable is why

169
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,709
they have

170
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:06,169
can a yachting American franchise

171
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:09,649
varnishing even Chinese fighters the

172
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:13,789
message is so adaptable and the bite is

173
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:15,679
so big on the beta so big that many

174
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,360
people fall into casing out soon and

175
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:22,909
without ever saying a few days zaragoza

176
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:25,249
this message Phil's many people from a

177
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:28,248
philosophical point of view there's some

178
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:30,319
certainty markers searchers work in the

179
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:32,779
family in the past are now being solved

180
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,909
as some people as we can see in Paris

181
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,740
and leaving this pang unlocking a 13

182
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,899
integration we should do some criticism

183
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,060
from our side and from various the fact

184
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,009
is there on the side for different

185
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:44,719
reasons like a phoenix social dynamic

186
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:46,880
interaction with social interaction will

187
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,399
reach the interaction but in fact these

188
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,060
are recent messages his vertical section

189
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,440
is getting spread and he's becoming more

190
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,630
remarkable for many people this is

191
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,870
happening on many platforms Facebook

192
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:03,790
telegram as we saw on my media a few

193
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:07,910
days ago or even the main TV stations

194
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:11,540
let's remember the cyber attack led by

195
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:15,709
dodge where's t5 month of the french TV

196
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:19,579
station and these shows that the threat

197
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:23,329
is completely real although we need to

198
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:25,550
remember this was not a one-off cyber

199
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:30,050
attack a few days before they were

200
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:36,709
supposed to it in one of the monitors

201
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:39,140
all the news weather was the password of

202
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:42,949
the Twitter for the TV station so they

203
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:48,560
found the password and they could log in

204
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:50,420
so to sum up this first question why

205
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,750
cyberspace why do they too sating

206
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:56,360
immediacy global accessibility anonymous

207
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,779
seeing symmetry so all those services of

208
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,550
people comprise crime who has done

209
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,700
rational calculation of your options

210
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,910
will choose to use internet secondly our

211
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:13,490
dependence have grown so much there are

212
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:15,260
vulnerabilities option on top and this

213
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,570
is very suggestive for everyone who

214
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:21,970
wants to talk us and fairly any

215
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:24,320
phenomenon any device tablet or computer

216
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,750
as many colleagues may have mentioned

217
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,130
earlier are unprotected so the

218
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,410
possibility of attacking us through

219
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,220
network is extreme easy and until that

220
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:37,640
is not sorted until we have a proactive

221
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,760
attitude and we protect our security at

222
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,569
home on our mobiles and tablets will be

223
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,569
under a serious threat

224
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:52,110
the third objective is finding efficient

225
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:54,120
and effective replies and answers to

226
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,339
this phenomenon how can we combat it

227
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,890
well first of all we have a problem

228
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,600
because there is no single way for

229
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:05,819
single formula there's no magic formula

230
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:09,329
to come come back to it and to apply to

231
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:12,390
get rid of this problem right now and we

232
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:15,029
can not even start a war against aging

233
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,160
even though some well-known people keep

234
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:23,610
insisting on trying to combat this

235
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:25,500
through military media or mutually ways

236
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,180
other people have tried that before but

237
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,670
this was not a solution as it has been

238
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,310
proven so if there is no single way this

239
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,010
is not a war how can we do it and why

240
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,109
cannot we do it just with an army right

241
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,450
first of all because it is our material

242
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,940
threat with a reticular structure

243
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:45,660
there's no professional army and now

244
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,850
limited territory and fifth their nature

245
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,300
is halfway between what is real and what

246
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:53,670
is virtual so it's very difficult to

247
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,040
combat something when we don't rain now

248
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:59,790
were to attack it right now as you may

249
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:04,439
know we hearing whether of whether to

250
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,719
bomb iraq fallujah or to limit Internet

251
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,339
freedom or verify all the things well

252
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,140
this may work but the degree of

253
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,540
effectiveness and efficiency is quite

254
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:15,089
reduced mainly because we don't really

255
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,890
know where we're going to put our

256
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:21,390
attention so what we do we cannot just

257
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:24,260
not do anything that can come after is

258
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:26,939
prevented and neutralize it but how

259
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,709
first of all I also mention the

260
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,380
beginning we need to do a diagnosis

261
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:32,939
people might say well to combat it and

262
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,320
to have internal security when your

263
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,430
common sense and for common sense we

264
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,529
need a common knowledge

265
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:45,250
if everyone who is here today I'll be

266
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:47,439
informed on cybersecurity we couldn't be

267
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,210
able to protect ourselves secondly

268
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,070
there's a lack of governance who's

269
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:57,700
governing the internet who guarantee

270
00:12:51,070 --> 00:13:00,279
security whom should we ask from bounces

271
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,660
from easier and accountability on the

272
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,550
internet right now the recent which

273
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,160
creates quite a few problems also will

274
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,810
see later secondly there is no or

275
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,779
thirdly there is a lack of prevention

276
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,609
they're only reactive attitudes of a

277
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:16,899
southern France is proven alone we're

278
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:20,110
all communications the internet and all

279
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:24,640
the emails will be intercepted can you

280
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:28,450
imagine at some point the hotel will all

281
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:31,360
your letters will be opened before they

282
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:36,339
get to the recipient the reaction of

283
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:40,209
society will be a shock why are you

284
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:41,770
opening my letters or my packages that

285
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:43,810
sort of a private but if it happens on

286
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:47,069
the internet we don't care there's no

287
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,069
reaction there there's no

288
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:55,519
legal action or demand and the replies

289
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,969
there's the answer cannot be reactive

290
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:01,610
and reducing people's right to internet

291
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,399
freedom for theories and absence of

292
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:08,470
public and private collaboration there's

293
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:12,070
no teamwork by institutions private

294
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:15,160
bodies to talk a lot aren't this problem

295
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:18,850
next there are some wrong stories

296
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,469
there's some sort of Islamophobia and

297
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,750
segmental messages are not favoring at

298
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:27,290
all the solutions we may implement in

299
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,970
the future next we need to understand

300
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:33,290
that this is a global threat in a real

301
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:35,540
threat we have this kind of conferences

302
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,399
such as Cybercom 2015 in Washington

303
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,180
there're also a few initiatives we need

304
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,279
to make sure that for most people for

305
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,699
all of us that may have a little bit of

306
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,140
knowledge a little bit more knowledge

307
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,390
than our divers who need to understand

308
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:55,449
that is a real and very present threat

309
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,449
and last the diagnosis

310
00:14:55,529 --> 00:15:02,189
it's radia that the answers need to be

311
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,689
multidisciplinary multi-dimensional it's

312
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:07,019
not just about we use the Internet

313
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:10,620
freedom or getting out on the field of

314
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:13,019
bomb and certain cities is a corporation

315
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,779
for development diplomatic cooperation

316
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,910
trying to pause the confrontations

317
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:21,180
between the different ethnicities are

318
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:24,079
going to increase citizenship security

319
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,660
very one measure so with these diagnoses

320
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:31,829
we can get to this side tunics pendulum

321
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,329
which is a very simple chart yeah we're

322
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:36,149
mentioning here doesn't just mean the

323
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:38,069
people that terrorized due to the risks

324
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,620
that may exist on the internet this is

325
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:42,839
not about blocking people with fear this

326
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,480
may happen more they can take your

327
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:49,910
facebook details your bond because it

328
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:55,680
can what made you want to rise you

329
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:57,899
matera is not 0 VA or the extreme we

330
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,420
have now each site site elac in the

331
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:02,959
basic knowledge among internets in the

332
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,959
cyber security

333
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:08,220
people and population needs to be

334
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:11,969
trained and informed so these are the

335
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,010
proposals first of all believe in a

336
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:17,220
multicultural dialogue you may seem

337
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,380
naive but it's essential if we get the

338
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,290
right political will you can define

339
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,760
terrorism and we know really well and

340
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,050
clearly what we need to come back to

341
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,050
neutralize will be able to do it

342
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,050
probably the second proposal is to

343
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:33,689
criticize the short term trends of the

344
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:36,240
International Society the military

345
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:39,150
instruments are total necessary a second

346
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,950
engine short term easement but we need

347
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,050
to implement long-term instruments

348
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,870
measures for future generations of all

349
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:50,849
radicalization and to prevent people

350
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:53,040
from having an incentive to get into the

351
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,240
feel of terrorists we need to give them

352
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,430
life expectations and options to avoid

353
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,370
them from to prevent them from getting

354
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:05,879
radicalized here's a llama security

355
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:09,569
depends on my colleagues from national

356
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,080
security my size society depends on now

357
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:15,119
enables my site secure depends on my

358
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,699
level security needs take that into

359
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,689
account and we need to deal with the

360
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:25,040
deep causes of terrorism fourth

361
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,040
international law is essential

362
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,020
who may feel a bit lazy when it comes to

363
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,570
working on this however that's the

364
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,429
essential element that differentiates us

365
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,710
from the people who tried to dump

366
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,230
Harmer's a same time the network is

367
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,539
essential for us and currently all

368
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,510
critical infrastructures and giving our

369
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:46,860
common life a lot incoming a whole

370
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,539
prison life goes through the internet

371
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,459
knowing that those two elements

372
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,940
international law and the network are

373
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,549
essential for us we need to update

374
00:17:52,940 --> 00:18:00,299
international law urgently for the nude

375
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:02,279
challenges on the internet fifth so

376
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:08,158
saying you early on the beginning the

377
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:11,149
idea of the messages and following

378
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:14,120
searching advertising or certain biased

379
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:16,860
news messages we need to eliminate

380
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,799
concepts such as the war against

381
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:22,860
terrorism or Islamic terrorism because

382
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:24,720
they limit our success probabilities and

383
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,740
we need to understand that not everyone

384
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,210
may understand how cybersecurity you

385
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,580
works we need to explain it and you will

386
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:36,630
work I'm sure we need to be responsible

387
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:39,810
with language and information gave six

388
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,610
media mass media

389
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,370
these are freedom of expression of

390
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:46,679
course but also with responsibility

391
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:49,500
trying to find to get an informed and

392
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,230
trained society otherwise we'll get this

393
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,110
scheme which is the over information the

394
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,660
leads to lack of information at a time

395
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,510
of bias perspectives and that that leads

396
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,000
to a radical section from us media from

397
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:09,330
internet from paper medium need to work

398
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,130
affairs to sum up these proposals our

399
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,439
six-party talks about a multicultural

400
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,060
dialogue or in Pacific intervention

401
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,900
developing international law

402
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:21,330
international cooperation cyberspace

403
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,770
police collaboration at public and

404
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,889
private levels in a mutual

405
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,870
interventionism contention resource for

406
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,150
mostly we need to deal with intelligence

407
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,669
and cyberspace we need to give this a

408
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,960
lot more importance and if you are here

409
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,610
you probably know about this until

410
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,900
recently Spain didn't have a

411
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:42,918
cybersecurity strategy internet was part

412
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:47,989
of the work of four people

413
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:51,230
who thought we were weird and eventually

414
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:54,169
we have proven the sick cyber security

415
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,090
in the lack of it effects everyone on

416
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:58,700
the net so we need to demand and get

417
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:02,539
involved in these topics therefore

418
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:06,230
before a finish so that we can create a

419
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:08,509
little debate which be very interesting

420
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,639
to change our opinions on this we need

421
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:16,539
to reflect a little bit and i invite you

422
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:20,209
to think on the degree of importance the

423
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:25,090
degree of influence we may have in this

424
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,090
topic and i like to invite you

425
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:33,170
to question your comfort bubbles and

426
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:35,510
comfort zones that we are living because

427
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,400
we have a big influence on the

428
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:40,460
international scenario in the National

429
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,470
even local profit in scenarios if we

430
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,000
take some security seriously with three

431
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,680
or four measures are our colleagues

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,750
mentioned earlier and other workshops

433
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:52,730
living in the main auditorium is very

434
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:56,570
easy to get protected are the private

435
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:59,570
and public levels that means getting out

436
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:03,679
of our comfort zone and questioning our

437
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:05,149
world if you want to do war on the seeds

438
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,580
of terrorism you need to start with

439
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,730
ourselves be more responsible with our

440
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,830
own security in that way it is very

441
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,570
likely that we're all together we'll be

442
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,060
able to create an effective response

443
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:20,179
against terrorism and it's increasing

444
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:23,300
role on the internet so which could be

445
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:27,980
different missions I don't like to leave

446
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:34,040
open for you so that we all get our

447
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:38,960
conclusions jihadism tudo certo is real

448
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:41,780
and citizen ship collaboration is needed

449
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,000
as well as a cyber security culture my

450
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,790
citizens to work on planes we need to

451
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,940
work at a glove on a global scale it's

452
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:52,940
useless that out of 100 people here only

453
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,410
to know about cybersecurity and only

454
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,880
three get involved in this we need to

455
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,400
explain this to people to make it easy

456
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,020
and understandable and give them the

457
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,480
appropriate instruments and informations

458
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,610
are people from home may guarantee their

459
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,610
security on the email their bank

460
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:10,969
accounts the social networks it's a

461
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:12,740
citizen good citizenship matter so that

462
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,320
we can learn from each other and of

463
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,490
course we need to have proactive

464
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,929
strategies instead of reactive and

465
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,180
respectively strategy I think that we

466
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,310
all may week otherwise it'd be a

467
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,170
pleasure to debate it but I think it's

468
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,230
common sense what's the point of not

469
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,600
doing anything and

470
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,720
when we were tabbed physically such as

471
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,780
in battle on Wall 11m March 11 in Madrid

472
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,630
or the internet whenever they are or

473
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,460
destroy the website of the minister of

474
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,679
defense or private company dooney and

475
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,090
wait for that to happen don't think it

476
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,690
will be better to have a Pilate was

477
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:49,350
naughty and to anticipate that the cost

478
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:51,000
of fixing and making our citizens

479
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,760
feeling it feels like you after a

480
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,559
cyberattack is massive for preventing it

481
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,570
has a lower cost and besides it was

482
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:03,559
restrictive word we see how now we're

483
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:09,360
proving certain laws the just favor

484
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:11,549
restriction and we're limiting our

485
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,909
freedom will now network we need to

486
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:17,190
combat that unfortunately if we have

487
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:19,110
last video on the internet that will not

488
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:23,900
guarantee that we are more secure until

489
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:27,889
we understand that premise and we demand

490
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,890
positively not point

491
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,270
we will be a problematic situation right

492
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,760
I want you to make this presentation

493
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,350
shorting ideas to generate the debate I

494
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,580
didn't want to get technical details

495
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:43,320
otherwise these people families and

496
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,780
young people who may not have a conic

497
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,389
technical knowledge on this may not

498
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:51,510
understand it so I hope that we dealt

499
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,130
with some important issues I'm willing

500
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:59,850
to help you with anything you may need

501
00:23:53,130 --> 00:24:03,170
and I'm willing to answer anything any

502
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:03,169
questions you may have thank you

503
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,929
that's it

504
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,970
why do I but I thought we have I got

505
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:22,730
thinking I really like the word is

506
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:26,720
racing as a speech you guys and I think

507
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:29,870
that any citizen of the world needs to

508
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:33,760
be aware all right thing is a terrorist

509
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,760
marked is a provocation art

510
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,980
unfortunately advantage is that from the

511
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,020
hackers community or within the cyber

512
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,850
security community community and

513
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,629
professionals is the time to

514
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:50,600
decriminalize the hackers so that the

515
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:53,510
public bodies such as the ministry's the

516
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,659
home offices and CB and others give us

517
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,660
the opportunity

518
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:06,189
without legal friend how doing things

519
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:08,499
may be illegal those great hackers are

520
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,639
very necessary for the community may do

521
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:15,539
their bit in these defense I don't know

522
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:18,580
whether there are any initiatives

523
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:20,289
they're already go along these lines but

524
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,949
I think it's a very good way of cleaning

525
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:26,739
the hackers image in availing a little

526
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:31,239
talent to have here in Spain well thank

527
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:33,729
you very much for that comment i jolly

528
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:36,029
real with you actually from the

529
00:25:33,729 --> 00:25:38,889
beginning to the end one hundred percent

530
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:42,339
as you well said the figure of the

531
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:44,589
hacker has been criminalized for the

532
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:47,918
time hackers came up he's like the bad

533
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:51,789
guy in the film why I think it's a blame

534
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,249
of the prayers that word sounds a lot if

535
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:56,408
he's associated to something bad is why

536
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:58,749
we talk about media we need to work them

537
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:00,909
out with media sometimes if message

538
00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:03,729
being giving is not doesn't have one

539
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:05,799
intention is not filtered enough they

540
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:07,500
mainly just like my consolations of

541
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:10,320
people

542
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,120
who work on the internet are weird

543
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,480
people that we don't need to relate to

544
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,370
because they are evil thing is essential

545
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:23,610
to understand that to understand the

546
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:26,610
people who do this work may help I may

547
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:29,100
do their bit to guarantee personal

548
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,500
security of the site International Sign

549
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,959
ciety that's essentially we should have

550
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:38,160
more initiatives for example an example

551
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,340
of that is chip alone so I can i only

552
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,690
have praised words from him he

553
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,470
collaborates with the authorities but

554
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,850
just he and three or four other people

555
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,570
from here and other institutions which

556
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,800
we should invite the national and

557
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,560
governmental bodies to open their doors

558
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,800
to the people who do this for a living

559
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:02,669
but I insist the problem here they clog

560
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:07,440
right with his course for the welfare of

561
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:13,050
citizenship independently do club right

562
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:15,780
you may need to skip some laws and he

563
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:19,530
some people are real on our scale of

564
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:23,310
this so there should be an initiative

565
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:26,190
from the Home Office to create a guy's a

566
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,110
gateway for pooja club right it looks

567
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,840
like anonymous are good now because I

568
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,280
declare the war to dodge in spring of

569
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,850
years ago they got a few people that

570
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,620
they said were from anonymous and from

571
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,149
the process dismantle the whole thing

572
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,669
I'm not going that the anonymous people

573
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:45,440
are good the dodge people are bad but

574
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:49,290
the many professionals in cyber security

575
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,900
that can do their bit he's our training

576
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:55,110
please Menard that may take years for

577
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,780
them to get to that knowledge and do the

578
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:01,020
work that the professionals we will have

579
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:03,840
can do now excuse me used to comment on

580
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,279
that because you mentioned you see bit

581
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,519
well I work for a CB

582
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:11,950
and there are some lines in cooperation

583
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,399
with it said forces I cannot tell you

584
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:17,349
about them they're not public not this

585
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:20,049
close with it there are action lines and

586
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:22,570
citizens can cooperate with the state

587
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:24,668
and security forces who are websites if

588
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,039
you have access to the web sites both in

589
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:29,200
action police and civil guard you can

590
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,580
spread your knowledge see how you can

591
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,379
collaborate in we're collaborating with

592
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,468
people for them 12 and there are

593
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:38,320
agreements because in Cebu we're forced

594
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:40,029
to the mini to Department of me mu G

595
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,379
industry and tourism and we have

596
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:43,950
agreements with the Home Office to deal

597
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:47,109
with it there are public and private

598
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:50,529
collaborations in public public

599
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:52,689
collaborations and let's remember that

600
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:54,999
these people are acting and taking

601
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:59,349
measures I know that and I'm sure you're

602
00:28:54,999 --> 00:29:02,710
doing great but I have a proposal to

603
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:06,779
archer those initiatives that in CB gets

604
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:10,210
in touch with the ask who is calm

605
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:14,349
organizers and gets in touch with

606
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:18,039
attackers well in severe sponsor some of

607
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:20,529
these calm meetings but without but we

608
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:21,940
should fight against the knowledge but

609
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:23,469
that's not responsibility of this

610
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:26,529
flavortown is the responsibility of the

611
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:29,259
security inside forces and dots or they

612
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:32,080
work we don't have the responsibility no

613
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:35,019
you nor I we can collaborate if a threat

614
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,218
is identified and a locked in the best

615
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:39,330
way possible but it's not our

616
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:39,330
responsibility to do so

617
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:46,330
well it is true as a colleague or sign

618
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:49,539
the fact that we are here in peace

619
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:56,490
conference means that things are getting

620
00:29:49,539 --> 00:30:00,850
ahead and this umbrella is getting

621
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:03,580
spread is growing there is a private car

622
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,709
today it's a pretty sensitive issue but

623
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,418
I think we can keep increasing it and we

624
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:10,659
can keep creating these initiatives just

625
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:14,490
like we create these conferences as our

626
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:14,490
colleagues are we can create a system

627
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,510
well we can create networking

628
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:31,000
initiatives that would mark a big

629
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,530
difference in these points Tricia can

630
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,870
you mean yes well I just like to contact

631
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:38,020
to let you for your presentation and I

632
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:40,780
would like to ask or just for thing to

633
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,840
talk to us about North Korea and also

634
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:47,460
the communication and how communications

635
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,809
are hacked in on the high seas and

636
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,220
whether people collaborate all the

637
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:53,320
people that collaborate with the police

638
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:56,530
what degree of protection do they

639
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,020
receive the subsequent anonymity and

640
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:02,580
things like that and one last one let me

641
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:06,370
see the mentality of the radical

642
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:10,210
individuals is really tough one there

643
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:12,428
you know they go after everybody and the

644
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,289
hackers that we have around us do you

645
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:17,080
really think that they can fight against

646
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:19,270
that kind of life force you know this

647
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,658
really kind of conviction that they have

648
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:26,110
and that you know that doesn't seem to

649
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:30,880
make sense to mr. many of us okay first

650
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:33,129
of all North Korea well if anybody has

651
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,929
information about that well I would you

652
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:39,880
know happy in it be I would be a great

653
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,190
admirer of this because we know we have

654
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,850
hardly any information we just drops of

655
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:49,169
information that we can manage to get we

656
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,168
can talk about verified information

657
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:55,809
paranoid state and their leader I think

658
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,280
well you know if you understand what I'm

659
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:00,730
trying to say he seems a very pleasant

660
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,309
person he comes out and talks about

661
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:06,280
having wonderful nuclear armaments that

662
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:10,470
could blow us all up but they have seven

663
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:13,690
a cybernetic mmm force or power which

664
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,340
not even Obama has so I mean well to

665
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:20,290
what degree attend with this is just as

666
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:22,389
a kind of dissuasive tactic or to gain

667
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,590
importance on an international scenario

668
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,059
but I mean they don't even play on the

669
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,889
international scene you know they stay

670
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,780
within their geographical region his

671
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,169
strange so I could give my opinion well

672
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:34,720
i would say that country makes me feel

673
00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:36,460
uncertain and uncertainty or something

674
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,380
that i think is a bad sign I don't feel

675
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,510
comfortable with that because if you're

676
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,010
uncertain it means you don't know how to

677
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:44,590
react you don't have they're going to

678
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,510
act or you're not sure how they may

679
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,889
respond to how we could respond so

680
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,110
that's an important issue we have to

681
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,750
focus on career what can we do with

682
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:55,928
North Korea I mean that's another

683
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:59,020
interesting question they don't have

684
00:32:55,929 --> 00:33:00,940
external diplomats they can't visit the

685
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,740
state we can't talk to them and there's

686
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,320
no interest in on their part of

687
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:08,020
collaborating with them so it's a

688
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,428
strange element which floats there you

689
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:15,160
know in the international scene it's

690
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:17,410
swollen oh he talks a lot about their

691
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,360
power and their potential but we can't

692
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,620
see anything but that doesn't mean we

693
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,840
don't need to focus on it because well

694
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,699
when we're not expecting it he we could

695
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:30,490
have a problem have an issue there and

696
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:34,570
they could lash out but

697
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:36,160
here we have experts in international

698
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:41,800
affairs you may be able to tell us more

699
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:45,010
it's complex for me it's a kind of fuzzy

700
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,178
area but danger well it could be

701
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,320
considered dangerous just because we

702
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:50,110
don't know what they can do on what they

703
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:53,189
are going to do second question you talk

704
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,189
what was it the second question

705
00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:03,830
okay the people that collaborate with

706
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:06,919
the security forces yeah they privacy is

707
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:10,250
in short I mean there's no manual which

708
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:12,590
lays out the guarantees you can't when

709
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:15,290
for example if you collaborate and it

710
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:17,419
just if we say I'm going to give you a

711
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,739
certain percentage of information we're

712
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:21,168
going to give you a certain equivalent

713
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:22,908
level of privacy or protection I mean it

714
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:23,989
would depend on the case obviously the

715
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:26,149
information that an individual person

716
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:28,759
may have could be very interesting could

717
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:31,549
be very powerful then I would imagine

718
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,190
well well what you have to do is turn

719
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,840
and go to the authorities and give them

720
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,429
the information that you have I mean

721
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,899
there are a lot of researchers now

722
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:44,210
without belonging to the police force or

723
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:46,040
the god no civil guard they are do they

724
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:48,440
are carrying out social research and

725
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,960
what they do is they contact the contact

726
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,520
cyber terrorists and you they these

727
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,949
people that are looking to capture young

728
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,680
girls and boys that information that

729
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:59,089
they can have outside the law not

730
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,950
because they're doing strange things but

731
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,080
because they don't form part of the

732
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,779
police forces or the security forces

733
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,230
that can be of great interest and it's

734
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:11,480
tough but nobody's asked them to do that

735
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:13,040
so and they're not going to ask you

736
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,130
they're not going to offer you anything

737
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,190
more than a certain degree of guarantee

738
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:22,040
of privacy this is again a rather

739
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:24,470
obscure and confused area because it's a

740
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,610
very sensitive area and the third

741
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,609
question what was it

742
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,579
they have their mentality is that they

743
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:40,848
you know they there everybody that their

744
00:35:36,579 --> 00:35:42,049
their their target is everybody well I'm

745
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:44,779
going to say something that may shock

746
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:47,990
you it's very important to show this to

747
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:50,990
people make people understand this so

748
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:56,859
when before I said I talked about the

749
00:35:50,990 --> 00:36:01,549
idea well like I said at a conference

750
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:03,980
somebody once said that some people that

751
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:05,779
get into terrorism are not alino

752
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:08,509
illuminated people who've decided to

753
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:12,859
blow themselves up and oh I want to kill

754
00:36:08,509 --> 00:36:15,319
23 50 60 70 people unfortunately well

755
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:18,049
there are many psychology and psychiatry

756
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:20,599
studies to analyze who could be a

757
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:23,000
potential terrorist or not but the

758
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:25,039
greatest or the largest number of these

759
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,210
people are not psychopaths or strange

760
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,549
people these are people who perhaps

761
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:32,140
don't have any expectations in life they

762
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:36,769
live in complex very difficult complex

763
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:39,049
difficult situations and they live in a

764
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:41,990
country where there's a civil war or

765
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:43,579
ethnic conflict where the only thing

766
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:47,029
that guarantees your safety is to have a

767
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:48,380
gun or to belong to a group which will

768
00:36:47,029 --> 00:36:50,930
offer you a certain degree of stability

769
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,539
but that doesn't justify it or

770
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:57,288
legitimate it legitimize it in any way

771
00:36:53,539 --> 00:37:00,410
but those people perhaps find themselves

772
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:03,170
in this tricky moment you know that this

773
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:05,720
this point where they decide to go to

774
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,759
form part of dash Anand I ish they

775
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,308
provide them with a salary and they you

776
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:12,470
know they give them a role and

777
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:15,619
psychology and psychiatrists I have the

778
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:18,109
high have talked about this idea of the

779
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:19,900
importance of meeting people's needs and

780
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:22,250
to be recognized by the people is really

781
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,500
hugely important and these terrorist

782
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,480
groups offer that to these individuals

783
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:30,559
they make you feel like a person who has

784
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,109
an important role for a cause and they

785
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,990
we talked about that year had the he had

786
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:41,000
when

787
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:43,580
yeah when we talk about the yeehats well

788
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,350
if you really listen when I've looked or

789
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,160
study that there you have the issue of

790
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:48,290
the you had there are very few

791
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,850
references to violence I think what we

792
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:53,120
have to be careful when we use that term

793
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:56,450
but if when people find themselves at

794
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:59,150
the point of radicalization they're

795
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:01,549
going to become radicalized through the

796
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:04,670
idea of you know fighting infidels the

797
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:08,750
idea that Allah will welcome you you are

798
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:11,180
going to guarantee yourself you know the

799
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,670
idea of her death fighting for a decent

800
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,560
cause dignified course those are the

801
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,660
things that they sell but if we manage

802
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,790
to get rid of those ideas then we would

803
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,710
eliminate and the hook I mean we can't

804
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:27,290
fish without a hook or without the bait

805
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:29,240
and so people have heard about

806
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:33,080
recruitment in certain areas certain

807
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:35,149
places and places of worship and they

808
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:38,620
may still continue but if we really

809
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:41,900
cleaned up the web of those radical

810
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:43,730
messages then we would have really

811
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,380
fulfilled one of our tasks you know i'm

812
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,650
not going to become radicalized unless i

813
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,720
come across messages which and do that

814
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,610
to me and there are experts in networks

815
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,040
and media these all these people have a

816
00:38:52,610 --> 00:39:00,040
huge role so in other words if i

817
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
automatically

818
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:06,390
have no access to certain messages via

819
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:12,029
Facebook via Twitter then I will not

820
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:14,970
have an incentive to do that and it's

821
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:16,470
unpleasant to see how social networks

822
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:21,629
that are used by everybody such as

823
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:26,640
Twitter Facebook and such like how they

824
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:29,750
allow pages to be used by dash for

825
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:35,759
example dash publishes its threats its

826
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:37,620
murders its decapitations but it's a

827
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,530
reactive process you know we create a

828
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:43,529
page and it gets closed but if we talked

829
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:47,670
with experts in IT security this could

830
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:50,580
probably be prevented with sufficient it

831
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:52,170
or in advance so that people well would

832
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,420
not have this feeling of well my worth

833
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:59,300
my life is not worth anything so I'll

834
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,300
you know give it to a worthy cause

835
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:09,279
thank you hello man will congratulations

836
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:12,190
for that talk well I think it's

837
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,829
interesting to hear these kinds of

838
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:17,319
presentations to complement the more

839
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:19,690
technical workshops that talk about the

840
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:22,960
vulnerabilities of devices I would like

841
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:26,890
to imagine a scenario if here maybe in

842
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,349
5-10 years if you imagine for example in

843
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:33,609
the United Nations in the Security

844
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:37,329
Council perhaps taking decisions for

845
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:39,339
example in Spain where there's a cyber

846
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:41,880
security unit in the army and where the

847
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:45,130
attacks could be carried out on servers

848
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,710
or if we have web companies that refuse

849
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,150
to shut down certain websites for

850
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,670
example if we talk about Facebook and

851
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:54,130
such like in order to attack their

852
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:59,349
servers if they refuse to close down web

853
00:40:54,130 --> 00:41:02,490
pages that promote you know or allow

854
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:02,490
pages which promote terrorism

855
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,460
so what you're talking about to what

856
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,810
degree that would be possible the

857
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,760
Security Council Nash of the United

858
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:15,040
Nations could promote measures to

859
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,850
encourage the closure of such sites how

860
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:24,390
would you respond to that or

861
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:27,060
well well that's a well it's a difficult

862
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:32,089
balance between privacy and security

863
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:36,779
security and freedom it's a complex area

864
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:39,420
and the government's exist because we

865
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,310
exist and the Security Council exists

866
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,230
because we have decided to create it if

867
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:47,340
we choose to close websites well I mean

868
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:51,300
it's absurd it makes no sense and that

869
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,740
scenario that you've described is true

870
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,450
and unfortunately it could end up

871
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,089
happening but I think it would be very

872
00:41:54,450 --> 00:42:01,399
negative that it take to take the

873
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:04,170
decision to close websites you know it

874
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,440
this you know it's kind of too much it's

875
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,030
an exaggerated response and it wouldn't

876
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,050
it wouldn't serve a purpose you know

877
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,550
it's like saying we don't want to have

878
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,110
anybody to be able to write unwanted

879
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,840
letter so we just eliminate the postal

880
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:19,940
service what we have to do is have

881
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:22,170
really great awareness and clean up the

882
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,240
social networks it's not about closing

883
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:28,850
hotmail or closing facebook but really

884
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,850
having filters for them

885
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:36,710
I think I also want to talk about

886
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:40,640
terrorism or that's those subjects well

887
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:44,240
yes if we talk about cybersecurity we're

888
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:49,549
talking about a tackle defense when we

889
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,620
talk about cyber terrorism because then

890
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:53,900
not cyber terrorists they're terrorists

891
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,850
that we're talking about so we're

892
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:59,810
talking about the IT attacking the IT

893
00:42:55,850 --> 00:43:02,450
infrastructure of the of dash or what

894
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:05,900
are we talking about exactly well that's

895
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:09,049
a good question i would talk about two

896
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:12,890
areas of action first of all we've been

897
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:17,930
working or trying to carry out

898
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:23,089
geolocation for the places from which

899
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:26,690
the most the highest number of jihadist

900
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:29,240
messages are sent so you can analyze

901
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:31,640
blue points for example well there are a

902
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,549
high number of those kinds of messages

903
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:37,759
otherwise it would be a matter of

904
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:40,160
limiting Internet freedom no that's not

905
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,950
what it is we're talking about limiting

906
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:48,230
those messages to kind of create a kind

907
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:50,240
of umbrella or barrier so they can't go

908
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:52,970
any further so we would have protocols

909
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,109
that could identify promote these

910
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,730
activities that we could either

911
00:43:54,110 --> 00:44:00,590
eliminate them all make sure that they

912
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:02,890
did not flow into the global ocean of

913
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:06,410
Internet

914
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:10,279
we don't know what technologies they're

915
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:11,810
using in dash and I can tell you that

916
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,740
they don't have any better technology

917
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,360
they don't know anything that we don't

918
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,040
know the technology is the same and

919
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,940
often what they achieve is because

920
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,490
they're very constant are very

921
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:22,790
persistent and they managed to hit hack

922
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:26,060
the FBI or the CIA website but that

923
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:28,850
doesn't mean that they have a great

924
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:32,180
ability to develop these attacks or

925
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:34,580
worms or whatever we can't prevent them

926
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,140
from buying a computer and to receive

927
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,450
training so what we have to do is

928
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:42,049
improve our internet critical instruct

929
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:44,600
infrastructure on internet and there are

930
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:47,420
a lot of people who are starting to say

931
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:49,430
that it would be good to use by a

932
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,140
recognition so that all of the

933
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:54,319
international infrastructures devoted to

934
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:59,240
cybersecurity were to use the

935
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:00,440
identification using the retina and

936
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,549
suchlike which is interesting but I

937
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,920
think that's a solution I think what we

938
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:05,990
have to do is guarantee that our systems

939
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,920
are cyber resilient so when I receive a

940
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:11,720
cyber attack we have to be able to adapt

941
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,480
to it as quickly as possible and that's

942
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:17,750
by investing a lot of money time and

943
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,190
effort and to improving our systems and

944
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,530
probably if you invent improve your

945
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:25,060
system the ability of others to attack

946
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,060
you will be drastically reduced

947
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,760
okay well that's it if you don't have

948
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,730
anything else to say then we can

949
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:39,960
consider that why not ask included if

950
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,480
you have anything you wish to discuss

951
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,140
with me I'd be delighted so that's great

952
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,140
thank you very much
