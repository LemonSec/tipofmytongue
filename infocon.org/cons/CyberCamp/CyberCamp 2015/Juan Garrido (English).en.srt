the governor's house wat a bit of food

name now with name as auditing your

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:39,530
Active Directory let's talk about the

26
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:42,869
active directory services so many topics

27
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,479
this is the main topic we're going to

28
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,090
see and develop and break down what is

29
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,759
an active directory as of today the type

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,799
of architecture the lifecycle of an

31
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,140
intrusion let's attack an attack an

32
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,360
antagonist hair and the rich sound

33
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:04,290
conclusions it's very simple an active

34
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:08,068
directory he is how can explain to you

35
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:12,780
the company when a company

36
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:16,469
oops from being small to mid-size when

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,200
we took 12 25 employees in this middle

38
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:21,900
sized scattering as a general rule there

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,230
is no problem at all because they don't

40
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,170
have to match infrastructure to be the

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,048
burn ruled a sub today with the on

42
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:36,059
cloud-based service you can organize

43
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:40,019
your company this way when you're moving

44
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,540
from the million size the big company

45
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:45,900
with big infrastructure you need to

46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,730
govern this infrastructure from middle

47
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,209
points and external points these

48
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,768
services generate a logical structure

49
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,689
with all the elements we're going to

50
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:59,040
have over there and they're going to

51
00:02:54,689 --> 00:03:02,280
classify it a structure sort it out on a

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,879
specific place in a structure way I will

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,650
give a basic example when we go into

54
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:12,048
company when we join a company for the

55
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:15,689
first time they will give you a phone

56
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:18,299
then we'll given a printer a laptop and

57
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:21,989
access to the today's so all this

58
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:23,840
information has to be a structure in in

59
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,150
such a way that makes sense because

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,269
let's imagine in case we are leaving the

61
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:34,349
company you are taking my laptop or my

62
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:36,419
phone handset or whatever I need to

63
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:41,790
organize information so this service

64
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:44,250
comes into play here when you took a

65
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,849
burn this service inside the company so

66
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,579
in here we are going to have some

67
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:52,798
policies with which we are going to you

68
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,719
find what kind of access these people

69
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,519
are going to have how this human is

70
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,329
going to interact with this machine what

71
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,979
kind of privileges and issues he's going

72
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,569
to apply for this purpose we have some

73
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:07,319
rules and regulations within this

74
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:12,399
service in order to govern and rule this

75
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:18,329
company troubling in the very end

76
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,329
in the very end of my presentation is

77
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:30,340
what we can see on this picture batman

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:32,320
vs superman dawn of justice no no oh I

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:38,109
got it wrong no no no no where's

80
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,759
Superman going over there basically

81
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,690
speaking this will be the main

82
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,539
conclusion of my presentation so far so

83
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:52,800
good this be structure of directories

84
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:55,810
where we have a company and totally um

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,020
sorta data structure a rain structure

86
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:03,070
within place from the tree a new

87
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:06,820
organizational you need all these sites

88
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,909
over there a company dealing with the

89
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,300
services in small city will have a

90
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:17,919
totally sorta down the structure

91
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:19,900
structure we go with a mega big company

92
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,060
organized and software information and

93
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:25,419
electronic devices within the company

94
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,930
from different countries this is super

95
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:31,719
pick up they will need a biggest

96
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:36,039
structure yeah we can see formation

97
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,710
related to the administrators here we'll

98
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,510
get these administrative users with

99
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:43,299
these machines and pieces working on

100
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,780
lesson I am more things because it's the

101
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,389
same test environment put the telephone

102
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,940
that printer with all of it was everyone

103
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:55,360
we're going to go burn and roll all the

104
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:59,409
students so in remote mode we can

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,340
eliminate all data for when gray is a

106
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:06,659
sack out of the company when somebody

107
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,789
lost to smaller form we can cancel it

108
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:12,310
but not having that the company's data

109
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,289
and provided with a new mobile phone

110
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:19,530
we're going to manage it with this kind

111
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:19,530
of services so far so good

112
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,660
I

113
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:38,280
okayama control Emma okay Collin pay all

114
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,379
right we have a problem here the problem

115
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,508
appears when we start to integrate

116
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:47,370
services from one place to another we

117
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:50,460
have them and arrange the structure but

118
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:53,250
in general most of the companies want

119
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,068
you will need to integrate the party

120
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:59,310
services when they do so and when they

121
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:01,590
buy third party services then the third

122
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,539
party says okay I would interpret with

123
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,429
your infrastructure I don't need to

124
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,979
create users because i have already done

125
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,169
that i under need to manage machines

126
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:12,840
because you are ready managing them with

127
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:15,210
these divine and then all that is

128
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,520
integrated in this service and what

129
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:20,698
happens that this service is one of the

130
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,729
least audited services seeing company

131
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:29,099
often databases websites or any other

132
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:31,650
type of services voice IP is more often

133
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:34,800
than not who did it but this is the

134
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,198
basic service were nearly everything

135
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,750
goes through all the infrastructure

136
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:44,340
groceries and as I said leave very

137
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:48,569
little audited service because it is

138
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:52,400
belongs to the IT infrastructure and

139
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:58,050
this is a perfect target for attackers

140
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:03,479
and actually most of the attacks that we

141
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:06,710
may have seen on TV have been carried

142
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:10,050
out through a service of these

143
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,620
characteristics why is that so because

144
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,180
here will find information about

145
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,729
relevant people in the company so these

146
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:27,620
are some of the pieces of news that are

147
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:27,620
gathered on the internet china china

148
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:40,110
so this is a piece of news when one of

149
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:43,228
the account of one of the administrator

150
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:46,170
was located was found they preached it

151
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:50,280
and then they are chin to the

152
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:55,319
organization when someone breaks into

153
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:59,579
the system the thing is that the system

154
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:03,480
that is person finds is arranged is in

155
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:06,270
an orderly manner so if that person

156
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,270
wants to attack the person that has

157
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:12,900
money in the company this person will be

158
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:15,560
very easily located so this is one of

159
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,630
the problems arising from not

160
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,000
strengthening this type of service

161
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,250
another problem that we may have could

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,890
be this one okay because sometimes to go

163
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,020
and say all the hackers that bridge into

164
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:31,110
the system they are the smartest guys in

165
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:34,770
the world so I'm sure that you have

166
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:41,430
heard speakers saying that most so many

167
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:44,520
cases well hacking is done for a very

168
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:50,310
minor reason for instance we have the

169
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:55,590
Prince he looks very happy and then we

170
00:09:50,310 --> 00:10:00,300
can see these notices okay or these okay

171
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:04,680
papers on the wall with the password now

172
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:11,069
and I don't know that you have hers Isis

173
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:14,130
this year and how Isis Isis hacked in

174
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:17,100
Amman so everyone got really scared

175
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:22,260
because as I said that has just hacked

176
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:25,050
the TV so if we are now realistic handin

177
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,920
if we analyze what happened when that

178
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,079
happened we found we will find that

179
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,449
there was

180
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,440
journalists that was being interviewed

181
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,780
and then all the papers that we can see

182
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:43,340
behind him adjust the password to access

183
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:48,439
to websites so at the end of the day the

184
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:50,720
person the attacker just does sup that

185
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,690
does some research and that's it that's

186
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,570
as much as he needs to do so this is

187
00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:00,440
like interesting as well so these men

188
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:02,810
are gay and noticed the password behind

189
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,510
him and all these photographs are

190
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:10,280
published that POSIX and internet and

191
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:12,170
then we'll have this super bowl so the

192
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,079
Americans they spend lots of money in

193
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,030
that and notice the password the thing

194
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,870
is that there will always be a person

195
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:25,459
behind the camera so okay look there is

196
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:27,110
a person over there recording these my

197
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,350
presentation there will always be

198
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:34,430
someone making a video okay these ladies

199
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:37,820
also doing a video or taking a picture

200
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:40,400
so therefore we'll have a big problem so

201
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,850
we have to strengthen this type of

202
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:49,100
services and whatever a credential

203
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:52,670
juicers powers are just reached we will

204
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,730
go into a phase phase of auditing so

205
00:11:52,670 --> 00:12:04,160
this now we will be on the left of the

206
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:06,480
screen so that's the start so that's the

207
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,310
start

208
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:15,220
and here we will look for credentials

209
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:17,260
then and intrusion will follow and then

210
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,020
by the time there is an intrusion will

211
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,140
have to move internally will have to

212
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:24,870
understand the internal infrastructure

213
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:29,650
why this service has been placed here

214
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:31,870
what is the value of that user etc but

215
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:35,470
we are already inside again we will just

216
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:39,990
stick to the first part okay which is

217
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:43,930
what piece of greatest interest to us

218
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:47,920
and what happens here I could explain

219
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:50,979
that graphically when an attacker will

220
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,599
look on the internet who as much

221
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,270
information as possible about the

222
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:01,090
company by the time they gathered that

223
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:04,990
information this taka will attack as

224
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:07,060
much as possible so that anyone falls in

225
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,910
the trap so that he can gather

226
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,310
information about users when that

227
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:14,500
information is gathered the attacker

228
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:18,579
will continue to attack an attack an

229
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:21,970
attack up until he find one of the

230
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:25,020
equipment or an intuition that would

231
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:28,570
allow him to have full visibility

232
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:32,079
against one of the central servers which

233
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:34,450
is the server that shouts on top so if

234
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,630
that type of service is accessed we are

235
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,670
in deep trouble because the attacker

236
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:43,210
will have full access of the

237
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:53,920
organization and I repeat in an orderly

238
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:57,900
manner and now we go into welcome to my

239
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,839
work route so now we want to audit the

240
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:05,680
governance house so this type of

241
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,500
services has also other services that

242
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,680
are listening through a number of ports

243
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,990
and then

244
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,719
the attacker will have to discover this

245
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:21,250
type of services and try to breach any

246
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:26,330
of them so displaced on DNS is and

247
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:31,550
architectures and we will go right away

248
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:36,020
to the source I'm just going to do a

249
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:45,170
small test so 20 more minutes for my

250
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:49,310
presentation so hands instead of using

251
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:57,560
my machine for that I'll go right away

252
00:14:49,310 --> 00:15:06,339
to chardon I'm sure that you heard about

253
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:13,880
shot and these days shadden is a website

254
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:16,279
with a cat compiling nearly all the

255
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,790
services that are in operation on the

256
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:22,459
internet so we get both passed

257
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:25,189
information and about present

258
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:29,569
information and that information will

259
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:32,029
help us carry out our auditing and well

260
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,940
the attackers would also use these very

261
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:39,580
same services to find information so for

262
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,580
us to find active directory services

263
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,170
if we know that that is being listened

264
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:52,980
through that port the porter i just

265
00:15:47,170 --> 00:16:03,339
typed in port 389 Shannon tells me than

266
00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:05,889
225 540 results ah found so if there is

267
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:08,680
anyone in here against the Americans I'm

268
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:16,689
not against the Americans I love coca

269
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:21,099
cola myself here you can go right away

270
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:30,910
to the US and in the US the tell us that

271
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:40,439
the 96,000 bags if you go to Spain we

272
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:43,089
will have 1900 / 1900 so that is to say

273
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:47,050
website start half tea service that I

274
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:55,629
say at the street level meaning on the

275
00:16:47,050 --> 00:17:02,050
internet again if we go right away to

276
00:16:55,629 --> 00:17:06,899
the US and we go to government sites we

277
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:15,490
will find 78 of them we have

278
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:21,119
telecommunications services connect cut

279
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:21,120
state charter communications

280
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:37,130
so a list of sites so I looked into some

281
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:46,130
of these websites and I found a very

282
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:47,660
interesting one let me show it to you so

283
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:58,160
I was not sure what they will have an

284
00:17:47,660 --> 00:18:04,070
internet connection or not and ok see

285
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:11,210
you Oh club okay okay have assuming

286
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:18,639
because the video is not working okay

287
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:25,070
you can see it better now this is an up

288
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:28,430
I'd up I know that there are police

289
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:32,840
forces here and I know that it will take

290
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:35,570
some time for the Americans to report on

291
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,610
this ok so we are talking about the

292
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:41,530
report of Homeland Security that is to

293
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,530
say the White House so

294
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:53,929
notice that there is nothing here and

295
00:18:48,860 --> 00:19:07,490
then you go and say how come are you

296
00:18:53,929 --> 00:19:13,520
logging here well like haka no password

297
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:26,779
no nothing but fur but you need a

298
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:30,649
password for the password for and now

299
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:36,559
we'll go right away so the person who's

300
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:45,529
got money and that is the Department of

301
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:48,360
the Treasury ok we just log on there so

302
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:52,610
we see the 80s here

303
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:56,129
it is what one of the big US Department

304
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:58,169
then also the tobacco and tax and trade

305
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:08,880
Boudreaux they also have lots of money

306
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:11,460
and right away we will go through the

307
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:21,830
print okay those who print the

308
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:27,200
petrodollars okay if we just love again

309
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:29,790
so people have devices and people

310
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:35,720
classified in this folder so if we look

311
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,720
for this stuff how many people are there

312
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:52,320
2897 people working in the print if we

313
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:57,980
click on some of them we would get

314
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:02,040
information such as his name family name

315
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:08,370
country called email the bum about the

316
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:11,000
work number of that department serial

317
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,000
number

318
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:24,740
well they have just included a serial

319
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:28,490
number and then the users certificate

320
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,940
and that certificate we have this person

321
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:35,240
to authenticate himself to do things

322
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:44,600
remotely etc if we want to go beyond

323
00:21:35,240 --> 00:22:00,470
that we can just copy the name open the

324
00:21:44,600 --> 00:22:02,860
internet who to LinkedIn so that you

325
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:06,860
don't linkedin is good for your ego

326
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:11,449
actually I called myself great emperor

327
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:21,529
on the in on linkedin okay I notice he's

328
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:25,090
the CEO ok he is Michael wash okay

329
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:25,090
because we have access to the users

330
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,590
why

331
00:22:51,970 --> 00:23:06,260
okay that's him Michael wash okay so by

332
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,090
the time we will do the search okay so

333
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,399
we will have his email address the

334
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:23,139
department where he works the ID he's

335
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:26,899
postal code as well as his serial number

336
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:30,070
which is the same as the uid number okay

337
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:34,340
so we have already found information

338
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:37,700
information which is in good order okay

339
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:51,260
i will close this screen okay and i will

340
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:54,380
stop it there so as you will see if that

341
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,840
is not properly configured that will

342
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,330
allow me to access those services only

343
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:02,720
with a reading privilege but i can do

344
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:06,590
very many things with that privilege so

345
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,960
here we are no we haven't seen all the

346
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,490
information that is actually stored in

347
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,070
this site that will give information

348
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,950
about the use of the equipment service

349
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:17,889
of a printer of an organizational unit

350
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:21,730
and all those things have to be audited

351
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:21,729
let me give you one more example

352
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:40,440
alright so when you set up a service of

353
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,120
these kinds imagine like a huge company

354
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,810
with thousands and thousands of

355
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,780
apologies and when you have to change

356
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:52,169
the password of all the employees is

357
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,460
just very very overwhelming and

358
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:59,130
difficult and that's actually Microsoft

359
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:03,240
but well actually microsoft bought a

360
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:06,930
company and implanted within the Active

361
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,860
Directory allowing to change many things

362
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:13,650
just easily so just allow the system

363
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,110
administrators just to do a trick and to

364
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:20,250
change the password to of four million

365
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:30,719
people in one go and what happens that

366
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:42,090
if we have a reading privilege that will

367
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:46,070
help us find the password chain as I say

368
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:53,540
the password chain in the organization

369
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:53,540
when we find it if we go to the location

370
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:20,009
and then we open the XML and notice that

371
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,350
we will have a tradition credential but

372
00:26:20,009 --> 00:26:26,100
this credential is encrypted but when

373
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:30,480
Microsoft bought this company how can

374
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:34,009
hell gives out the documentation for the

375
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:39,809
product so when we read that products

376
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:42,840
documents we find a paragraph that says

377
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:45,899
as follows let me find it oh I don't

378
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:54,899
have it with me well but a paragraph

379
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:59,250
says you should know that this product

380
00:26:54,899 --> 00:27:06,899
has an encrypted key and that we will

381
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:15,059
give that encrypted tricky to you so

382
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:23,539
that encryption key will let us make an

383
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:23,539
script to implement a key to decrypt it

384
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,509
to encrypt it so this is very simple a

385
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:39,238
child could do it by the time we will

386
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:46,230
have our script the only thing that we

387
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:48,600
need is to look for xml files and then

388
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:50,850
with the embedded password that we have

389
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:58,109
plans the document that we got from

390
00:27:50,850 --> 00:28:01,230
microsoft that will help us get the key

391
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:03,629
so if the past one having changed to

392
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:07,289
four thousand users we will be able to

393
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:12,330
gain access to 4000 password very easily

394
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:14,639
so but don't use that pathway okay there

395
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:17,428
are many other ways to do so but if you

396
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:20,248
do it in this way this is very easy to

397
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:22,950
breach so you have to do things but you

398
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:27,989
have to do them rightly so nine more

399
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:30,950
minutes for my presentation I will have

400
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:30,950
to do things rightly

401
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:46,689
so last year I launched tool and i gave

402
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:49,779
i called it wider so it gives you an

403
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,700
active directory that is analyzed and

404
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:54,850
and information is presented in a

405
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,110
logical manner for and auditing because

406
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:18,668
we are talking about thousands and

407
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:23,168
thousands of objects so i have nine

408
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:25,510
minutes seven now okay this is quite a

409
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:29,049
simple tool and because i don't have

410
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:34,090
much time left so we will go right away

411
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:36,720
sin and then we will just retrieve and

412
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,720
footboards

413
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,020
these we analyzed the directory

414
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,799
directory small it has over a hundred

415
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:04,799
users and notice how fast it did it so

416
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:07,730
we go to the file so we would have all

417
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:14,340
that information in structured fashion

418
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:17,789
so it's 722 and then for instance the

419
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:28,100
password that is so before we see them

420
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:28,100
here now because i'm very lazy person

421
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:51,080
I said okay pass it on to this file so

422
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:53,659
if everything goes well so notice that

423
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:59,990
all this information is displayed in an

424
00:30:53,660 --> 00:31:06,230
excel sheet and this excel file could

425
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:09,410
also be used for our reports and this

426
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:12,770
looks beautiful and now we will have

427
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:16,250
everything that we need so for instance

428
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:21,590
if we need to send to the serial or the

429
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:25,100
person dealing with the technical

430
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:27,980
information if we need to show this

431
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,620
information in a new graphical manner we

432
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,080
will be in a position to say so we could

433
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:36,620
go and say look this is what you have in

434
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:40,460
do I mean organization you have seven

435
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:43,909
domain administrators so sure to go I

436
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,520
found a company that had 162 main

437
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:51,970
administrators in the company that has

438
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:59,629
400 employees and that is a problem and

439
00:31:51,970 --> 00:32:08,510
well that's all so conclusions and

440
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:11,000
learnings and I'm finishing a good

441
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:13,430
security plan can never be outsourced

442
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,520
one hundred percent we always have to

443
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:19,280
keep part of it in our company will have

444
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,500
to continue that into the life cycle of

445
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,240
your company and at the end of the day

446
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:28,180
you should train to employees because

447
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,180
they are the ones that will use it and

448
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:37,620
well for me okay so this is the end of

449
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:39,539
my presentation so I finished five

450
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:52,678
minutes ahead of time to have any

451
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:54,830
questions no questions oh yes there is a

452
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,830
question

453
00:32:55,299 --> 00:33:05,980
so when do logs on us and as an

454
00:33:01,539 --> 00:33:12,309
anonymous user to the US server has that

455
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:15,460
server an account for a guest account no

456
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:17,769
that's the service that is given by

457
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,409
default at the end of the day that is

458
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:23,710
using an adept service that was created

459
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:26,649
by the beach all the services based on

460
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:30,399
adapt that based on that the Linux and

461
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:33,449
the microsoft one so then each of them

462
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:38,199
okay change it accordingly so by default

463
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:40,210
you are given some authentication and

464
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,070
certification methods do you have the

465
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,440
anonymous one and the one that is

466
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:46,570
tradition based so the Microsoft you may

467
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,059
have some notice that i did it with the

468
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:51,428
US one but i didn't do it in my machine

469
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:54,158
because in my machine microsoft flight

470
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:57,419
services the windows service 2013

471
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,019
doesn't allow you to have any anonymous

472
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:01,600
authentication for these type of

473
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:05,799
services so what we've seen about the

474
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,549
u.s. is based on Lynette circuit because

475
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:13,719
I believe that allows you to do like

476
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:21,849
backwards certification okay and you can

477
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:27,969
disable it as well hello my friend any

478
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:30,250
questions well I can see that you have

479
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:32,638
lots of questions ok one more person

480
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,639
there

481
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:44,820
so the password dad is kept encrypted is

482
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:49,080
it reversible or it is just a hash yes

483
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:51,869
it is symmetrical so it is reversible it

484
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:54,480
is backward reversible and then

485
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:56,940
Microsoft publishes the key in one of

486
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,580
the document you can look it up on the

487
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,160
Internet the name of it is Group Policy

488
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:06,000
preferences so there is no domain

489
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,830
reference or anything no mattress off 20

490
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,770
palaces the services I said this is the

491
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:13,200
service and this is the key one does it

492
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,720
punish the key while Microsoft would

493
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,500
have given you the key and could have

494
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,419
given you something Oh should have who

495
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,640
he'll give you the chance to change it

496
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,340
so that each company has a different one

497
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,529
but I understand that when the key it

498
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,140
bought the service it was so difficult

499
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:33,330
for it to change the key that will have

500
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,770
to change the architecture I believe and

501
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:39,450
I believe that's the reason why they

502
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:43,950
didn't do it all right so there is

503
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:49,410
another person there all right one more

504
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:56,160
question and finish so how would you

505
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:58,470
block access to this type of password or

506
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,410
to this type of logging do you mean to

507
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:03,839
this type of malpractice okay this audit

508
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,270
would allow you to do so actually you

509
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:10,380
can download the tool on the Internet

510
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:12,420
the name of it is warrior and you that's

511
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,450
true allows you to get to the company

512
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,060
and to say look we have these are the

513
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:21,029
results of our origin this is not the

514
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:25,020
best practices that you can implement to

515
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:27,690
operate to change the password to not

516
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:30,720
use that functionality I can to change

517
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,840
the password and how do you stop that by

518
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,540
ongoing auditing these scripts is very

519
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,119
simple to run and then if you get an

520
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:41,259
alert

521
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,329
okay well dude don't you have it or

522
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:46,450
perhaps you could block it with alien

523
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:51,160
bum or with theme of the hospital aids

524
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:53,319
IPS ideas no no with alien ball at a

525
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:57,490
given point in time well that may

526
00:36:53,319 --> 00:37:00,038
generate some kind of a rule to you well

527
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:02,439
some kind of alert could be triggered

528
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:05,200
but you cannot really block it because

529
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,509
it is a functionality that is fully

530
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,660
dependent on the service it is in the

531
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:13,539
kernel of the service you cannot really

532
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:17,769
blockers how can I put it you cannot

533
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:21,369
really eliminate or stop like an

534
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:23,049
employee is well aware of that and you

535
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:24,910
can have to stop a person to do it but

536
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:27,640
you can prevent it you can just issue

537
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,558
rules to put a map in your dashboard and

538
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,769
you will have a graphical information

539
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:34,380
about that and that's as much as you can

540
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:37,720
get from it okay thank you very much

541
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:40,119
okay that's the end of it big applause

542
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,779
for him and another applause for her

543
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:42,779
she's very beautiful
