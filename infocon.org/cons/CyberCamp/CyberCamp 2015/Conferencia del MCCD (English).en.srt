2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,150
hello good morning to everyone thank you

very much to incident for having invited

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:19,340
us to take part one more year in cyber

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,560
camp we decided to prepare presentation

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:25,320
targeted at all public's okay however I

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,150
do not promise anything okay lassie I

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,050
also wanted to do exactly the same thing

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,820
have about my wife my daughter were in

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,820
the audience and they told me that they

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,920
didn't get anything right from my

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,829
presentation we will be here for 30

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,030
minutes so we will tell you first of all

14
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:49,739
what we who we are what we do and I also

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:53,750
would like to tell you how why we are in

16
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:57,780
this cyber space okay so we have the

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:01,879
lieutenant colonel he is the head of the

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:05,070
department of cooperation of the joint

19
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:14,490
commands of cyber defense of bein forces

20
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:18,839
and I am the head of the operations so

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,399
what do how many people what do they

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,689
what do harming people do at the

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,439
cyberspace well for a long long time men

24
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:32,520
have been in combat in World for

25
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:41,089
centuries for centuries we have improved

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:44,090
our arms capacity tactics we introduced

27
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,090
firearms

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,410
Chariots of combat that is to say more

29
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:56,609
and more sophisticated elements up until

30
00:01:51,410 --> 00:02:00,210
today and the situation right now as the

31
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,150
shows on the screen so all that has had

32
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:07,770
an impact on the doctrine of doctoring

33
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:10,679
of war strategy tactics etc the same has

34
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,470
happened in the second domains where the

35
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,010
words have been waged which is the sea

36
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:24,320
which is my domain in the last 40

37
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:27,690
centuries CE has been evolving so we

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:34,140
started off with rowing boats then

39
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:39,829
sailing boats then that was followed by

40
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:44,910
gas propulsion blinded vessels

41
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:47,850
techniques and technologies helped

42
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:53,280
review all the concepts all the concepts

43
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:57,030
from Naval War the same happens in the

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,799
air still will have to wait until 19th

45
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:08,299
century to have forces in the beginning

46
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:12,810
that started with aerostatic enclose

47
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:17,280
balloons later on in the 20th century we

48
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:22,290
got aircraft armed aircraft and planes

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:25,410
and at a time all the concepts of the

50
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:29,250
world were kind of rethought Andrey

51
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:34,650
approached now in the 20th century we

52
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:38,160
have to space another domain for work so

53
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:42,180
in the first decade of the 21st 20th

54
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:47,209
century the most powerful nations want

55
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,209
to increase the power that controls

56
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:58,380
and then they also acquired capacities

57
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:03,299
to neutralize as much as possible the

58
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:06,060
capacities of the enemy and now these

59
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,150
sorts of the 21st century we have the

60
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,830
cyberspace which is the setting a domain

61
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,570
which is not at all related to the

62
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:17,220
previous settings it has different

63
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:20,370
characteristics were compacts are

64
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,560
completely different from before and

65
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,070
what everything that happens in there

66
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,220
permeates has a very strong influence on

67
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,290
the other four domains and what is

68
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,230
specific and special about the

69
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,870
cyberspace domain well first and

70
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,140
foremost this is a nearly infinite

71
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,740
domain it is artificial but nearly

72
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:45,870
infinite it is a domain where the

73
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,460
boundaries and the limits a little

74
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,530
defined and very blessed so the

75
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,590
techniques and the weapons that are

76
00:04:52,530 --> 00:05:03,570
being used are specific for that domain

77
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:10,799
and only if in the sea the air and land

78
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:13,830
all the claims and the vehicles are in

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:19,350
the power of the armed forces in the

80
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:22,200
cyberspace all those weapons cyber

81
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,530
weapons are scattered meaning that

82
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:28,530
anyone could have cyber weapon and very

83
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:32,219
powerful weapon and then the same we

84
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,739
also have a wide range of actors we do

85
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,310
not only have the military that will

86
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:42,060
have many people that have the potential

87
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:46,750
to cause a damaged

88
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:49,060
very complex legal environment this is

89
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,729
so in the Civil world however it becomes

90
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:56,470
even more complicated when we try to

91
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:59,469
apply and work law to the war that is

92
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:03,370
waged in the cyberspace so we are still

93
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:06,580
starting in working on that regard this

94
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:10,560
is a domain that has an impact on every

95
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,758
single activity of governments so just

96
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,270
you can think about traffic

97
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:20,560
communication transportation energy

98
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,530
supply everything everything is nowadays

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,260
based on the civil space and supporting

100
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,960
in the seventh space and the greatest

101
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,389
conceptual change of all that is that

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,930
for the first time ever in the history

103
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:37,750
of world the heart of nation is exposed

104
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:41,979
and it is in the first line of content

105
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:45,009
come back so from the cyberspace you can

106
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:49,270
move right away you can access right

107
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:52,720
away to that heart and actually rather

108
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:57,460
than going beyond or using the

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,130
cyberspace as one more word domain well

110
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,150
so so logically speaking of

111
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,389
psychologically speaking we are living

112
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:07,198
into biospheres simultaneously we have a

113
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:10,680
physical one that we have clearly

114
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:14,669
identified with rivers boundaries

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,090
frontiers we know where our enemy is

116
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:23,560
well traditionally armed forces have

117
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:29,380
been combined but in neutralizing the

118
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:32,050
enemy just to enforce the will so as

119
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,750
rational beings we also live in a

120
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,419
logical biosphere with Eve in the worlds

121
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:41,500
of reason the worlds of ideas and we are

122
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:44,799
also beefing also playing in that field

123
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:48,510
through icons paintings with movies

124
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,060
films so if we've been building our

125
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:55,210
mindsets

126
00:07:50,060 --> 00:08:01,370
based on what we learned from TV series

127
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:04,719
films etc this is also a way of compact

128
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:08,630
nowadays and actually in the cyberspace

129
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,710
nearly all of you are concerned about

130
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:15,590
data about numbers that is to save data

131
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,989
that could be stolen from you data that

132
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:22,030
you can manage and deal with but we also

133
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:25,850
have ideas and letters in the cyberspace

134
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:28,789
literacy what the Islamic state is

135
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:32,240
currently doing it now they are using

136
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:35,419
the cyberspace to manipulate ideas to

137
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,440
disseminate their ideas to a spread them

138
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:42,500
we are not talking about numbers only

139
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:46,279
economy only they are also doing or

140
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:50,450
waging is cyber world and here we have

141
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:53,210
also ideas around and this is as

142
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,520
important or even more important than

143
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,830
what it's hot that happens with numbers

144
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,980
and actually the traditional layers of

145
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:04,820
cyberspace that we have the physical

146
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:08,180
layer that we've been acting on all the

147
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,640
time and we can also work on act on the

148
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:14,479
infrastructure but as of the fifth layer

149
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,290
everything becomes fully artificial so

150
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,230
when we act on the sea or the air we

151
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,810
know the physical laws we are subject to

152
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,680
in the cyberspace we do not only have

153
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:30,949
those physical knows but to the laws

154
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,910
that we have to find where we build the

155
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,609
infrastructure of those layers so this

156
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:44,699
time did

157
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:49,170
we r mu a mu less Joe and oh and we are

158
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:51,858
Joe and 0 at whatever so we are more and

159
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:56,790
more our avatars our avatars are

160
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:59,600
increasingly more real and because even

161
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,849
in the way we interact with each other

162
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,169
cyberspace is changing okay now we are

163
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:11,069
shaping groups we socialize move based

164
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:17,119
on our interests we are not subjected to

165
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:21,479
a consistency to the tyranny of

166
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:23,730
consistency so we have to understand all

167
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,699
that from the cyber defense not only to

168
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,649
understand the risks and threats of

169
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:30,779
cyberspace but also to understands the

170
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:36,179
understand the opportunities that

171
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:39,929
cyberspace offers so we said that we

172
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:42,449
come back in cyberspace and what are the

173
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:44,419
targets here we are we under talking

174
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:49,609
about combat units we are talking about

175
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:55,129
vessels of train planes military bases

176
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:59,519
so here we are come up fighting for

177
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:02,759
information for delaying it or from

178
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,089
taking away from the enemy so we are

179
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:09,899
also fighting the systems that supports

180
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:15,329
the exchange of that information and we

181
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:18,869
can also fight people people are one of

182
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:23,419
the most vulnerable points as we will

183
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:23,419
clearly see throughout these days

184
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,990
so what are the threats in the

185
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,870
cyberspace what are the military threats

186
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:35,089
in the cyberspace well actually they're

187
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,300
exactly the same ones that we have in

188
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:41,720
our daily lives so on the screen you

189
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,740
would not spot any term you are not

190
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,500
familiarize with i'm sure you are very

191
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:51,740
much used to them you know them from

192
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,800
cyber crime from hacking from whatever

193
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:58,699
all of them all of them are techniques

194
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,609
used by the military and that our

195
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:03,170
enemies just against us however these

196
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,889
techniques are also used by several

197
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:11,509
hackers and cyber primers therefore we

198
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:13,850
are using the same tools and taking

199
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:18,160
advantage of what well taking advantage

200
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:21,199
of the wide range of vulnerabilities

201
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,600
related to information systems and to

202
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,180
the actual information well these

203
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,260
vulnerabilities start being physical

204
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:34,420
starting off by flaws in design or by

205
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:40,010
tampering which is and ill intentions

206
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:42,529
manipulation Oh on the part of users so

207
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:45,350
we've seen tampering in well-known

208
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:48,220
brands that is to say issues regarding

209
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:51,730
programming design protocols

210
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:54,560
applications and then also

211
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:58,600
vulnerabilities associated to the blame

212
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:03,649
of the user so perhaps due to lack of

213
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:08,569
awareness or because the user of the

214
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:11,949
system is our actual enemy so the very

215
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:15,079
recent cases that will have hers in the

216
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:18,319
armed forces in the US such as what

217
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:20,620
happened with the money solder and we

218
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:23,839
have very many physical and logical

219
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,660
vulnerabilities that our enemies can tap

220
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,670
against us and that we contact against

221
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,930
our enemy

222
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:35,990
and how do we classify the offensive

223
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:39,469
operations in cyberspace well is that

224
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:45,770
enough from the most simple for the less

225
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:48,560
intrusive we starting off with digital

226
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:55,040
intelligence that is to say obtain shin

227
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:58,010
of information about the enemy that will

228
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,819
help us move forward the next step is

229
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:05,540
infiltration that is to say penetrating

230
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:09,050
penetrating the system of the enemy

231
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:12,650
there is a wide range of techniques well

232
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:15,859
one of the most typical ones could be

233
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:18,680
fishing or using an infected and drive

234
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,950
then from there we move on to the next

235
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,349
stage which is infection infecting

236
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:28,580
assistant that would allow us to carry

237
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:32,780
out the attack cyber stack attack aimed

238
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:38,620
at achieving denial of service altering

239
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:43,660
data if we older data at a large scale

240
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:47,960
it may result in significant physical

241
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:52,339
damage and could also result in physical

242
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:57,080
destruction and another very important

243
00:14:52,340 --> 00:15:00,350
technique is leaking of information that

244
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:04,510
is to say hidden channels hidden

245
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:07,250
channels to extract sensitive classified

246
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:11,030
confidential information that may be

247
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:14,930
interested in getting to fight my enemy

248
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:17,209
and here at this stage we should give

249
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,900
some context as to the role that we play

250
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:24,200
in our joint command so we are the

251
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:29,480
equivalent of in cville in the world of

252
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:32,150
industry and the Ministry of Interior

253
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,130
however that we are in the Ministry of

254
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,220
Defence we are one of the three

255
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,610
governmental sense that we have here in

256
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,279

257
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:43,399

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:24,710
this is a three and a half minute video

335
00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:13,978
you have any questions we will be very

336
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:17,729
happy to take them and what about an apt

337
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:20,389
that is to say a complex attack tax that

338
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:23,389
will have to face very frequently and

339
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:25,498
well perhaps they are the most complete

340
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:29,279
sophisticated and complex attacks

341
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:33,239
nowadays so let us explain to that in a

342
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:37,950
simple manner so we can't be victims of

343
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:41,639
those type of attacks or we could be the

344
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,440
attackers some more often than not it

345
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:49,498
starts with the introduction of a

346
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:52,229
malicious file through any of the

347
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:55,529
connections or systems in place the most

348
00:20:52,229 --> 00:21:00,209
typical way to do it is to do it through

349
00:20:55,529 --> 00:21:02,219
email or through F is in social

350
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:08,549
engineering that is to say fishing or

351
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:11,149
just USB and infected us be there for

352
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,440
the intranet of an organization is

353
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:17,339
accessed through a number of techniques

354
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,219
techniques that are will not dwell on

355
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:23,940
too so you can do like an escalation of

356
00:21:20,219 --> 00:21:27,509
privilege just to obtain the privileges

357
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,929
as administrator of the system to get

358
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:33,809
more and more information and to extract

359
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:37,109
information extracting the topology of

360
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:41,459
the red distracting vulnerabilities that

361
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:44,279
are given back to the attacker that

362
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:47,969
occurred then gets the command and

363
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:50,579
control of the system from remote

364
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:53,219
locations then specific tools are

365
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:55,469
designed to attack the specific system

366
00:21:53,219 --> 00:22:01,219
so we have the scattered system trying

367
00:21:55,469 --> 00:22:06,620
to recreate what happens with the

368
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:15,680
centrifuge for uranium enrichment in

369
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:17,360
Eden so eventually the software

370
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,300
associated with the SCADA system was

371
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,679
tampered was altered in a manner the

372
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,899
control systems were being sent out

373
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,059
saying that the system was okay was

374
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:35,570
perfectly of Rights which was not the

375
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:39,200
truth and therefore the centrifuge

376
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:42,080
increased the web's per minute and there

377
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,880
was no control as to about that speed

378
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,379
and they ended up being destroyed so

379
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,420
through the various interconnections

380
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:55,580
between systems virtually there are no

381
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:58,670
isolated system so that was very likely

382
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,590
to have a cascade effect a chain effect

383
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,690
that could have an effect on other

384
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:06,040
critical infrastructures of a region

385
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,220
nation or a state as I mentioned before

386
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:16,190
critical infrastructures such as energy

387
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:18,980
etc and well potentially chaos could be

388
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:21,290
causing nation especially vulnerable

389
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,420
czar those nations that are

390
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:29,120
technologically advanced but also our

391
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:32,960
neck nations that have not fully

392
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:36,830
developed their defense capacity and we

393
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:40,940
are amongst one of those nations so we

394
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:45,530
are not the spearhead we are not one of

395
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:49,130
the first nations that trust most on the

396
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:52,220
cyber defense that they have but we are

397
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:56,059
working really hard to correct that to

398
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:58,640
change that now how important is the

399
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:02,389
joint command of cyber defense for the

400
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:07,250
national defense well we are quite small

401
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:11,720
troop and very jeong eh we are only two

402
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:16,610
years of age well our joint commands

403
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:19,910
okay our group is young but we are not

404
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:24,169
as young okay we are very young as in

405
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:27,170
JUnit of course military's cyber defense

406
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:31,790
was not born with us we have just gotten

407
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:34,760
the baton from mother units from other

408
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,920
people before us that worked in cyber

409
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,950
defense before so we have brought

410
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:43,100
together all those capacities to work

411
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:46,490
and to operate not only at home but also

412
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:49,340
outside Spain the importance of the

413
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:53,210
cyber defense command for the Ministry

414
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:55,909
of Defense is very well illustrated if

415
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,490
you want to think about the following we

416
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:02,929
have the ministry defense has three

417
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:07,510
permanent missions one of it being the

418
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:12,280
surveillance of our territorial borders

419
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:15,290
surveillance against piracy to prevent

420
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:21,549
humanitarian problems with illegal or

421
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:21,549
legal immigration seconds we'll have

422
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:31,309
Aryan o our air defense okay so we have

423
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,010
a number of planes ready to attack

424
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:38,440
whenever needed and the third permanent

425
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:38,440
mission which works twenty-four seven

426
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:48,570
is defense of the cyberspace and this is

427
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:51,440
the mission of the joint cyber defense

428
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,820
command so we are one of the main

429
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,640
permanent missions of the Ministry of

430
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,720
Defense and one of the basic pillars of

431
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:05,370
the permanent defense that is being made

432
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:09,510
for Spain and we are the only country in

433
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:12,719
the world today that considers cyber

434
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:14,670
defense as a component command whenever

435
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,310
the recent operation whenever there is

436
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:21,270
any problem whenever an operation is

437
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:24,330
planned then the land command gets

438
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:27,780
together to provide its capacity the

439
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:30,270
same goes for see special operations as

440
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,570
well as the joint cyber defense command

441
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:35,220
so cyber defense as well as the

442
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:38,010
capacities that we have in the

443
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:42,090
cyberspace are taking into account for

444
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:46,910
any operation that is planned those to

445
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:50,040
defend the national territory or full

446
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:54,300
operations that we carry out a brush and

447
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:57,720
that we for instance for our vessels in

448
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:59,820
the high seas well the these are the

449
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:04,190
capacities that we have and that we are

450
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:08,270
developing have capacities of Defense

451
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:11,760
rotations and response defense is a

452
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:15,090
preventive defense we want to anticipate

453
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,010
events as being heard on the videos we

454
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,659
saw in the video you want to be a step

455
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:24,480
ahead of your enemy to prevent attacks a

456
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:29,160
proactive defense and non static defence

457
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,530
you cannot really we we have to do both

458
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,770
will have to defend ourselves and we

459
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:38,940
also need to be ready to come out of our

460
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:41,010
castles and to fight our enemy if needed

461
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,020
for that we need to find out what they

462
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,960
do what

463
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:47,870
they're to interact and we need a

464
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,690
capacity to support the rest of the

465
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,790
military forces in the operations by

466
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,550
using the resources available at the

467
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:58,790
cyber in space where a field of

468
00:27:55,550 --> 00:28:02,510
population scope of operation is the

469
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:04,399
whole world as Rick mentioned before we

470
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:08,960
are this is no longer a fight between

471
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:13,540
two states between two combat aircraft

472
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:17,420
now we have company individual citizens

473
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:20,450
loving groups terrorists that are also

474
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:24,050
having an impact on the defense on the

475
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:27,260
national interests and therefore with

476
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:31,310
the number a mission we have the defense

477
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:35,270
of all that and to prevent any type of

478
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:37,159
intrusion and that has made that has

479
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,620
made it one of the characteristics of

480
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,410
the cyberspace as we mentioned before so

481
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:45,800
a wide range of actors involved and for

482
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:48,740
that we designed a center for command

483
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:52,240
and control of cyber defense in that

484
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:57,890
sense that we are kind of it is kind of

485
00:28:52,240 --> 00:29:00,530
Daniel so it looks like in the film's ok

486
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:03,640
we have a planning room operations room

487
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:06,770
and from there we are monitoring the

488
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,470
networks of the Ministry of Defense and

489
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:11,389
from there we are doing real-time

490
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:13,340
monitoring of all the networks we are

491
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:16,430
talking about multiple networks we are

492
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,860
not talking about national scope we are

493
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:21,680
working with NATO with a european union

494
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,209
with other allies we have different

495
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,280
network with different degrees of

496
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,800
classifications so the information that

497
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,370
is being transferred is highly sensitive

498
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:33,710
here we are not risking or we are not

499
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:36,530
playing with the money of the taxpayer

500
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,260
but with the lives of people so

501
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,790
therefore we have developed a team to

502
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:44,150
centralize

503
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:46,220
that information and to direct all these

504
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,490
operations in corporations with our

505
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,000

507
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,200
their respective capacity in the cyber

508
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:04,340
space cooperation is a must we have it

509
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,560
clear we are going founding member of

510
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:11,659

to training people and since midway and

525
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,780
due to the current necessity of talent

526
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,470
within this market with the extra

527
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:02,889
cooperation but there is a an actor

528
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:05,210

protection is this this is what you mean

548
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,740
regarding sharing information at this

549
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:22,220
moment in time there's the specific

550
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,450
formulas of cooperation between the

551
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,340
joint cyber defense command of armed

552
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:28,890
forces incidence these foreigners are

553
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:31,500
limited we are now as studying the

554
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:35,990
possibility of counting individually on

555
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:40,020
people we are doing either through the

556
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:43,740
this part of platform in this in the

557
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:47,100
army working with civil engineers or we

558
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,020
have started as well with some students

559
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,629
we've been working with us we are

560
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:55,889
figuring out the right formula to get a

561
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:58,170
fluid flow of information we should

562
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:01,320
integrate the capabilities from

563
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:03,270
individuals within the joint offense

564
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,629
commander of the Armed phones not only

565
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:10,139
regarding the rules and standards but

566
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:12,900
also the permissions and to do work

567
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,270
within the cyber defense environment and

568
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,820
to manage critical information dealt

569
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:20,610
with a military this is a current a

570
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:23,610
current project going on but there are

571
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:28,070
no the right standards incorporation

572
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:28,070
formulas as such we are working on that

573
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:39,720
good morning I would like to know if you

574
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:44,700
now we are now on a four level of

575
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:48,120
defense do you have a fluid relationship

576
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,190
with the Autonomous Region Police Force

577
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,659
is because we are living and through a

578
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,790
delicate moment there are cell

579
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:58,580
terrorists threateners what are doing

580
00:33:53,790 --> 00:34:01,530
regarding this of course there are some

581
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:05,010
mechanisms which are triggering are

582
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:08,489
activated as the alert level some grow

583
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:11,668
and grow more and more cooperation among

584
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:14,158
the law informants groups and the Armed

585
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:17,580
Forces is contemplated through some

586
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:21,179
plans which the bull of this idea that

587
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,340
as the alert level grows and goes up the

588
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,800
greater the major that of the

589
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,500
cooperation of the armed forces is with

590
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:33,600
the rest of the law informants groups at

591
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:36,960
this moment level 4 as the at this

592
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,699
moment the law enforcement group the

593
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,379
autonomous National Police and the

594
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,330
guardianship are responsible for the

595
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:44,730
fingers for the terrace at this moment

596
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:47,219
we are working out with we the military

597
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:50,250
are we working with the law in four mins

598
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:52,609
groups to the cyberspace units from the

599
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:56,790
please the Civil Guard the numbers

600
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:58,410
please groups are not doing this but we

601
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,150
are cooperating with them as you know

602
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,270
now in the autonomous region of cattle

603
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:05,250
and there is a strong inference of Islam

604
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:09,300
is there are a lot of Islamic in

605
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:13,190
Catalonia at this moment in time we only

606
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:15,650
have another level number 4 in Catalonia

607
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:18,930
there are some mechanisms of

608
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:23,520
coordination at a government government

609
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:25,580
level in principle it the mystery of

610
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,710
defense does not have the direct

611
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,170
corresponding competency of having

612
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:34,620
conversations with autonomous regions

613
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:38,030
and local municipalities this is done

614
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:40,680
through one of specific channel channel

615
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,480
3 there is a connection between the

616
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,060
military and autonomous region

617
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,180
Lisa's but we are now supporting we only

618
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:51,509
give support we don't take the lead we

619
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:59,460
don't have the leadership now because is

620
00:35:51,510 --> 00:36:03,030
level for my name is Mel I devoted to

621
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:06,570
the trading and merchandise security am

622
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:09,119
now working on this field subject matter

623
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:13,640
you are presented to us in 2007 we had a

624
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:17,790
case we directly report to the Interpol

625
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:20,460
we had sent information supported on a

626
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,460
database and document there are some

627
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:26,450
links and linkages we were very

628
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:30,510
dangerous so our clients and customers

629
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:33,390
sent child some documents in 2007 and so

630
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:36,210
I reported to Interpol very first object

631
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:39,000
to be investigated we wear ourselves as

632
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:41,190
a company so there's a barrier I don't

633
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,800
know how to jump over these fans are

634
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:46,980
very if this dossier is negative how am

635
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,230
I going to inform report to the loin

636
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,609
forest road what is the vehicle or the

637
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:55,140
tool you are offering from a state vase

638
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:57,450
perspective to the companies and

639
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:02,368
industries corporations with a low

640
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:06,480
informants groups and especially as of

641
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:08,940
the protection data law is within the

642
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,010
legal framework and it's very restricted

643
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:15,660
for several aspects at any case our

644
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:19,619
relationship with the citizen is

645
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:24,350
normally through the channel of the cell

646
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:26,940
C ERT in charge of the relationship with

647
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:30,240
citizenships which is that the center of

648
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,240
cybersecurity the center the

649
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,549
cybersecurity should be able to answer

650
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,379
to this legal in criminal questions the

651
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:40,410
differentiation between national

652
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,640
institute of cybersecurity and the art

653
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,339
forms would be the same applicable

654
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,440
between the sibling penal in criminal

655
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,640
law and the international law on the

656
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:54,360
other side the criminal law and civil

657
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:57,330
law our competency of the fever

658
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:00,720
cybering industry now I'm working on the

659
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:02,790
the mercantile in trading area but we

660
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,189
are on the same time it has to be clear

661
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:08,460
for all of us are big commitment to us

662
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:12,750
is to protect their the Ministry of

663
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:15,300
Defense networks and systems the the

664
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:19,530
ground military do not protect the

665
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:21,630
jewelers on the streets Tirana so we do

666
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,230
not protect merge mercantile or

667
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:27,450
commercial issues there are other

668
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:30,540
organizations to do so r is of course

669
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:36,540
the European is a directive and

670
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:37,890
guidelines the oblige obliges to us that

671
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:40,290
when you have instance in your

672
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,730
organization affecting your clients and

673
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,759
customers you have to report it to the

674
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:49,860
authorities that was the point there is

675
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:51,180
like a duty of assisting others from its

676
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,180
evil viewpoint you have the obligation

677
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,750
the duty to give a system so you also

678
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:00,390
have the duty of reporting information

679
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:02,370
which sometimes can mean the collapse of

680
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:04,890
your own company by the way especially

681
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:07,170
if it's a sorry security company and

682
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:08,730
your kids have been stolen from all your

683
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,320
customers in class it's a bad thing for

684
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:19,520
your own reputation as a business

685
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:19,520
personal entrepreneur good morning

686
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:27,870
when you are responding to an attack the

687
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:30,960
legislation framework I take for granted

688
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:33,000
that you only respond to two military

689
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,970
incidence but what is the legal

690
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,730
framework to respond are you from

691
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:43,100
Galatia galician obvious I'm adulation

692
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:45,060
person bad way normally speaking

693
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,670
ninety-three percent of the instance

694
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,279
will respond our meal of military

695
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:53,310
subject matter our commitment is to

696
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:57,060
protect the networks and systems in the

697
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:59,160
military as well as those that can be

698
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,910
given to us because they affect to the

699
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:06,120
National Defense so we have like a

700
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:07,920
tentacle in this octopus that can open

701
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,460
the possibility of executive actions

702
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:16,260
regarding systems that are not literally

703
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:18,030
essentially of military nation but we we

704
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:20,700
solve incidents affecting our own

705
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:23,850
military networks as it happens in many

706
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:27,330
organizations most of the cases are

707
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:30,990
false positives or incidence triggered

708
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:34,319
from the battery use on behalf of the

709
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:39,660
users but awareness but practices rather

710
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:43,440
than exterior tax per se did I answer

711
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:47,609
you today case I'd like to clarify that

712
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,220
the great same standard regulating the

713
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:54,500
joint cyber defense command of armed

714
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:57,480
forces of lighters to conduct a

715
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:01,200
opportune proportion and legitimacy

716
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:05,340
actions as in other scope we need to

717
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,279
stick to the legal current standard

718
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:11,400
international speaking my question was

719
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,860
more specific do you want to respond to

720
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,480
a physical incident and you have to

721
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:18,690
export permission from the NATO to

722
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,860
initiate the military external action in

723
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:25,260
this case in in

724
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:29,520
inside but offensive outside Staind how

725
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:34,530
did you manage this this is a truly

726
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,870
question we should have given you 1,500

727
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,150
page and said depending on the situation

728
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:42,990
you are but when it's not the same that

729
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:45,900
the right you exert or the law

730
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:49,259
regulating and the literature and

731
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,990
conflict peaceful situation and crisis

732
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:56,520
situation sometimes an attacked from an

733
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:58,529
IP tours or against a properties of the

734
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,560
ministry defense the amount i have to

735
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,840
hand up the oil phone and have to report

736
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,610
this to the Civil Guards the the

737
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,890
national place I'll have to report it at

738
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,480
court in front of the judges in case of

739
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,089
conflicts with deal days with a

740
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,580
different process with other plans with

741
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:16,580
little forecast plans that trigger

742
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:23,250
series of actions in accordance with San

743
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,830
give importance studied in bias so

744
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:28,740
depends on many things we military don't

745
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:31,110
have to access their permission from the

746
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:34,229
nature to conduct an action the response

747
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:37,530
has to be opportune legitimate and

748
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:39,060
proportion there's has to be a temporary

749
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,460
relationship between the attack on what

750
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,799
my response is there are so many ways to

751
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,960
respond to an attack so if this has to

752
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,210
be legitimate you have to be in

753
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:53,030
accordance with the current law at the

754
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:56,580
moment can be the law of conflicting

755
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:58,410
battles or for instance vegetation

756
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:00,000
affecting one single country the cutter

757
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,060
can be in a country the serving a

758
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,100
different counting song songs and form

759
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:08,160
lastly the response with proportion

760
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,000
measure there is cut there has to be a

761
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,890
relationship between the size of damages

762
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:17,190
given by the potential attack and my

763
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:22,069
answer to counteract this is the third

764
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:24,150
play in use now oh my gosh per year

765
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,240
hello Albert turn on it I'm the

766
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:28,970
operations director from the

767
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,220
International Institute of

768
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:35,430
sophistication regarding incident

769
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:40,200
and the task within civilians and

770
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:43,410
private cabin is the set of industry is

771
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,540
operated by the ministry of in the Home

772
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:48,720
Office and the Ministry of industries

773
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,940
that helps us in case of incidents

774
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,299
within this civilian and citizens in

775
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:58,460
scope or targeting capodistrias and free

776
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:01,770
to phone number are through the cyber

777
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,349
Internet user that can report all

778
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:07,160
incidents affecting people children's

779
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:09,930
common citizens and the private sector

780
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:12,240
once you have reported the fact that in

781
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,848
my company we got this problem we

782
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:17,640
receive it we delve into that it rates a

783
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:20,340
crime behind the criminalisation acting

784
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,868
behind we report it to the law

785
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:26,369
enforcement group in fact we working

786
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:29,130
very very closely to the end they have

787
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:30,510
we have the police agents in the

788
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:34,590
National Institute of cyber security and

789
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:39,660
given it a rapidly pause as of today we

790
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:44,160
had managed in Spain over 43,000 cyber

791
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:46,140
security incidents among citizens small

792
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,598
size medium sized with companies and

793
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:51,540
critical servers to infrastructures

794
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:54,660
throw the gains our family is when we

795
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:56,940
buy things on internet with our banking

796
00:44:54,660 --> 00:45:01,170
credentials are stolen and but also

797
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:03,960
attacks against companies or citizens so

798
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:07,109
here with there is the citizens and the

799
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,230
private scope you have the third of

800
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:12,750
cyber security industry it is affecting

801
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:14,730
other networks and we have to report it

802
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,609
to the Home Office of the mission the

803
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,980
interior minister have a close link is

804
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:23,069
with the Minister of Interior and the

805
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:29,190
place aliens did I answer the decline

806
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:33,859
for your point and q Thank You Albert to

807
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:37,320
have the same that Alberto who is now a

808
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:40,290
whole person a big prominent person in

809
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,770
the surgical team environment he was

810
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:45,290
working with the military back to in

811
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:48,410
90 years he was one of the third the

812
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:53,660
best assets we got there back in time to

813
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:55,839
your scale thank you very much thank you

814
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:59,120
much for your time we're talking about

815
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:02,510
vulnerabilities menaces threads in the

816
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:05,060
cyberspace also scary so spooky me

817
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,300
aren't we well for checking I'm not

818
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:12,350
afraid I'm stay off switching on the

819
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:14,930
laptop them off for likely nuclear power

820
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:18,380
stations are we ready for so many

821
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:21,950
threads of today we are ready today but

822
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:24,620
tomorrow we are going to still needing

823
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:26,120
be ready we need to study in the future

824
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:30,680
for tomorrow because the evolves so

825
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:32,600
quickly that we need to catch up with

826
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,419
the reason of technologists the

827
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,920
attacking tech needs to be all ready to

828
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,270
take daily we have to take clear that

829
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:42,230
one hundred percent security does not

830
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:44,570
exist never will exist but never in this

831
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:52,270
environment that the issue is that are

832
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:55,040
soft today we we had our likelihood of

833
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:58,340
