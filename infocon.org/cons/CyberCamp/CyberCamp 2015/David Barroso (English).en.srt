25
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,090
fact that we should be a word of the

26
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,370
many tricks we are currently suffering

27
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,240
and getting through for being working in

28
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:24,690
cyber security after the horrible

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:27,330
attacks in Paris the world is reshaping

30
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,670
the economic and strategic model it

31
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,060
changed the confidence among countries

32
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,700
is reshaping we are living through a

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,940
changing world cyber security comes into

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,619
the big a scenario we people dealing

35
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,430
with cybersecurity are a big part of the

36
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,670
system that's why sometimes we neglect

37
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,710
certain acts based which are fundamental

38
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,530
not only for us but also for society as

39
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:56,780
a whole because society and said being

40
00:02:52,530 --> 00:03:00,630
dependent on technology 95% our

41
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:04,410
technology makes our lives secure and we

42
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,090
need a secure and safer technology to

43
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,790
avoid attacks against government's

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,860
citizens we cyber security guards are a

45
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,780
big part to protect cyber security and

46
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,450
society as a whole I'd like to comment

47
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:20,220
on the fact that we are on a open sex

48
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,790
operational security we have to be

49
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,970
careful about how we deal with secure a

50
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,380
scene from age how we do do the rooms

51
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,690
every two key to research what time

52
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,690
tools we use if we are working on

53
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:37,140
corporate or business or governmental

54
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,060
and secret with deal with a low informal

55
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,640
group to protect cyber security or other

56
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,560
entities we have to be careful because

57
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,670
sometimes we can be the target up to

58
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,580
threats and attacks from adversaries in

59
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,299
principle this seem that they not exist

60
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:58,610
but they exist do you remember this

61
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:02,240
picture oh we oh gosh we remember

62
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:05,960
we have heard from being in the hackers

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:09,890
and cyber threat were this movie turned

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:13,730
turned on is new man tentative

65
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,799
anniversaire so it doesn't have anything

66
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,890
to do with the current society we are

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,590
having so many political threats look a

68
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:24,590
lot alike which we can seen on screen on

69
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:29,150
so many nations very well nations

70
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:31,969
prefers to without a budget to attack

71
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:36,140
and offensive attitudes against targets

72
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:39,770
in between sometimes we feel like being

73
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:43,940
wearing em plus em silver had on the

74
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,640
head we wanted to get into house with no

75
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,430
magnetic field or technology people some

76
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,830
people want justic Lutheran sucks from

77
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,800
this technology by seeing the the

78
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,900
magnetic and problems that cyber

79
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,240
security issue triggers over some people

80
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,000
panic about so we need a professional

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,650
security in degree and we try to avoid

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,290
that potential bursary is can obtain or

83
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,380
get our information any or interfere

84
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:15,919
operation sabotage our investigations

85
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,800
and researches to get into the back door

86
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:23,030
of our house our software your developed

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:27,680
in in the client-server so we need to be

88
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:30,380
very careful values as XK CD with

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,320
members are the very first but never led

90
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,840
we are the weakest change easiest to

91
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,229
torture us to hit as good as Steve

92
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,710
rather than breaking the levels of the

93
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:44,240
fence at citizens and in cyber security

94
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,969
companies have we human beings are the

95
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,460
big target so that's why personal

96
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,810
security is a big issue some weeks ago

97
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:57,330
on this newspaper open

98
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,910
open on each word we saw this article

99
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,669
saying that I see is after the Paris

100
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,950
attacks I just had a manual about how to

101
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:10,560
recommend the participants how to use

102
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:13,440
new technology it was not an operational

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:19,620
security hi sis base manner it was

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:24,270
intended for gaza-based journal is the

105
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,340
necessity is from journalists in a gas

106
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:31,020
had to descend over information being

107
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:34,109
spied on I'm saying Gaza over rain could

108
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,990
be a maraca all other countries were

109
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,330
there there may be other problems for

110
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:43,230
journalists in reality we will see this

111
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:46,140
the needs are the very same as the

112
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:49,770
operational security or somebody from

113
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:54,240
the isis the islamic an army one example

114
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:56,549
is when we can see on this startup l

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,960
jackson is case on twitter but we don't

116
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:06,420
know who he is he is accepted he used

117
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,940
satires someday well one cares i'm going

118

119
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,190
anonymous accounts on Twitter nobody

120
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:19,020
wants who is behind I'm going to try to

121
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:23,760
unmask who is start up l jackson i will

122
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:27,060
recommend another no no she looked chief

123
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,270
in security quiz behind what happens

124
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,220
here

125
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,409
I'm one person he said I'm gonna try to

126
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:37,390
discover who is the person be high in

127
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:39,220
this tutorial how they did by mistakes

128
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:43,750
and failures the original owner the

129
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:46,330
count committed well Jack's only publish

130
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:50,740
the very first stop shop on the left

131
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:54,190
with a scream shop in LA Laser laser

132
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:58,420
which is a social networking application

133
00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:02,100
doing haggle nozzle nozzle so the people

134
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,720
who wins behind people who are behind

135
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,910
ikea has a very same image that l

136
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,400
jackson uploaded after conducting a lot

137
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:12,310
of research and taking out a lot of

138
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,880
followers and by reducing the size of

139
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:20,230
user he found there was a user with

140
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:22,690
their same script shop covered so it was

141
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:28,600
able to discover you know Jackson

142
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:31,390
identity i know this very case with a

143
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,930
image processing he discovered who he

144
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:38,289
was this very case out of the various

145
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:41,799
operational mistake l jackson which

146
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:45,219
teacher was uncovered it was only a

147
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,709
satirist he published in the screenshot

148
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,220
I making this mistake he was discovered

149
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:54,850
so operational security team from the

150
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,860
very first times out of the world it's

151
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,140
important when you are leaving behind

152
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,110
secret society of documentation

153
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,760
confidential information the first and

154
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:09,100
second world war there were so many

155
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:13,900
opposed describe him a soldier Mariah

156
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:16,390
marine when he was the drunk in a bar

157
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,150
and commanded work he was going to do

158

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:28,240
to the enemies of could be still

161

have done it so interesting things for

166

interests my own vintage person accused

170
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,450
see in the soldiers women obviously in

171
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:02,860
to match this dates back to the 13th

172
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:07,720
floor kiss these lips my single ships

173
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:09,640
loose lips sink ships so you any

174
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,150
messages you are telling your friends on

175
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:16,240
a bar in on the streets can be used by

176
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:19,720
adversary we're talking about wars there

177
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,030
are so much awareness and this we need

178
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,920
to recover awareness in the subjective

179
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,500
word this exemplifies works about as

180
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:31,959
portable secrecy 10 stand assembly

181
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:38,890
required Brad Obama hires and special

182
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:42,280
tent generating noise around so nobody

183
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,020
want nobody wants to see and won't be

184
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,170
able to see what Barack Obama's is doing

185
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:51,370
inside this room there's they're

186
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:53,949
generating another this campaign and war

187
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,890
10 where he can discuss with this

188
00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:00,790
muffled noise and surrounding things so

189
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:03,210
how can this affect me the drain we do

190
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,500
use with the views and things

191
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,260
confidentially medical publishing

192
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,840
exploits

193
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:15,040
choose us to jump over cyber security

194
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:18,760
measures how can we deceive am doing you

195
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,130
break that in the hands of the attackers

196
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,819
in the hands of somebody that want us to

197
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:26,800
do the malicious nails we take care of

198
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:30,280
Governor security by helping governments

199
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,430
us to combating threats fortify

200
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:36,250
themselves we use journalists we

201
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,650
collaborate with journalists who are in

202
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,900
certain countries doing research in

203
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:45,370
showing the reality of their countries

204
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,800
we collaborate with them the law

205
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:52,000
informants group there is a closeness

206
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:55,300
between the list of your sirs but not

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,700
much Ultimo's region policy is sleep

208
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,849
guards life-forms groups are

209
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,970
collaborating themselves and we may be

210
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,730
in the enemy territory we may go to a

211
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,250
country where it's very likely that we

212
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,430
can be a spy on because we are doing

213
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,790
just giving information work the

214
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,949
countries where the malware where many

215
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,680
people want you to know my testing

216
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:25,330
conducted in the enemy country we have a

217
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:29,680
an agreement with Microsoft published in

218
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:33,340
whenever it is about Windows 10 simple

219
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,130
speaking at personal level for our for

220
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:39,740
the sake of our privacy intimacy our

221
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:43,040
pictures we don't want them to have them

222
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,920
this is based upon the thing on how

223
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,339
established our strategy and taking a

224
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,439
car of our operational security we need

225
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,970
the threat modeling this points on

226
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,730
screen what we want to protect assets

227
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:02,390
against a versus whom we want to protect

228
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:06,440
ourselves who is our adversary which is

229
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:09,319
the likelihood of having bad situation

230
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,920
of getting our information stolen our

231
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,950
strategic exploits and how much ever

232
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,469
they have to devote protective depend on

233
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,020
the FI want avoid I can apply some

234
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,660
measures or other general istic ly

235
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:26,660
speaking for us to say it's clear that

236
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:29,900
depend who might my attacker or the

237
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:33,920
bursary is we need to conduct several

238
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:37,760
different plans because in the enemy is

239
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,189
number C is this different from somebody

240
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,640
who is published in our pictures eating

241
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:47,210
who is the bursary who is targeted mean

242
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,280
I need a specific measures first verse

243
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:54,230
it can be top nations with a big budget

244
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:58,100
a lot of people with they can x sin x

245
00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:00,110
place i'm going after you you say is

246
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:05,240
Right China Russia shape the big nations

247
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:08,900
after your guard lost now sometimes the

248
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,790
level of poverty depends on their

249
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,939
capacity of acting sometimes other

250
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:17,300
adversity have the lease budget that

251
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:21,020
other nature but his modus operandi may

252
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,530
be different Long Wharf some criminal

253
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:27,040
attackers terrorist groups malicious

254
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:31,780
employees and curious people or

255
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,370
regarding the Bramson word they can't

256
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,000
mother can take all data from out that

257
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:39,510
machine

258
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,270
if you are the target of a nation-state

259
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,550
you are going to have a bad time even if

260
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,730
you don't have a computer you're lost if

261
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,620
you're a target big nations can take

262
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:55,210
other information from asked spinners

263
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:58,270
and attacks are addictive totally we saw

264
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,670
it with the the cases no then the more

265
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:05,770
information you extracted in those you

266
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:07,959
got and want it so he did a he want to

267
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,300
get as much information as possible his

268
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:15,880
degree and information is power is

269
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:19,930
domination you own the information is to

270
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:22,870
gain so information is gold and you can

271
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:25,510
see it's easier to attack them defend

272
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:28,270
defend our self-esteem it's difficult if

273
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:34,230
you leave a small hole somatic King

274
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:34,230
slick him to the whole versus against us

275
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,350
besides we are living through a crisis

276
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,880
of confidence when it comes to hardware

277
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,490
we may be protected in the software

278
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,640
level but a higher level are we really

279
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:51,580
protective our hardware is secure and

280
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,710
safe and our computer our wires or why

281
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:58,720
he is not in fact they're quick how can

282
00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:04,210
we know it is that's our hardest have a

283
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:06,160
back door we didn't know with the

284
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:10,740
hardware is Bay and transistor worthy

285
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:15,300
and trustworthy so they took pictures of

286
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:18,190
implant houses from the rooters through

287
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,430
localization installing a back door and

288
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:24,100
send him back to the client so in a sub

289
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,949
today the company has lost good examples

290
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,320
we can see on screen from Edward Snowden

291
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:34,690
is no then says to us at the GUI our

292
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:36,400
targets we are I hands systems

293
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:42,100
administrators

294
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:45,550
faizon's diplomat in the nation or CEO

295
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:49,210
in a company what am I going to attack

296
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:53,709
him it's simpler simpler to attack them

297
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:55,570
I IPO please the ICP of this diplomat

298
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,430
easier to take out who to sneak in

299
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,740
through you see in to their

300
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:02,370
communication and steal them how can I

301
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:06,130
eat and how can I do so let's go through

302
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:09,010
the system network administrator which

303
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,480
manage the passwords and they can access

304
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,129
all the infrastructures looking at

305
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,170
target discipline straighter you can

306
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,650
read through this document you can know

307
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:19,209
who he is connected to the Reuters

308
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,250
administration's once the IP is

309
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:25,000
connected they look for the gmail

310
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:27,599
facebook from this IP so what users they

311
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,420
are connected to and so they get their

312
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,429
users from the administrators of

313
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:37,330
innovative way and they are using a

314
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:39,400
mapping of network and by unwinding the

315
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,730
thread they can get compromising

316
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,440
information with an IP you know these

317
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,530
things one of the pins the biggest

318
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,650
famous person with the last year's

319
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:53,170
making the whole world tumbling our

320
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:55,060
security system is tumbling because of

321
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,670
neighbors know them and we discovered

322
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:01,510
that magical tools were not this magical

323
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:04,500
so for instance then is the NSA is not

324
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:07,050
made of magic commercial open source

325
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:11,620
they're very similar to open source and

326
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:15,970
opening and commercial tools the N is a

327
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:18,610
tools Oh having some experts and

328
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,450
different bad NSA is very dangerous

329
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,320
minute so any Brean is meta data

330
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,900
communications with the data fields in

331
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,909
icy Ridge discovered that all

332
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,610
information from course in the United

333
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:34,180
States worse capture routed through

334
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,570
their stage it look like nothing happens

335
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,880
Arkham

336
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:40,340

340
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,410
can see this information seems not to be

341
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:53,570
important but this was super relevant

342
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:56,360

soil at this moment in time in that area

355
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:41,030
what mobile phones were working around

356
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:43,850

358
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:51,050
discovered 18 people holders on that

359
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:52,969
area that very moment the got

360
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,430
information of the clothesline mobile

361
00:19:52,970 --> 00:20:00,800
only got information they related this

362
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:04,430
phone to each other we had been sign up

363
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:07,940
very resonant three months ago and they

364
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:12,740
were released and the register one week

365
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:15,920
ago one week after so they check out the

366
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:20,180
nearby hotels were these the phone

367
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:24,370
covers and owner will stay in and what

368
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:27,980
the restaurants they have dinners so

369
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:31,820
this doesn't CIA operation on Italian

370
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:36,700
soil in an oven authorized way so the CI

371
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,700
is hard check these people

372
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:46,300
in Italian soil so the CIA is dating

373
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:50,140
back to 2,000 4d as follows this CIA

374
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:53,440
agent to avoid their mobile phone being

375
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:58,060

376
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:02,050
doritos chips packages which are in the

377
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:06,909
states they have em protecting material

378
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:09,970
on the radio transmission signal but the

379
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:14,320
CIA agent started by putting the phone

380
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:18,160
the phone into the doritos chips box

381
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,370
this was a body in the bin capture but

382
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,770
no they did in fact they could take out

383
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:26,080
all the information they struck in the

384
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,870
map in they have there was a diplomatic

385
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,120
conflict between the States and Italy an

386
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,810
edge of the world there are also many

387
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,370
interests makes operational mistakes as

388
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:40,450
how this can be relevant present

389
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:43,600
explicit CIA spy squad for execution in

390
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:46,710

391
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,919
made operational mistakes prison Beirut

392
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:53,710
Lebanon CI aliens were detected by head

393
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,470
volim because they use my phone that

394
00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:02,860
were not mobile they were steady

395
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:07,570
landline phones starting a band sudden

396
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:10,419

following up on and in tracking the

398
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:17,590
Lebanon phone communication detected

399
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:22,420
anomalies and faults in 11 an opening

supposed not to have a computer connect

412
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:06,129
on internet so bin Laden and was

413
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:10,029

00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:28,449
have to kill Don please chief bob quick

420
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:32,070
steps down over terror blunder there was

421
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:34,539
some a high commissioner

422
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:38,769
counter-attacked ER is in the internet a

423
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:41,139
kingdom only on the sheet he got the

424
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:43,090
name of all the people to be detained so

425
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:46,869
then for the photographers took a

426
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:50,019
picture of this list of to be arrested

427
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:51,220
people because he neglected the

428
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:54,759
protection of the information there are

429
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:57,820
so many examples of USB bulletins with

430
00:23:54,759 --> 00:24:01,360
informations you tricked error lies

431
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:04,269
Latin training so this impact this

432
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,539
impacts our security opposite of opie

433
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:11,249
sick Russians of your toes self is from

434
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:15,820
inside Ukraine surface where she located

435
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:19,419
in Ukraine big mistakes people don't

436
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:22,480
care about it John McAfee very famous

437
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:25,059
case he was looking by the players

438
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:31,389
looking for by the place he tweeted out

439
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:34,658
a picture where we we knew were McAfee

440
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:37,899
was of Elysium interesting case Oh while

441
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:41,710
its aircraft can be track online how

442
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:45,008
Boko Haram keeps his secrets secret very

443
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:47,590
interesting case unfortunately both can

444
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:48,519
take sort of care about using new

445
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,449
technology

446
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,769
use my old phones didn't use they hardly

447
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,299
just entered it because they know that

448
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:57,070
they can be tracked down the middle so

449
00:24:55,299 --> 00:25:00,789
Coco he knows how to protect themselves

450
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:03,009
in fact this article published sentiment

451
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:07,809
some while ago coming first the

452
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:10,690
operational manual from HC cool which is

453
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:13,539
as part of the British intelligence with

454
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:16,779
against over suit he had these manuals

455
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:20,679
back at that time we can compare what

456
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:22,779
was published by Isis very similarly in

457
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:24,759
the intelligence services in certain

458
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:28,229
countries have to take the very same

459
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:31,529
precautions as many adversaries do

460
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:35,049
terrorist groups organized crime

461
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:38,079
gangsters to avoid being discover or

462
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:40,089
amex regarding their criminal faction

463
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,668
there is a very interesting book from

464
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:44,379
Pablo to Osama trafficking and terrorist

465
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:48,429
networks government vehicles dis.n

466
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:51,549
competitive adaptation the night traffic

467
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:56,499
were in Colombia in the 80s compared

468
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:59,499
with al-qaeda group in the 911 the

469
00:25:56,499 --> 00:26:02,739
there's underline that similarities

470
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:05,829
between the transfer of information if a

471
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:08,950
cell is captured we should not be we

472
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:13,889
learn from others mistakes or again the

473
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:16,719
d.e.a the american dragon saucier an

474
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:21,039
agency or the CIA what kind of

475
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:22,629
advantages we have versus of law

476
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,749
enforcement group of the secret services

477
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:29,559
an important thing if we are getting

478
00:26:25,749 --> 00:26:33,279
into computing world deeper deeper we're

479
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:36,879
going to silk road when Ross whole

480
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:42,339
virtual a key a cat dragged by Robert

481
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:44,829
was capture he draws in just a lot of

482
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:47,469
drugs Ross footage they make it several

483
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:50,440
mistake that facilitated and enabled

484
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:55,070
their detention Rose was in the library

485
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:58,880
Ross orbit used leverage to connect

486
00:26:55,070 --> 00:27:04,539
sudan amelie anonymously or pseudonymous

487
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:12,409
leave how can i do an HTTP so he puppies

488
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:15,080
on stock flow he is PHP code which was

489
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:17,840
nuisances his real name then changed to

490
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,658
frosty at frosty he made a lot of

491
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,709
mistakes that the house was arrested or

492
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:27,769
the case of Sabu loser who was some

493

whistleblower for the FB I am Sabu made

494
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:36,110

00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:42,639
connect you to them today to lowes AG he

496
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:46,189
used I RC to communicate on T or oh he

497

stand back kneels to his display to his

498
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:51,110
house so detests hotel cells problem we

499
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:53,899
can have cyber security guys we can make

500
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:57,229
me say that can reveal who we are Dooku

501
00:27:53,899 --> 00:28:01,668
and the equation of group everything can

502
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:04,460
be forced and falsified of the binary

503
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:08,870
completion from ducati creation group

504
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:12,950
can be clearly seen as somebody not

505
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:16,549
working on saturday on fridays and

506
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:19,899
saturdays he only work on sundays and

507
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:23,330
with the time zone you can determine

508
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:27,379
that he was vision a default block it

509
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:30,199
was attributed the origin of this thread

510
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:32,600
the compilation of the binaries and

511
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,529
their hours the work this brigade the

512
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:38,799
whole team so we are seen how can this

513
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:41,059
affect me because i'm working on

514
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,639
security since I here could it be

515
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:47,408
careful about not revealing confidential

516
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:49,820
information there are the golden rules

517
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:52,759
very first we have to compare mentalize

518
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:56,000
we have to put in in compartments the

519
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:58,890
model form for work should be different

520
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,860
for the private more phones

521
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:05,250
need to have a working future and a home

522
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,850
computer different she did it maybe not

523
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:11,760
practice the pain of the rd degree

524
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:14,520
paranoia it's important sigh frame

525
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,850
encryption is important if we encrypt

526
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,190
things and protects us much better than

527
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,649
our information sharing the algorithm

528
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,260
the key we're using is important grass

529
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:29,640
to encrypt important in the air gap

530
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:34,050
airgas important as well there are so

531
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:40,830
much controversy about this in the Paris

532
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:43,320
attacks so separate encryption methods

533
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:46,040
should work should have a back door to

534
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,980
because they can help us to capture

535
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:53,700
there is another type of criminals this

536
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,170
is a moment of tension oh how will this

537
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,990
end up but be careful about the

538
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:00,990
information we are using whether it is

539
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:03,030
from clients journalist friends because

540
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,070
somebody can be interested in it there

541
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:08,670
is also very important issues like the

542
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:11,820
highlight which is killas 3.0 you might

543
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:15,390
have use it about the boots hands into

544
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:19,350
compartments we open a file a virtual

545
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:23,310
machine starts up if I want to see the

546
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:26,610
emails an emachine opens up to decipher

547
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:29,870
that the emails or the files if we say

548
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:32,669
exploits on PowerPoint we have been sent

549
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:35,040
an attack only the virtual specific

550
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,770
machine compromise on the area can be

551
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,010
attacked regarding cyber security so

552
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:45,060
over time operating systems will end up

553
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:47,360
in compartmented areas where we can be

554
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:51,330
fine our activities in small areas

555
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:55,050
regarding the emails depending on your

556
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:58,590
degree upon oh yeah dude shouldn't we

557
00:30:55,050 --> 00:31:01,139
not use so emails but you want to

558
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,199
protect our information a lot because we

559
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,710
are working in a company

560
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,470
you want to present an offer to our the

561
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,300
canal de Panama worth two thousand

562
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,280
million euros we don't want to be

563
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:17,020
discovery now in this building tender

564
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:21,520
offer so this will be the intended offer

565
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:25,840
you should eat sand on a map passes more

566
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:29,080
secure potatoes mcchrystal matata yama

567
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,720
careful with metadata regarding calls

568
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,199
files anything that we do on the

569
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:38,320
internet generics context information I

570
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,280
what I told you about pgb it's also

571
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,830
important because today AP gb is

572
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,649
recommendable hammerite is not highly

573
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,210
usable actually there is a very

574
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:53,020
interesting statement from by the

575
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:55,840
creator of it well it says sorry but i

576
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,970
cannot i do not use any other I don't

577
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:04,060
use it anymore because I don't known of

578
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:08,650
my client those are you I don't know

579
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:11,440
anyone who uses it so little aloe juice

580
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:14,680
ability so it seemed interesting to use

581
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:18,180
PGP hamada a sec community who we need

582
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:27,670
to find better ways to improve it and

583
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:32,200
also pgb does not support secrecy well

584
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:36,820
it's Adams having created so as a

585
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:41,710
security community we will have to work

586
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:44,980
to offer better decryption system so

587
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:47,620
encryption systems and to end so what's

588
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,020
up it doesn't really make sense to use

589
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,260
runs up to send out sensitive

590
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:56,080
information or confidential information

591
00:32:52,260 --> 00:33:00,210
and there are other tools for mobile

592
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,040
phones that's a figma palm as a

593
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:06,070
decentralized system is also very

594
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:10,550
interesting but low disability

595
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:14,600
OTR is useful as well however all the

596
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:17,149
open source tools based on out TR

597
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,090
Frances Lee purple which is poorly

598
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:23,200
developed has lots of flows and then the

599
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:28,750
same as communication well tour is

600
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:32,720
useful for some people for instance

601
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:35,960
people or journalists in can't do store

602
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,860
in those countries but they are prone to

603
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:46,160
be spied on so at the end of the day

604
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:52,280
tour may abstract you or may link you

605
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:54,850
with the VMP address you are using so we

606
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:58,340
should be very careful we should not mix

607
00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:00,590
anonymity with privacy and actually

608
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,560
there are two such as portal which is a

609
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:10,969
hot way for instance when we travel we

610
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:14,509
just connect a Wi-Fi router so that

611
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:18,020
everything all the traffic that coming

612
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:22,399
out of our computer goes through tor in

613
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:25,509
the case of pond pants is not very

614
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,969
useful however the problem of Hades

615
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:31,100
security this is not highly secure and

616
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:33,439
then for instance if it trouble if we

617
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,870
travel we will have it we had lots of

618
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,149
money we will have to use like a

619
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,850
disposable computer but that is not

620
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:43,549
practical at all so depending on the

621
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:46,339
plates or the country where we travel

622
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:49,610
perhaps we may want to delete data

623
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:52,130
before we go into that country or delete

624
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,260
country as we leave the country

625
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:59,030
especially if we believe that someone

626
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:04,340
may have in fact infected our buyers so

627
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:07,160
also there are well for instance we may

628
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:10,610
be prone to be attacked if we just leave

629
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:14,270
our computer on at our hotel and we go

630
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:16,330
for dinner so we should carry our

631
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:18,030
computer on us all the time

632
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:22,410
so that it is not that easily

633
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:27,610
compromised in also social networks

634
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:31,600
sometimes we upload images on the social

635
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:33,550
networks and we may be I don't know

636
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:36,279
disclosing information section

637
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:38,440
information political information or

638
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:43,180
confidential information without rub

639
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:45,810
ourselves well we have to use important

640
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:49,810
to use a strong password for best

641
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:54,460
passwords to ensure that our information

642
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:59,940
is secure alrighty let's take a look at

643
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,940
the most secure man in the f

644
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,780
his passwords are 30 characters with no

645
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,670
words and no repeating characters they

646
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:21,220
change once a week and he has never

647
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:25,600
written one down he can complete the

648
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:29,040
five-part OPSEC process in one step he

649
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:33,009
is the most secure man in the world I

650
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:39,630
always practice up sick and so should

651
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:39,630
you stay secure my friends

652
00:36:44,809 --> 00:36:50,849
or assume video connect on caffeine los

653
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:54,569
militares well this is a video by the US

654
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:57,630
military okay in the humorous manner

655
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:59,700
shows the importance of everything that

656
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,549
we have been discussing and now I'd like

657
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:07,288
to finish my presentation with giving

658
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:12,499
you further information so we may use

659
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:16,499
all them as guidelines that will help us

660
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:19,399
protect our I information so that we

661
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:22,410
don't disclose more information that we

662
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,619
should ok so the door so will help us

663
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:29,009
protect ourselves as well as our devices

664
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:30,479
so well these are helpful links to you
