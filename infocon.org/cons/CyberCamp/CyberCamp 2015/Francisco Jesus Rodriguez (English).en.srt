1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,780
empezamos alright we start now okay and

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,910
so my name is Leticia Rodriguez I

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,070
introduce myself or does a few presents

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,250
here and those of you following me from

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,439
your home and my name is Francisco Jose

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,259
Rodriguez and nothing asked to talk

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:28,529
about honey pots which have a trump

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:32,160
sensors ok so today I will give an

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,500
introduction as to honey pots and tell

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,529
you what they have four different types

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,019
as well as the information that we

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,570
gathered through honey pots and then I

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,210
will talk about honey station which is a

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,520
proof of concept that I could have been

15
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,980
developing for one year now because I

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,780
had a personal need to visualize all the

17
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,309
information that I was gathering through

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:00,629
sensors and I wanted to display it on

19
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:03,300
screen as I in the same manner that as

20
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,640
about seeing it in my mind and now later

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:11,970
on I will finish off with some real

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:15,000
cases so if you like let's start with

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,158
the definition of honey pots we've read

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,049
out honey pot is a resource that

25
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,540
simulates or pretends to be a real

26
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,119
objective that is waiting to be attacked

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,920
will compromise the main objective is to

28
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,159
distract attackers and to obtain

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,960
information about the attack and the

30
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:36,960
attacker so the could be a real machine

31
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:43,979
or I don't know a Raspberry Pi that we

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:47,970
can buy on the internet so what is the

33
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:51,710
purpose of using these sensors first of

34
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:56,119
all we are have them there

35
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:58,309
on a deliberate manner to we want to

36
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,550
expose it to the attacker we want to

37
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,509
distract the attacker because as long as

38
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:09,079
the attacker is focusing on our device

39
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:12,590
would not focus on the other ones okay

40
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,090
so we get one to get information as much

41
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,209
as possible information from the

42
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,480
attacker we prefer to this elements in

43
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:25,790
greater detail later on another purpose

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,340
is to obtain a trap attack trends so for

45
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,179
us to find out the type of honey pots

46
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:35,209
that we want to deploy well sometimes we

47
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,239
may want to deploy a sensor on attack

48
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:42,080
the port that is being often attacked we

49
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,500
also want to detect malware or malicious

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,959
campaigns sometimes these campaigns

51
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,540
appear and they stay there for quite

52
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,900
some time and eventually they disappear

53
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,440
but some campaigns malware contains a

54
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,239
more prevalent than others and then

55
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,750
learning learning as much as possible

56
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:06,260
from the attacker from the attack from

57
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:09,370
everything then also we want to detect

58
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:18,700
new vulnerabilities and then malware

59
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:22,579
well ranging from executable files

60
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,160
x-files and what its most interesting of

61
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:28,250
all that is that many of these are not

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:32,239
detected by anti viruses so we want to

63
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,840
do both dynamic and static analysis to

64
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,420
find out what is happening and glass

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,420
supplementing other security solutions

66
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:44,208
they coexist perfectly all right with

67
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:46,730
firewalls and other type of security

68
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,739
solutions in terms of consideration this

69
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,959
is not a system in production and no one

70
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:53,180
should come try to communicate with it

71
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,300
so if no one knows that the sensor is

72
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,230
there so nothing

73
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:03,130
reach to it however this does not happen

74
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:05,170
in practice and you will see that we

75
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:09,340
will always be receiving some kinds of

76
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:12,760
security event any traffic aimed at a

77
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,700
honeypot is considered suspicious but it

78
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,599
is an attack you just a survey and any

79
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:22,210
traffic that comes out of our honey pots

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,120
would mean that our system has been

81
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,620
compromised sometimes attackers the

82
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,060
first thing that they check out is

83
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,570
whether there is an external

84
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,180
connectivity or sometimes mahwah tries

85
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:37,510
to the load another sample and that's

86
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,760
when the alarms are triggered avoiding

87
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,610
any potential attack to any other

88
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,270
equipment or to third party we have to

89
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,860
be very careful with that because if you

90
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:56,289
another equipment in our infrastructure

91
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:58,750
may be attacked as well as ours many

92
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:02,050
times and asked how long does it take

93
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:08,770
see the moment you take a sensor up

94
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:11,010
until you receive an attack or survey so

95
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,109
this sensor has been placed in a

96
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,690
residential dmz for instance those that

97
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:24,070
any of us have at home i'll show you how

98
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:26,919
long it takes to receive an attack so on

99
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,500
top you see the time at nine thirty in

100
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:34,150
the morning number of events porch that

101
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:36,910
are open and that's our patch that we

102
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,510
tell us when the tax takes place minute

103
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,510
has gone by

104
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,380
so taking shorter and longer depends on

105
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,710
where you place your honey pots in some

106
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:53,510
countries may take longer than other

107
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:56,060
depends so two minutes have gone by we

108
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,469
are waiting who have them received any

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,090
attacks what do you think the first

110
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,729
security event would come from from

111
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:05,169
which country I mean yeah from over

112
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:09,740
there alright so how done minute 34

113
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:12,010
solve the patch will walnuts will tell

114
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:17,510
us that we are about the first event

115
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:21,020
there we go it's just an attack has been

116
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:23,449
made from that IT to port 23 from China

117
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,760
if you were to wait for a few more

118
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:32,169
minutes we will see how many events we

119
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:34,760
get few minutes later we'll have 89

120
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:36,799
security events so several ports and

121
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,620
several countries there if we were to

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,780
leave there for a few hours on so we

123
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:46,400
wait final number of events so the pet

124
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,450
cannot put up with so much pressure

125
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:57,200
because if received 2144 events in only

126
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:59,870
three hours so 423 port 22 port 80 a bit

127
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,169
of everything coming from China Bosnia

128
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:07,849
the u.s. Germany Spain Brazil Taiwan

129
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:09,919
Korea Morocco turkey and DC so all the

130
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:12,490
time if we have waited for one more hour

131
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,219
the number would just have skyrocketed

132
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:21,039
so as you can see on the screen well

133
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,039
they will come from a few IP addresses

134
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,860
so how do we classify honey pots

135
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,710
first of all because of the usage they

136
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,080
may be production research ones often

137
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,729
the production plants are real lady with

138
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,130
the sensors that we have in our intended

139
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,200
network and the research ones are those

140
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:43,909
that are installed outside whether it is

141
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:46,159
a DMZ or UPS so the aim of the

142
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,790
production was is to prevent and detect

143
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,370
and respond to attacks to protect the

144
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:54,650
organization and to warn the

145
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:57,340
administrators about something going on

146
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:01,219
so those attacks may come from infected

147
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,679
equipment why not from users are our

148
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,710
network legitimate users that are doing

149
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,040
some kind of activity that should not be

150
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,780
doing so regarding reset honey pots we

151
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,660
objective is to learn as much as

152
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,340
possible and to retain the intruder as

153
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,140
much as possible to learn as much as

154
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,159
possible and then in terms of

155
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:25,669
interaction interaction refers to the

156
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,430
number of options that we will actions

157
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:30,080
that we let our attacker do so the

158
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,210
higher interaction the higher the risk

159
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,100
but also the higher amount of

160
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,190
information that we will get low

161
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,920
interaction here we simulate services or

162
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:43,640
operating systems and limiting activity

163
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:47,329
and here the risk a cell of risk it is

164
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,800
easy to install and to maintain and also

165
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:54,410
very easy to detect by an expert user

166
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:59,689
medium interaction higher interaction

167
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:04,189
higher risk and then we obtain higher

168
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:07,040
samples of information and then hi

169
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:10,070
months I want maybe physical of real or

170
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,040
virtual so the risk would also be high

171
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,590
however but it's important is to

172
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,459
remember that we have to monitor that

173
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,920
all the time so that

174
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,109
we prevent other equipment in our

175
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,449
infrastructure from being also attacked

176
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,720
when they will have a high interaction

177
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:29,939
honey what we really need to do a

178
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,920
forensic analysis in order to find out

179
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:34,529
all the attacks that we have received

180
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,618
that requires but some time and then it

181
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:40,019
is also high maintenance and highly

182
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:43,679
costly so in terms of implementation

183
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:46,980
could either be physical or virtual we

184
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,990
can then in terms of wrong well we have

185
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,019
the clients that means that we go and

186
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,329
search whoever Tucker we have jazz or

187
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,610
Charlie tools doing that for us oh the

188
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:59,729
server which is for a search engine and

189
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,709
recording location those of us who have

190
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,740
when some of us have an internal network

191
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:07,498
and others have a network that publishes

192
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,240
information out TMZ etc advantages

193
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:13,079
protection rubber system preventing

194
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,269
attacks minimum resources such as I said

195
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:17,878
you can just install it in the raspberry

196
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,230
and we can set it up in another network

197
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,790
to find out what is happening there

198
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:25,709
minimum false positives so detection of

199
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:28,679
internal and external attacks and

200
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:30,779
produces little information but valuable

201
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:34,799
information but there are some downsides

202
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:36,420
to it some new no contribution if they

203
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,999
are not attacked no matter how many

204
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,399
probes we have a sensors if they are not

205
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:45,240
attacked we get nothing from that then

206
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:48,689
limited vision honeypot only detect

207
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,399
activity whenever the honeypot is

208
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:53,719
attacked but does not detect any

209
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,869
activity in equipment around hi

210
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,089
interaction higher risk then other

211
00:10:57,869 --> 00:11:03,959
choice that may detect it will have

212
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:07,230
tools for curry Dagny that can detect

213
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:10,160
that it is a sensor there is also some

214
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,720
metasploit fingerprinting as well

215
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,120
fingerprinting

216
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,300
will help us detect some of the

217
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,689
behaviors of the center and one by we

218
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,609
note that it is honey and regarding

219
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:25,509
fingerprinting and recommended that you

220
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:28,790
listen to the black hat presentation

221
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:30,500
telling you how to detect honey pots

222
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,750
that we may find on the internet and

223
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,629
then services when we're inside our IP

224
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:38,569
address and then where we find out who

225
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:42,649
tells us but it is honey pot or not so

226
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:46,160
what makes us mrs. pictures well our

227
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:48,740
actually the attacker so a little no

228
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,810
activity in the system many ports are

229
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,629
open or perhaps the combinations are not

230
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,939
realistic we should always remember that

231
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:59,319
the ports that we install should be as

232
00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:02,689
close as possible to a real system so

233
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:05,959
sofa by default you know some sensors

234
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:10,399
have some files and fruits that are easy

235
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:13,189
to detect okay OS x defaulters let Sally

236
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,730
Joseph hi introduction Prince's windows

237
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:21,199
with no purchase patches whatsoever it

238
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:24,529
may make the attacker suspected that's

239
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:30,920
not what he's expecting little software

240
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:37,339
installed and last very appealing files

241
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:44,800
and folders within the sensors who are

242
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:51,680
the users of our sensor so this is a

243
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:54,229
real demo ok so we have user introducing

244
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,508
commands first of all lots of attacks

245
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,329
have you received from come compromised

246
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,499
equipment

247
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:04,920
so in the last campaign we have had many

248
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:08,129
routers attacking devices through port

249
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:11,248
23 and travie legitimate users of the

250
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:13,589
Realtors don't even know that the

251
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:17,429
devices are launching attacks everywhere

252
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:19,410
so script kiddies that is to say less

253
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,929
knowledgeable users when they go into

254
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,389
Holly party start to try to do

255
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:27,420
everything to execute the malware and

256
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,790
sometimes they go a bit crazy because

257
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,459
the actual honey is not responding as

258
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:35,009
they are expecting you to respond and

259
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:39,988
then when humorous situations arise that

260
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:45,769
cyber crime nurse of cyber attackers

261
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:45,769
with advanced knowledge researchers

262
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:54,378
researchers that launched the service on

263
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:57,470
the internet in an effort to look for

264
00:13:54,379 --> 00:14:00,089
vulnerabilities old adage locked

265
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,759
registers in novel sensor and then

266
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:07,699
troller vog that mark smith are not

267
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:11,009
visited port 80 and last attack us with

268
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:14,248
little clearer infection intentions some

269
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:18,360
of them to force a brute force attacks

270
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:21,029
and then they leave others just in sets

271
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,389
of commands and leave so there is a bit

272
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:27,299
of everything so we want all the time to

273
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:30,649
analyze on that to find out about the

274
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,649
intention of the attackers

275
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:40,209
even if we find confine it and

276
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,000
commercial solutions these are free

277
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:45,720
tools you may get if you are interested

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,200
in that you may have honey drive or

279
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,330
distribution HD ADHD and then a number

280
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,960
of sensors that may regulate some

281
00:14:52,330 --> 00:15:00,820
services such as people for 422 a moon

282
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,980
4435 port so there is a bit of

283
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,640
everything these are tools available to

284
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,230
you this is a link to github so here

285
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,560
there is a wide range of resources

286
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:16,420
related to this and those of you who

287
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:25,630
like programming do have the left

288
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:31,209
Trista's the twisted library now second

289
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:32,950
point this is about information so that

290
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:37,200
is to save information that we get

291
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:42,550
through our sensors first of all the

292
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:45,640
trends so here this helps me decide on

293
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:49,050
the sensor that I need to install on the

294
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,550
internet so we take the center we just

295
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:54,839
install it on the internet and then I

296
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,939
monitor all the TCP ports I could also

297
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:01,110
do it with other ports but I decided to

298
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:05,140
use the TCP ports and this is what I get

299
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:11,440
so there are a number of IP numbers or

300
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:13,059
addresses that instant rapport 423 1904

301
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,879
22

302
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:17,769
let's say this helped us determine or

303
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:22,689
decide on the sensors that we want to

304
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:25,599
install so what do we get from here pull

305
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:27,549
that information on the screen so from

306
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,089
the IP address the first thing that we

307
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:35,169
will get is the art I are then the

308
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:36,789
continents then the coordinates more or

309
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:40,478
less precise depending on the database

310
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:42,939
that we use the country the city the asn

311
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:45,969
that could be our provider and the

312
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:48,759
organization if you are in a local

313
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:52,779
network we can also get the mac number

314
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:58,179
as well as in manufacturer then the date

315
00:16:52,779 --> 00:17:02,789
the port and we can also carry out an

316
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:05,859
active analysis of the attacker Oh

317
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:07,689
suspected attacker and then you can

318
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,809
analyze the port in the services and the

319
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:14,199
operating system once we have the IP

320
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:16,148
addresses we cross that out with public

321
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,129
reputation lists there are many

322
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:20,559
resources available on the internet for

323
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:24,938
that thing I use that with the

324
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,859
information that my honey pot generates

325
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:30,369
for me I really want to find out whether

326
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:34,049
that IP address visited my sensor before

327
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:37,178
we can also compare it against honey DB

328
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:40,480
virustotal in Twitter entry to tell

329
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:44,499
users that are all the time publishing

330
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,350
the information that they get from in

331
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:50,259
there honey pots we can also compare it

332
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:53,889
with ours we can also with proxy system

333
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:57,429
proxy sucks ones and then exit node not

334
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:59,649
too many attackers new store to hide an

335
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:02,049
address and to attack the honey pot and

336
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:06,100
that information is also register and

337
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:09,460
then private lists nearly all of them

338
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,860
are pay lists where they gave you an IP

339
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:16,390
address I tell you what it is a botnet

340
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:19,929
man or what category that

341
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:24,130
addresses once we know the honeypot that

342
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:29,740
we want to install then we would allow a

343
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:33,160
connection to take place information

344
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:36,160
about the chats as I say the moment we

345
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,340
install the sensor we open up a port for

346
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,930
a given service and we don't only obtain

347
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,730
all the information that I told you

348
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:45,970
before and then we also get information

349
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:49,210
from communication first of all the OS

350
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,340
from passive fingerprinting the commands

351
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,560
that executed the actions that are

352
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,179
carried out the exploits that have been

353
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:01,950
used if any and then we could also

354
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:06,100
Mountain IDs before the honey pot and

355
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:08,740
with sensors such as snort or any other

356
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,139
and it will tell as they would sell as

357
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:15,250
the type of attack that is being done

358
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:24,040
with us if we do display deploy a honey

359
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:27,940
web we could also do that now deployment

360
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:31,120
high level one we will deploy honey pots

361
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:33,160
in several countries internet providers

362
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,010
University in the circle track system

363
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,020
public institutions and then we would

364
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,510
centralized information all the

365
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,629
information gathered in the probability

366
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:47,250
sensor will be sent out to a central

367
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:50,650
location for analysis consultation and

368
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:54,520
visualization and actually visualization

369
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:58,510
I was very interested in therefore I

370
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,910
started to develop honey station but

371
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,920
before that I looked through some

372
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:05,380
inspiration on the Internet these are

373
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,010
maps some sure that you know about the

374
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,880
North map so every time cyber world

375
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:15,840
cyber attacks are mentioned on TV you

376
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,929
they deployed this map ok we'll have an

377
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:28,860
the run for car pesky honey prior belief

378
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:31,679
and also the third map and from there I

379
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:34,428
started to develop honey station in the

380
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:44,159
beginning was a proof of concept and

381
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:46,320
this is what it ended up being so this

382
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,679
is the work that I've done in the last

383
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,809
year that have five panels here one of

384
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,980
them is the view of the absa honey pot

385
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:58,918
and the other two from the viewpoint of

386
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,100
the country and from the city so this is

387
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,070
about the attack trends and this is

388
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:14,580
another map about malware and location

389
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:17,158
of the malware let me tell you that this

390
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,590
project have been supported by in civil

391
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:22,049
and it will be included within a group

392
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:25,559
of tools that will made available for

393
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:29,070
the law enforcement agencies for

394
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:32,129
detection of cyberattacks the national

395
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,879
cyber attacks all right I will explain

396
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:41,490
each of these panels to you first panel

397
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:46,049
honey pot of you on the one hand we have

398
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:48,909
the country's then I am sin and then IP

399
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:52,479
addresses josan right

400
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:56,009
are those data have some information

401
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:59,889
about whether they are in a public who

402
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:02,379
travel east and then the the last column

403
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:09,340
we have the port and then the actual

404
00:22:02,379 --> 00:22:12,519
honey as you can see nearly all of them

405
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:22,809
are in red at least at that point in

406
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:28,090
time then I filter them by us so these

407
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:34,049
are all the IP addresses so data about

408
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:34,049
DNS that's online all the time every day

409
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:52,029
so here you will see the information

410
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:57,520
that I can get some reputation list then

411
00:22:52,029 --> 00:23:00,700
the rules the commands and the OS so

412
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:04,299
this time I had two operating system so

413
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:11,200
we'll have a filter for China that's a

414
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:24,850
result well china is number one as you

415
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:28,659
may guess next view is about all the

416
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:30,189
lists so now i have 130 reputation this

417
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:34,240
this is the command that has been

418
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:37,830
executed and then IP address and this is

419
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,630
the file that will be downloaded

420
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:46,510
unloaded to infects our machine next

421
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:50,559
view so real time attacks because the

422
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:54,279
honey is in spain all attacks are

423
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:57,870
targeted to Spain so nearly 11,000

424
00:23:54,279 --> 00:24:02,350
attacks and seventeen thousand of them

425
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:07,090
came from the actual country

426
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:12,280
so we have the top countries to forge

427
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:15,850
talk to us real time attacks happy

428
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:19,570
address port and last we have IP

429
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:23,500
reputation whether they are including

430
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:27,090
any list or any ideas files here we

431
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,090
would get that kind of information

432
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:51,530
next view will offer the same

433
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:55,730
information but at the level of city so

434
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,730
to narrow that information

435
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:11,880
alright trends now so this is what I

436
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:15,500
mentioned before about trends this helps

437
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:20,160
me decide on the sensors that I want to

438
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:24,420
deploy so continent pert organization

439
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:27,150
and ASL and this is a real-time block as

440
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,250
to what is happening a lot and here on

441
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,830
the right we have the treats that rates

442
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:35,250
that i mentioned before so this

443
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:38,550
generates another list that are used for

444
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:44,390
comparison purposes here the map it just

445
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:44,389
me about the origin of those trends

446
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,730
and we have the last one which is the

447
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:02,620
malware view where we have the operating

448
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:12,600
system the operating system of the

449
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:18,159
attacker type of malware so IP addresses

450
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:31,059
so it's not rules that I've been jumped

451
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:33,580
to breached but as the title of my

452
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:37,510
presentation said real-time attack and

453
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:42,220
this is a video so if you like oh I'd

454
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:46,030
like to share with you attacks real time

455
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:51,370
so hopefully network will not fail see

456
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:57,790
we are successful so that's not much to

457
00:26:51,370 --> 00:27:00,399
date so many white addresses so they are

458
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:04,629
not in any reputation list only few of

459
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:16,030
them are on those reputation lists so a

460
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:24,130
bit of everything in there china so

461
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:26,549
attacks to 135 ssh 23 HTTP SQL a bit of

462
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,549
everything

463
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:35,689
these are all the tax tablet or 22

464
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:41,840
received today so this is here you'll

465
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:43,730
have the Century Fox one so we match

466
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,209
that against a reputation list a

467
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:49,429
storeroom and then told us about the

468
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:51,850
operating system and it says that is

469
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:51,850
liners

470
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:58,950
and we could do that with any other

471
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,950
country us which is also highly active

472
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:14,630
possibly a trifle clock at night we

473
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:17,180
cannot really see map okay because very

474
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:26,720
many many security events are generated

475
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:31,580
during the day so here we all sign

476
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:37,400
attacks so at this point in time from

477
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:42,710
Poland Ireland hungry and that goes on

478
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:45,320
and on and on navet dubs so reputation

479
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:48,500
least we'll have a few of them for

480
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:53,899
instance this one from France that is

481
00:28:48,500 --> 00:29:02,390
matching that against the list that i

482
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:06,350
have noticed that china on screen now 33

483
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:10,630
thousand and so on attacks tonight how

484
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:14,120
much the amount of tax can be tonight

485
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:20,300
the civet can take out over here norton

486
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:22,479
TM united states of america on screen

487
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,480
now

488
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:41,870
fifteen thousand 959 attacks nip them

489
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:47,810
from Spain regarding new trends and

490
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:54,939
tendencies regarding new attacks we got

491
00:29:47,810 --> 00:30:00,639
now on screen the spheres moving around

492
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:04,480
the garden on screen check out the ports

493
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:08,140
4.5 I'm receiving many attacks from

494
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:12,200
outside and they configure bottners

495
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:15,440
configure it has this last way over the

496
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:26,630
pad smells it has onboard 23 I committed

497
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:29,440
on before we have 5922 essays these are

498
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:36,580
the types of attacks made recently oh

499
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:38,900
good now now the provider is n finna let

500
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,590
you know the Pearson oils are not

501
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,590
statistics

502
00:30:52,190 --> 00:31:01,650
let's move on to the next point I will

503
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,130
to explain to you the last three latest

504
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,130
cases

505
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:19,080
let's see if we can get on the screen we

506
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,080
got it now

507
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:29,639
the very first case expose devices here

508
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:34,620
they're doing us too soon they attack

509
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:41,240
available equipment from the embedded

510
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:44,100
Linux devices and from SSH age expose

511
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:48,300
assistance divides the distributed

512
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:52,669
malware i will show you some plan once

513
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:56,220
installed they connect with it a say

514
00:31:52,670 --> 00:32:00,480
constantly sending commands over the

515
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:06,300
past years 95,000 events as of today may

516
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:09,600
more 3000 and so different IPS detective

517
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:13,919
there weren't there spain's based

518
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:17,419
reuters involved in this process as we

519
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:20,670
mentioned before we notified the

520
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:27,330
provider of the current program for them

521
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:29,820
to sort it out as soon as possible with

522
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:34,679
IP addresses i obtained from there i

523
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:39,000
analyze them all and I so the many of

524
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:42,450
them had the port 80 open you got them

525
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,350
to sampling from those panels with the

526
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:50,310
body for passwords rude rude so on so

527
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:53,250
depending on the device inside

528
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,710
there's this little sample but I got

529
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:58,680
over 300 different captures and

530
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:03,150
screenshots regarding the sampling i get

531
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:05,690
i got for you we got down on screen it's

532
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:08,430
true imagine that tells you that these

533
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,740
download sampling for different and

534
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:14,130
various architectures and they executed

535
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,220
to get the mall constantly didn't even

536
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:20,310
check out the origin of these

537
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,700
architectures item the mall and one of

538
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:32,820
them will get stuck on that this is the

539
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:36,030
sampling second case by generating gains

540
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:39,740
with quick fraud a sub december last

541
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:46,230
year amazon was involved with so that

542
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:49,460
amazon equipment 30-day trial the fall

543
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:53,790
amazon equipments the villains were

544
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:57,720
infecting exposed league prudential

545
00:33:53,790 --> 00:34:02,310
services one you were bound rated you

546
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,940
move into catwalks and gateways into

547
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:10,710
advertising areas razon noticed that

548
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:13,050
there's a stock of me overnight but back

549
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:17,940
this summer dis campaign appeared again

550
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:19,920
against amazon google so flowering

551
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,900
microsoft as well the greatest and can

552
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,909
pay an attacking you can see the graph

553
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:28,440
now on screen and that the flow chart

554
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:34,460
they proceeded as they did before

555
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:39,240
this can be nice nautic system it's gone

556
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:43,639
last kids when i call the asian attack

557
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:47,428
how the cool in the tag or an attacker

558
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:50,310
with ssh services and your route and

559
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:53,790
when there's and say you are connected

560
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:56,250
with the overs 16 IEP is with the users

561
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:59,029
and powers cuts word this is not very

562
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:02,720
common but this happened the problem is

563
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:05,970
many of these passwords of these devices

564
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:09,470
belong to the Apple devices on TV with

565
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:14,750
helping which were rooted besides other

566
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:14,750
rooters and another remaining devices

567
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:26,910
you can see I pmag passwords that be the

568
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:29,069
most used for Apple devices this is

569
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:32,490
pretty much it this is my contact you

570
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:35,310
can get my inside the email address my

571
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:38,490
personal email address i will be a valid

572

to contact me i will be available now

575
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,390
let's go on to the round of questions

576
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,140
should be interested please raise your

577
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,140
hands thank you

578
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:05,370
ha spectacular great show spectacular

579
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:08,040
presentation well damn job I would like

580
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:11,759
to know do you have a forecast to share

581
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,440
this information alone besides the duo

582
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,470
informants group the military with

583
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,020
companies and enterprises inside we

584
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:22,770
started out with the purpose of helping

585
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:25,620
out the spins companies if an IP address

586
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:28,259
is sending out as many many tasks should

587
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,319
it should be possible for all the

588
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,440
companies to stop that traffic let's

589
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:38,370
mess around with good dear some

590
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,870
fraudsters buy it lets it share that the

591
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,790
information we know the villains share

592
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:46,589
information that I mean there are many

593
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:48,509
more over ass so it's Dutch if we the

594
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:52,890
good people and share information we can

595
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:55,500
be stronger than yes we're going to

596
00:36:52,890 --> 00:37:01,440
share information collected from these

597
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:04,830
sensors any more questions please hello

598
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,090
thank you very much for your nice talk

599
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,090
I'd like to ask you

600
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:16,740
as you do a honey pour the attacker can

601
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:19,080
detect that is on honey pot can you do

602
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,810
in the reverse mode and the other way

603
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:26,299
around honey pot from your network you

604
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:29,520
put some parameter some baits that make

605
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:32,490
thin the attacker that is not an

606
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,120
attacker or but honey but I couldn't

607
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:39,060
hear you I will repeat the question as

608
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:42,839
is feasible to reach a honey port and

609
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:45,930
detect that young honey poor would we

610
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:48,000
have it is visible for us to detect this

611
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:51,240
honey pot can we do it the other way

612
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,280
around with legitimate equipments within

613
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:57,330
your network to make the tackle thing

614
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,590
that this attacker except a honey pot to

615
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:05,970
deceive the attacker and the the

616
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:07,770
attacker will leave a legitimate a quit

617
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:10,799
man by thinking there is another honey

618
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,870
but I didn't think that I didn't come

619
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,590
come up with the point any more

620
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,589
questions over there

621
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:31,960
so we cannot hear the speaker please

622
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:31,960
there is no microphone in years

623
00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:39,460
interpreters cannot hear the speaker

624
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:41,960
because there is no microphone years

625
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:44,599
hello thank you for your nice dog I'd

626
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,630
like to ask you you receive so many

627
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,910
attacks on a honeypot there is any

628
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:52,700
specific methodology to discriminate as

629
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:56,270
some attacks in the pursuit of research

630
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:58,960
needed and how was then this is very

631
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:01,538
first question normally honey port of

632
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:06,049
architecture allows much more

633
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:09,880
interaction we analyze all the

634
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:12,079
organization communication or the the

635
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,240
layout that the attacker did with

636
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,690
admission the more interaction you get

637
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,058
the more information you obtain if you

638
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:23,510
could little interaction little

639
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:29,299
information so but more interaction

640
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:32,390
implies more risks you said before that

641
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:35,059
it should not be activity on a honeypot

642
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,279
the region there should not be a lot of

643
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:39,349
traffic on the honey pot should it

644
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:43,099
should be convenient for us to denied

645
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:44,660
false traffic coming from the workers

646
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:52,960
and high but we can test it we contested

647
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:55,788
we might have to test it thank you hello

648
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,539
where are you I am i spending on

649
00:39:55,789 --> 00:40:05,299
upstairs good afternoon the to the

650
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:09,079
visually very attractive that shown the

651
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:11,630
sean attacks in real time which of them

652
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,599
can be analyzed regarding the level of

653
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:18,740
capacity to discern level of casita

654
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:21,950
citizen Oh criticality to discern which

655
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:25,910
attacks are really critical we should

656
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:28,700
analyze information in individual cases

657
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:30,370
to single out the more important ones

658
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:34,120
the two

659
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:36,460
cannot analyze the level of criticality

660
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:42,210
know it's going to do it but it should

661
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:42,210
we should be a private concert to do so

662
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:54,879
hello we have came here very late so I

663
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:59,860
