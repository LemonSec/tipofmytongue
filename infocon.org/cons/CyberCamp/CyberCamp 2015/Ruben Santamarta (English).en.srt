1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:14,340
104 games are you anyway okay right it

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,740
seems that everything is well set a

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,680
right first of all thank you very much

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:22,830
for being here today I know it is

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,990
lunchtime so it is not an easy time so

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,198
we try to be brief in my presentation

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:32,089
and in the next 40 minutes I'd like you

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,340
to have good times and hopefully we'll

9
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:41,960
be sharing something just for you okay

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:45,059
so well having introduced already so the

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,059
title of my presentation was 21 days and

12
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,050
the reason for that is simple reason the

13
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:55,680
simple reason that I will be shoving off

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:01:02,930
throughout my presentation so 21 days

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:06,840
will the day so the borrowing maximum

16
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:11,430
days that but that you could borrow a

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,070
booking libraries and actually I

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,840
borrowed many many books in the library

19
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:21,479
that have brought me up to what I am

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,770
today with you I don't know whether you

21
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,650
listen two fermions presentation and to

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,970
the presentation of other speakers that

23
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:40,020
have talked before me they told their

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:43,649
story and I found a common thread a

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:48,600
commonality they all had a very early

26
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,970
vocation for computers they started as a

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,179
very young age to play around with

28
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,729
computers they started doing programming

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,210
at the age of six or seven but that was

30
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:03,780
not me let us say that I entry into the

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,690
world of IT security quite late in my

32
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,390
life when I was small I

33
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:13,620
liked and I continue to like to imagine

34
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:16,649
other realities that is to say to find

35
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,130
things that are unusual that are not

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:24,270
ordinary that are kind of out of the box

37
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:26,640
that is to say to imagine reality in

38
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,620
different ways and when I was a small

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,290
instead of playing around with computers

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,720
I used to do drawings to read books to

41
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:39,899
play games anything all that aims at

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:43,050
satisfying in my need at my will to find

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:47,280
magic other realities my first computer

44
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,310
was 286 computer I don't remember the H

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,450
that I was at a time basically i justed

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:57,240
to play games but that was it I just

47
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,060
know whether you can remember recall

48
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,460
this frame do you know the video games

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,760
Fred yes some people know it it's

50
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,430
Indiana Jones Last Crusade this is a

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,840
graphical adventure well we may sound a

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:16,820
bit Oh nonsense okay on me beeping feel

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:21,420
dosis to you but it is a very marked

54
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:24,570
memory in my mind I just to play this

55
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,299
game with Mario bojana Mario Vienna was

56
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:31,109
much more into computers than myself

57
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,840
he's still working on it he is working

58
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,810
in security now he is part of intrepid

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,700
so I'd like to greet him from here and

60
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,120
we just to get together in balance yeah

61
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:46,140
we just to get together just to plot

62
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,220
maps of this game and to analyze it as

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:52,708
much as possible and actually all that

64
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:57,000
gave us lots of learning lots of

65
00:03:52,709 --> 00:04:00,090
learning and but I know how that I used

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,840
later on in life but what is most

67
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,110
important of all is this ok this is the

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,250
public library I come from Leon and I

69
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:14,090
lived in palencia for 20 years

70
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:17,029
most of my time I spent it so most of my

71
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:22,580
life like spent 18 palencia and I would

72
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:28,400
like to call upon journalists and

73
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:31,070
journalists dealing with security to do

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,429
some research about palantir what

75
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:37,370
happened in Valencia very many security

76
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,950
experts were born in Milan fear there

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:43,100
was something in the water of Valencia

78
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:47,060
that made us all become interested in

79
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:49,040
this topic and physically in well

80
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,620
palencia is located in the north of

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,710
Spain functionally speaking we could say

82
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,070
that it is next to Terrell meaning that

83
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:00,500
perhaps you will not hear anything about

84
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:04,370
palencia in the news or anywhere else

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,490
and I'm showing the photographs all of

86
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,280
these library the library of palencia

87
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,020
because when some years ago getting

88
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,989
access to resources was completely

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,780
different and then now internet is

90
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,060
strongly developed it is very easy to

91
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,979
get access to any resource validities

92
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:27,620
papers books PDFs you name it but when i

93
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:30,159
started in all these worlds i was 13 or

94
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,550
14 years of age and accessing resources

95
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,430
was not easy was not as easy as it is

96
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:41,060
today at that time I didn't have an

97
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,580
internet connection I was not in the

98
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:47,470
underground groups or anything like that

99
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,659
I was much more normal ordinary

100
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:55,220
standards so to speak I was not seen to

101
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:57,910
those world world or group but but I did

102
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,130
was just to read as much as possible

103
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,440
well I'd like to give you a piece of

104
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,510
advice okay it is not that you have to

105
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,580
do it but I'd like to advise you to read

106
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,870
as much as possible if you're reading

107
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,719
something that you don't understand

108
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,419
don't you worry at a given point in time

109
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,060
you will understand to get get to

110
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:18,260
understand that that you did not

111
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,260
understand at a time when you read it

112
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,269
for the first time and when you wonder

113
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,058
what is

114
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:29,329
but will that do for me well if you look

115
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:32,179
at it so in the long term it will pay

116
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:34,459
off read as much as possible and I

117
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:37,429
remember you know someone said that to

118
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:41,139
me sure to go and that web person was

119
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:44,328
very much right so 21 days was the

120
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:46,189
amount of time you could borrow a book

121
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:50,269
and there was also a limited number of

122
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:52,219
books at the library and at that time in

123
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:55,069
that library all the books that i

124
00:06:52,219 --> 00:07:00,039
borrowed allowed me to set the basis to

125
00:06:55,069 --> 00:07:04,899
understand what later on would become a

126
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:08,659
topic of research and study and the

127
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:11,569
field i were working i used to perl

128
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:13,579
programming books aight ebooks i learn

129
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,799
how to program how to understand

130
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:19,579
programming i started to do c

131
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:24,888
programming to understand how a computer

132
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:26,689
worked inside and that was one of the

133
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:33,949
things that allowed me to satisfy my

134
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:37,009
need to find unusual things that were

135
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:40,429
out of the box so by having this

136
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:42,979
knowledge in PA is everybody access them

137
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:45,649
I wanted ready to access this knowledge

138
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:49,519
I want to highlight how important is

139
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:52,189
that every human being has to be able to

140
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:55,969
access knowledge that's a must otherwise

141
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:59,110
we will be denying everybody the

142
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:03,829
possibility of develop as a human being

143
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:08,509
their interest and so on I want to thank

144
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:12,019
the libraries for their support thank

145
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:14,749
you I thank that all public resources

146
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:19,009
libraries for having given me so much

147
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:21,979
knowledge this far are you familiar with

148
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:24,829
this does it sounds good to you can you

149
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:28,380
recognize this screenshot from what

150
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:32,150
program does it come from now don't

151
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:37,679
this belong to a soft light program

152
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:40,140
which is a purifier purifier in use very

153
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,079
well used and back in in their epic when

154
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:48,540
it comes to cracking I started as a

155
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:52,560
cracker crackers sometimes I usually

156
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:56,310
read articles or thus crackers are those

157
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:00,900
people who messed around assistant they

158
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:03,689
broke it the lid did in such a way cry

159
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,730
the definition about crackers crackers

160
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,760
worse we're supposed to be the bad

161
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,790
hackers perhaps yes perhaps net but

162
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,520
within this world crackers studied there

163
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:19,160
and research the software protections

164
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:25,670
they conducted reverse engineering and

165
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:31,110
serial numbers to be registering your

166
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:32,370
product they pop up it was the window

167
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,840
you have to reduce you have to register

168
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:41,630
by changing just got you can you can

169
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:44,280
read off of the program so the assembler

170
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,980
didn't sound arena cracker I learned

171
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:51,270
this so much from people who publish

172
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:54,390
this knowledge we feedback from people's

173
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:57,689
knowledge from other resources we found

174
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,250
in the library a source of information

175
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,030
and learn is what the community

176
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:05,190
published back at the time I was at the

177
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,470
learning I learned so much from the

178
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,890
community and I had the feeling that

179
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:16,770
what I learned it has to be uploaded

180
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:23,370
widespread disseminated carpet Spanish

181
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:26,520
to Tim had so so many incredibly huge

182
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,950
amount of tutorials were stood by step

183
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,290
they talked to us how to break a

184
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:35,130
software protection in a very detail way

185
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:38,949
if I had to think carbon a turning point

186
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:43,030
in my trajectory as I assume

187
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:44,770
computer person i would suggest and I

188
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:48,040
would highlight that by working with

189
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:50,050
these tutorials manuals as to crack him

190
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,589
super protection would be that the

191
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:58,719
remarkable theme the Reno remarkable ice

192
00:10:53,590 --> 00:11:02,530
album of them made people from them all

193
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:08,290
school that all legacy remind remember

194
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:10,510
it okay I use it to do in Tumblr's so

195
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,329
there are so many books some resources

196
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,420
online please don't live it then leave

197
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:19,840
it aside in the bookshelves Dustin dance

198
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,030
up there was a time in which searching

199
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,890
for this information looking for this

200
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:28,920
information was a hacking consider fact

201
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:33,630
so far so good a certain moment in time

202
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:37,120
when I was about 16 17 years oh I

203
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:39,430
stopped doing this thing I left can beat

204
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,660
the security other side and got involved

205
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:47,949
in different issues I I did a post in my

206
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:50,170
life but of course a certain moment I'm

207
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:55,060
I decided about my life what can I do

208
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:59,410
with my life before before entering into

209
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:04,180
being a malware analyst I was sending

210
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:07,510
out my CB for the wal mart supermarket

211
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:10,209
sm butcher of corbin butcher is a

212
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:13,830
respectable joblessness that's worthy as

213
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,320
mine but i would like to mention this

214
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:19,960
for you to see my friends that as if a

215
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,480
certain moment I'm you have chosen a

216
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,120
different but it has anything to do with

217
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,340
competing security it's never too late

218
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:33,390
when you are gonna get good things you

219
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:36,370
only need working interests and effort

220
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:41,500
that's the truth you cannot get this

221
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:44,830
overnight you need many hours you need

222
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,740
to spend so many hours sitting around

223
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,480
the computer

224
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,529
awake so you're reading you're

225
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,870
practicing something you realize you're

226
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:58,140
passionate about it so in such a way

227
00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:01,050
this make up for the effort invested but

228
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:04,020
it's true that is a hard job being a

229
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:09,959
malware analyst but is worth trying it

230
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:12,199
so I i opted for this path what can I do

231
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:15,959
very few things I didn't have him

232
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,940
university degree I started going to the

233
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:19,859
University for the sake of it but I

234
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:25,920
wasn't very interested in the University

235
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:30,570
so in the very end what in my child

236
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,880
years was hobby allows me now conduct my

237
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,029
own profession and career I knew how to

238
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,000
do inverse and reverse engineering

239
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:42,330
knowledge I got when I was a younger so

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,630
I started working in an antivirus

241
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:48,360
company when I learned so much from seen

242
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:53,040
different types of troy ounce malware

243
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:56,940
this allowed me to learn a lot at the

244
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,829
end of the day that's a given moment in

245
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:05,790
time I created my own enterprise because

246
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:07,620
something funny happened to me and why

247
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,050
is stay in front of the computer and

248
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:16,130
going through windows files i discovered

249
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:20,550
the chain is sadhu shadow shadow shadow

250
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:24,209
community file shadow what's that it

251
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:27,000
struck my attention seeing this a chain

252
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:30,770
and a Microsoft fire I opened it with

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,930
the disin sample I did reverse in

254
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:36,959
engineering this driver the variant I

255
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:40,199
found the vulnerability of this driver

256
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,380
that allowed me to scale up on the

257
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:46,560
privilege is not on all windows releases

258
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,200
it was a surprise for me to see that I

259
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,649
didn't I didn't when I didn't go into

260
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,800
that in so I won't micros about this

261
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:57,880
failure this bag

262
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:01,740
so by reading book trap one I saw an

263
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:05,230
email from company by the Negev defense

264
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,110
but the baton of the email i will pay

265
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,390
you for your backs for your

266
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:13,240
vulnerabilities can i be paid for

267
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:16,209
discovering this manner adidas bag of

268
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,329
course i contacted them I got this

269
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:22,390
vanilla team but I warn Microsoft about

270
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:26,170
that are you still interested of course

271
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:30,880
we are we're very interested a lot so

272
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:35,579
they bought my vulnerability wow this is

273
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:41,500
this one day job allows me to be 30 days

274
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:46,290
after being trunk while and quiet so

275
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:51,660
let's look at it this been down the next

276
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:54,279
five to four years I bought it myself to

277
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,290
exploring companies buying

278
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,980
vulnerabilities I found vulnerabilities

279
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:03,339
this was a perfect plan I didn't mount a

280
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:09,300
company per se but I was sitting around

281
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:09,300
my computer without many many

282
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,250
restlessness and I dove into the

283
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:18,550
software the companies were interested

284
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:27,310
in buying operating system can be found

285
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:33,310
on Microsoft systems prison it was good

286
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:37,270
for me thank God I made a living and I

287
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:39,279
learned so much because for for us to

288
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:43,779
discover bernardi you need to understand

289
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:47,829
how systems work at a very low level so

290
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:50,380
this served to me it was very useful as

291
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:53,579
to understanding that many technologies

292
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:56,980
work and I gained so much experience

293
00:16:53,579 --> 00:17:02,069
from many other subjects matters and

294
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:05,539
walks of lives afterwards along with

295
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:10,039
friend of my gap gabriel gonzalez from

296
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:15,169
a friend of a friend a long time long

297
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:20,118
live friend I'd real you may know him in

298
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:23,629
the computing world if you are no

299
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:26,089
they're in this computing world when you

300
00:17:23,628 --> 00:17:29,178
know these people you can see you can

301
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:31,908
tell they are brilliant they had a

302
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:35,149
little effort doing the job but there's

303
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:37,220
they're also computing people who are

304
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:39,439
not very special we are devoted

305
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,639
ourselves into this lies with more or

306
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,609
less ever but we can do things properly

307
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:50,119
like four million cells before geniuses

308
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:51,949
have come through this stage but there

309
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:55,899
is an important thing to make it clear

310
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:59,059
everybody can devote himself to the

311
00:17:55,899 --> 00:18:02,119
cybersecurity as it takes time and

312
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:05,239
effort period I don't have a university

313
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:11,289
degree and I'm on stage presenting my

314
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:14,509
paypal so we set up a company start up

315
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:18,259
there is that we are in the fashion of a

316
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:23,629
started with entrepreneurs I got to know

317
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:26,690
how this world works and we were a big

318
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:30,639
innocent naive in this regard after one

319
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:33,739
year from sitting of this company we

320
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:37,998
accumulated lesbians and we shut down

321
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:41,840
our company sometimes that the logos on

322
00:18:37,999 --> 00:18:47,090
linkedin the postings if you fail try it

323
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:50,019
again for the 24 times and you'll get a

324
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:52,699
success up there many times and

325
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:54,999
intelligence is being able to adapt

326
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,419
yourself to reality if you had tried

327
00:18:54,999 --> 00:19:02,059
something 24 times and you didn't get it

328
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:05,149
you may only be considering that perhaps

329
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:09,649
is not your feel of action you should

330
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:11,809
move on into different area so it didn't

331
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,610
work my company didn't work I can

332
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:17,899
experience but I didn't work

333
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:22,699
why should I be here in my startup so

334
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:26,110
let's face the facts perhaps a company

335
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:34,100
is not something I should do period

336
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:36,169
during this time 2010-2011 I started

337
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,469
being interested in the industrial

338
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:42,140
control control systems I fascinated

339
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:45,559
about the capacity that you can have

340
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,690
from a computer to affect the real world

341
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,139
which is something the assistants deal

342
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:57,110
with I was totally fascinated with scale

343
00:19:51,140 --> 00:20:02,080
systems nuclear station controlling

344
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:07,129
systems or power station systems

345
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,559
physical station so I put myself in

346
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,580
doing reverse engineering with the

347
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:16,668
firmware and software on these devices

348
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:19,580
controlling these devices and the

349
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:23,330
system's themselves another turning

350
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:27,770
point in my trajectory was the base camp

351
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:32,139
roof project created by an American

352
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:35,090
company we were contacted as in

353
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,900
researches each net we love you will be

354
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:42,580
given a device as you can see on screen

355
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:47,049
and that's really control the files and

356
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:50,629
you will get one way to try to break it

357
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:55,460
you'll not have to write down a report

358
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:57,049
and the findings sound and the

359
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:01,549
volunteers has to be presented to us

360
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:03,660
anything you have fun I was sent this

361
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:07,290
device of

362
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:10,350
and I connected on making my house I

363
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:13,310
apply the methodology I put in place for

364
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:16,709
these things I look for information

365
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,659
controlling and super control in this

366
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:21,680
device the reverse engineering of this

367
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,330
over to understand the critical in use

368
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:28,260
to do reverse engineering up with

369
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:30,330
firmware which is the specific software

370
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:35,370
running through the specific coding

371
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:37,560
inside this device the truth is I was

372
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:43,379
very surprised I discovered so many

373
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:47,550
things inside the rose design at this

374
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:51,690
time failure but goes totally insecure

375
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:55,290
that allowed to take the control take

376
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:58,770
over from these device into to leave it

377
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:03,389
aside out of order so this kind of

378
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:07,050
device is controlling every day physical

379
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:10,590
fans every day when we get up in the

380
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:12,960
morning and we switch on the light what

381
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:16,169
is working our everyday life having hot

382
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,590
water the gas supply is controlled by

383
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:22,200
these mechanisms I was very very

384
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:24,929
surprised about the lack of security of

385
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,670
these devices by taking into account how

386
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,980
important the things are in good control

387
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:33,210
oneself but by themselves so i'm going

388
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:36,740
to show you now a video let's see if i

389
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,740
can show you

390
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:58,470
aquila weighs 10 and este caso locust

391
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,990
R&B emulous around after day packages

392
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:05,560
Here I am standing specific ethernet IP

393
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:10,600
protocol packages which is using this

394
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:16,120
device it was by default insecure when I

395
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:19,540
presented the results you can see I i

396
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,719
put it out of order and you cannot you

397
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,870
cannot connect to this device at all the

398
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:31,920
the software running through stop

399
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:37,629
working so I presented this project and

400
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:42,250
it has a lot of repetition backrub tine

401
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:47,490
fit leather Cerullo he's a legendary

402
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:52,930
hacker from Argentina contacted me and

403
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:56,650
offered me to join io active was very

404
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:59,110
very very powerfully renown in the

405
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:03,730
hacking world is made up of hackers an

406
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:08,699
American company on one side I was

407
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,700
really really emotion Oh

408
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:13,870
fascinate about getting into this

409
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:16,689
company joining this company I was about

410
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:22,149
to learn so many things but on the other

411
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:25,299
side I was I panicked I panicked but but

412
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:29,889
at the time I panic about flying on the

413
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:32,019
plane has had a terrible english i was i

414
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:35,590
panic about communicating myself in

415
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:37,809
english I panic about not communicating

416
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:41,259
myself in the in the way wheel they

417
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:43,779
expect from me I panic person after

418
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:46,509
being hired I went to the state for

419
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:49,120
three months thanks to a person which is

420
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:52,870
in the audience otherwise I would have

421
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:57,008
stared out of state in the bed because

422
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:59,350
it was spook it was scary to move on in

423
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:04,269
there without knowing what was waiting

424
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:06,399
for me so unfortunately something that

425
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:09,190
we need to get through after four years

426
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:13,779
I still working in Iraq you I stopped

427
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:19,000
having fear about planes I'm getting

428
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:22,360
bored many flames so this plane fear has

429
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,049
vanished into thin air are you a plane

430
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,870
here people there's no a magical recipe

431
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:31,389
space will people fly and they will tell

432
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:35,139
you about her experience I'm start with

433
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:36,639
Jim about their fear to fly and she

434
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:38,439
might reported me there are sperience is

435
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:40,750
on the plains and this helped me out a

436
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,179
lot because when you are on the plane

437
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:46,080
you know this is normal thing you are

438
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:49,750
not going to die on the plane so I I

439
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,730
hear noise in the blend oh the wings are

440
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,740
moving I'm going to die I'm about to die

441
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:56,980
that's what that's what would happen to

442
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:59,409
me back at a time so I'm speaking

443
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,620
English much better you know that in

444
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:05,470
Spain we have a tremendous deficit which

445
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,899
english we have trouble speaking english

446
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,509
we lack confidence and Spaniards about

447
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:14,018
speaking good English so we had trouble

448
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:15,429
with come from our shelves with us would

449
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:19,539
make it ourself understandable in

450
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:22,690
English we need to disinhibitor

451
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:27,700
ourselves so I visited so many countries

452
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:31,180
I saw so many people so many different

453
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,780
cultures it's very important to voters

454
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:37,330
up to the security well which is now

455
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:39,730
globalized so if you're working on this

456
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:43,000
cybersecurity world you're going to meet

457
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:46,150
new people and new places with anecdotes

458
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,410
we go to the India and India shake the

459
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:54,340
hand is weight means yes and not know at

460
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:59,560
trouble in some countries when spelling

461
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:02,800
a line when I met and they shake they

462
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,770
shake their their head this way and I

463
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,430
thought okay that they're saying and no

464
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:11,230
but it was a yes so so you're in

465
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:15,400
situations that you never thought of

466
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:18,360
before I remember sometimes I was

467
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:24,690
invited to a conference in Washington

468
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:27,610
suddenly I was there with the c.i.a a

469
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:31,630
director I never thought myself in with

470
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:35,919
the CIA eight main head oh my god I

471
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:38,140
picture myself or what the hell am i

472
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:42,340
doing in front of the big officer from

473
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:44,380
the c.i.a so this big experience is

474
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,230
teaching you so much throughout your

475
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:49,660
life and you always remember them with

476
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:52,270
pleasure and make make yourself advance

477
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:57,580
into new challenges I was lucky enough

478
00:27:52,270 --> 00:28:02,200
to that Gabi after T years join I owe

479
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:04,780
acted capriole joined us Winterkorn

480
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,320
didn't work but sometimes life keeps

481
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,780
your second opportunity I owe activists

482
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,970
not our own company but its accompanying

483
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:17,260
we are happily working there this is a

484
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:19,600
picture we took in Dubai we went in to

485
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:23,190
the buy for project and we were monkey

486
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:28,560
around there as we did in palencia

487
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:31,590
we were working a lot I have them lucky

488
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:34,710
enough to work with people with friends

489
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:37,889
or some remarkable thing for instance

490
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:41,490
one other thing that we do in Iowa

491
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:43,830
active is to research we like breaking

492
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:46,290
thien's to root research do you know

493
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:52,470
what is this what is this you can seen

494
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:56,990
on screen now you know this is some this

495
00:28:52,470 --> 00:29:00,150
is a tamper bills detector used in the

496
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:04,700
supermarket and the main stores courting

497
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:09,270
glass the post office this is this

498
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:14,310
detector out false bills note so these

499
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:17,520
devices can be hacked as well so we got

500
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:22,169
around that we with a simple piece of

501
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:25,530
paper we modify it we tampered with this

502
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:29,940
info specifically as a valid beeler node

503
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:32,280
and certain person by planning but into

504
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,800
the serial port of this device can

505
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:39,379
update the firmware without any kind of

506
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:42,840
insecurities so let's watch a video

507
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:47,030
where we can check out this as a

508
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:50,340
feasible theme this is a legitimate

509
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:54,149
100,000 euros beer let's see what

510
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:57,080
happens it that does it take it as a

511
00:29:54,150 --> 00:30:00,360
valid it took it as a valid build my god

512
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:04,439
with a very simple modification up the

513
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,990
fem worm in this device detector times

514
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,410
life goes around and run syrup so we

515
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:13,080
talk about that hackers talent has to go

516
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:16,380
outside spain abroad like living in

517
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:19,830
spain for me success is to do my job

518
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,220
properly come back home and having beers

519
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:24,240
with a person i want to share my life

520
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,540
human being has to define what success

521
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,210
is for the birds on big expectations ok

522
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:33,360
to somewhat limited by the wood don't

523
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,220
fall into the feeling of defeat

524
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,459
everybody has to define what success

525
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:41,790
means for you my friend success is what

526
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:46,350
I'm now doing with my life so something

527
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:49,220
while ago I was told of from my company

528
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:53,580
if I told me that they decided to open

529
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:56,100
laboratory inventory after moving around

530
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:59,520
many many countries in the very end I

531
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:02,850
was happy enough to bring over Spain the

532
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:06,450
things i learned outside spain abroad so

533
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:09,480
the good people in spain can work can

534
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:11,760
work here in their own country spain

535
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,830
very close to their loved ones where

536
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,040
they were born this is failing to a

537
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:20,070
system of obviously the one who wants to

538
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,250
go abroad is has the right and settled

539
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:25,710
to do so but going abroad as an

540
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:28,260
obligation is not recommended but it's

541
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:31,290
not the optimal things so we open a

542
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:34,980
laboratory of a harvard laboratory

543
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:39,120
imagery and for us it was very important

544
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:40,830
because phrases the graffiti you can see

545
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,270
now on the screen was done by somebody

546
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:49,500
from palencia with whom I was drawing in

547
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:52,889
the very and live always and said being

548
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:57,030
in the very same circles I was I was

549
00:31:52,890 --> 00:32:01,429
passionate about working seen people

550
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:06,740
that are good with me happily ever after

551
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:09,780
along with their loved ones our idea is

552
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,820
to continue this way the very same

553
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:14,639
things we do in in the United States we

554
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,990
have to apply it in Spain we have the

555
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,230
means we have the people we have the

556
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:22,200
resources we can bring back over all

557
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,120
this talent into spam and we can move

558
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,760
forward and put for all these things

559
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,309
together very little happen I have the

560
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:33,240
same I think that each and every of ours

561
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:36,120
is old enough to know how to lead their

562
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,070
lives I don't try to set an example I

563
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:42,270
don't want to give lessons to anybody

564
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:44,700
but please respect you have to have

565
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:49,620
respect let's respect

566
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:53,160
hackers sometimes developers are Villa

567
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:55,050
pandya it did when you find a

568
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:59,720
vulnerability and they say oh you got a

569
00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:03,149
back problem let's be humble let's try

570
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,890
to look for the middle turn that did the

571
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,170
greatest scale of colors let's respect

572
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,950
respect everybody everybody in this

573
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:13,560
competing world in security has a job

574
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:16,950
with the different scenarios best

575
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:20,580
scenarios worse case scenarios don't

576
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:24,000
take assumptions as for granted the

577
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:26,100
hacker in the hacker culture there are

578
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,470
many egoistic people there is a lot of

579
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:32,280
ego among hackers we huggers are human

580
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:35,550
beings we are not normal everyday we are

581
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:39,090
the common guy we should not be feel

582
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:42,210
ourselves superior to the others and to

583
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:44,939
believe in the age and disdain others

584
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:47,580
people's job let's be humble I said so

585
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,010
many times I saw that the all

586
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:53,610
generations a sense of superiority

587
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:56,300
please stop being egoistic leave Diego

588
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:59,520
and study be happy working and

589
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:02,850
respecting the rest of the people this

590
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,800
is state should have any questions in

591
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,330
particular please I would be very happy

592
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,950
to answer thank you very much for your

593
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,699
time and how will all see you next time

594
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,699
thank you

595
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:29,418
hola hello I want to ask you two

596
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:34,879
questions very first question what can I

597
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:36,739
start to be a good developer I guess at

598
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,808
this moment it depends on what you want

599
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:41,029
you to program that's all you want to

600
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:43,369
create if you want to create web based

601
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:46,119
sisters you may not need to be an

602
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:49,369
assembler if you want to program

603
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,440
embedded systems very firstly you have

604
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:53,829
to understand how the system works at a

605
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,960
very low level otherwise it would be

606
00:34:53,829 --> 00:35:00,799
impossible to do so and you will drag

607
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:05,599
out a lack of knowledge that can be a

608
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:08,420
burden and us in every day developer I

609
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,730
you have to analyze the thing you like

610
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,559
the most let's target something you like

611
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:16,069
for is in a mobile application I want to

612
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:19,700
program a web-based service based upon

613
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:22,190
that study the technology applicable to

614
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:26,089
that upon what you want to develop the

615
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:28,880
technology and less delve into that as

616
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:31,190
much as possible be as detailed as

617
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,549
possible to confront any problems and is

618
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:36,829
your issues when programming because

619
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,069
there are sound data sheets that are

620
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:41,210
very simple to dip into the program

621
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:44,930
there are texts that are very simple you

622
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:47,329
can develop easily mmm creative all

623
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:49,190
programs but you when you confront a

624
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:51,170
problem when you face a probe a problem

625
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,900
you are not prepared for it you will

626
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:56,029
suffer a lack of knowledge if let's

627
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,390
focus on a specific technology and what

628
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,390
forward

629
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,470
how can I be a good cracker took how can

630
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,649
I do to be a cracker very first bit is

631
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,629
in Samba need to in sample sample and

632
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,880
the machine code when I can I learn the

633
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,800
machine coding oh so in many books many

634
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,980
bugs there are so many books you can

635
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,980
collect about the in sampling all the

636
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,890
tutorials guidelines manuals are in the

637
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,660
internet us to resources you'll you'll

638
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,240
get so many resources if you don't want

639
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:35,580
to go to a library in got to the

640
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,709
internet with just a global library

641
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,970
you'll get as much as you need to learn

642
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:43,560
to develop your career and to make a

643
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:56,899
good living out of this is something

644
00:36:43,560 --> 00:37:01,230
super giddim fun for us all our winners

645
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:05,490
hello my question is is it worth going

646
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:08,880
to the University or as studying cell

647
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:11,759
totally or is worth doing official

648
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,040
courses yes yes yes somebody who has

649
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,790
studied at university degree always

650
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:20,910
means that it's able to the distance of

651
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:23,670
course if you have had the mental

652
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:28,109
capacity that the willpower and the

653
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:30,830
sacrifice to a study in a 40 three-year

654
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:34,860
degree which is not easy at all and you

655
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:36,960
got it I think that if you devote

656
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,750
yourself to the cybersecurity and by

657
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,670
applying what you learn from school the

658
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:47,940
cultures it will come through smoothly
