of you to meet outsourced batters and

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,950
less will start about this cyber

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,890
security cyber security is distracted to

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:55,079
only one year ago it's a cool thing but

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:57,329
with short time 05 of the better hackers

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,359
in spain's launched an online show focus

19
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,969
nitey security a few years later they

20
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,010
change radio for GV and discovery

21
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,530
channel put its eyes on them this is

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,390
covering Mac's now they perform the only

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,390
computer security TV show in the world

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:21,140
welcome to Monday rocky Roe hacker the

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,140
world of the hackers

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,980
dubin by internal ram is one of the most

27
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:30,580
recognized hackers and span and south

28
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:33,070
america by his side a team composed by

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,630
university teachers security books

30
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:40,570
authors and ethical hackers trainers

31
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,250
they show and teach how to prevent the

32
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,399
main current cyber attacks around the

33
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:48,790
world they show how governments and

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,860
institutions make a spy on you they

35
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,050
could even compromise almost any IT

36
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,890
infrastructure they held the police to

37
00:01:53,050 --> 00:02:00,330
resolve cyber crimes laceup or armies to

38
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:05,100
train cyber soldiers they are hackers

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,100
mundo hacker expect us

40
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:40,099
I wonder hacker next season coming soon

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:43,130
so far so good I wanna do Shh I want to

42
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:45,140
show you this no not now on discovery

43
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,470
channel is gonna be on the Spanish TV

44
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:53,029
this can mean februari the next station

45
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:55,819
of mundo hacker my friends I couldn't

46
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,650
refrain myself from st. suffer make this

47
00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:01,220
big announcement but this is me this is

48
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,950
me making announcements before I should

49
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,200
so I want to share with you this is

50
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:09,140
going to demystify the made of new

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,500
scenarios in first on cybersecurity I'm

52
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,779
not coming here to talk with you about

53
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,450
hacking where because I know us been at

54
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:21,400
least eight hours a day spending on

55
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:23,209
testing hacker orbs or practicing

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,160
vulnerabilities Assessors I don't have

57
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:27,470
to teach many things to many of my

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,790
students they could think that a student

59
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,340
see things better than that their

60
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:34,310
teacher which means that either you are

61
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,220
great with teacher or and you suck you

62
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:40,190
are not an imbecile or an idiot I want

63
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,459
to display about metal exploit it

64
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,980
explore are there are so many causes

65
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:49,000
manuals tutorials on YouTube you can get

66
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,920
so much in about meta might exploit

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,319
people working that our field dab of

68
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,869
seeing the scenarios managing this

69
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,220
choose I don't have too much to say

70
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:06,799
about it much less about a filthy filthy

71
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:11,510
the father's father's the famous 0 of 3

72
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:14,120
i'm gonna be paid 300 years and i'm no

73
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:17,599
one hand 1000 euros and somebody will be

74
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,260
paid 1 million one minute here after

75
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,930
working as a day lon on Father's I'm

76
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,599
gonna compete on a computer bath I'm a

77
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,450
math teacher I'm not working very well

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,490
within some Boing pieces into a computer

79
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,430
and not an engineer when I talk about

80
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:39,590
big data big data the biggest hard on

81
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:42,470
existing frame the year of the beginning

82
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,859
of the world big day term the models in

83
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,080
use learn

84
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,919
she is as they say I cannot talk about

85
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,229
that because many people are using these

86
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:58,409
big leader models are working properly I

87
00:04:52,229 --> 00:05:02,219
have to demystify that it on big data we

88
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:05,599
got learning machines the machines learn

89
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:11,270
themselves this is a lie dor-win

90
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:15,930
said it I got a big dated to 1994 where

91
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:18,150
we can see almost happening with writing

92
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,599
machine with over start it's not money

93
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:24,090
talking about they talking about

94
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:27,349
analysis of the discriminating the

95
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:30,150
theory of grass logistic regression

96
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:32,699
multivariable regression these are the

97
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,340
really learning machines as of today

98
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:40,620
these models existed take it back from

99
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:43,258
doreen area when when Darwin found a

100
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,889
species in the jungle opinion on that

101
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:49,349
the petrol the size of the flower this

102
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,659
this flowers were subject to this models

103
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,878
and make figured out if this flower

104
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:59,159
animal belong to one species are other

105
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:02,789
in the exchange talk prediction models

106
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:08,009
or exponential jams predicted the exact

107
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:11,310
exchange movements no no this is not no

108
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:14,839
not new this is not mutual what it would

109
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:18,060
that exists is the capacity of computing

110
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:24,180
outcome making computes instead am

111
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:27,060
managing 100 registers we can manage 1

112
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,969
million euros the the registers in real

113
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,819
time this is marvelous didn't big data

114
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:35,539
but the thing of predicting the future

115
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:38,879
seeing things contrasting with learning

116
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:41,969
models is not newest it's common is

117
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,680
belonging belongs to the legacy so be

118
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:46,889
patient with me please my friends

119
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,930
because I a spear a quickly I'm not a

120
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,510
rude person but it is I'm very open and

121
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,460
straightforward person

122
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,550
hacker everybody now wants to be a

123
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,469
hacker by the way this women's

124
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,780
specialists in computing the hacker has

125
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,520
to be correct and politically incorrect

126
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,450
you have just had to be politically

127
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,909
incorrect incorrect you girls is the way

128
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:12,650
I'm I'm politically incorrect and I urge

129
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:17,120
you to be politically incorrect oh this

130
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:22,070
is awesome loud what the is

131
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:25,460
this is the glad thing hotmail economy

132
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:29,270
was based on glad rapidshare was also

133
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,859
cloud-based what's the cloud the real

134
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,039
world works in a different way there is

135
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:39,530
a type there's a guy having an excellent

136
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:43,760
datacenter trading on nasdaq the his

137
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:48,500
company is worth 1000 millions or as

138
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:51,050
what can I do with the my extra free

139
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:54,710
space in my digits enter so I mess up

140
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,280
the cloud it's like I'm a data cloud

141
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:01,070
because I had extra money my money

142
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:05,000
somebody from ftp hotmail Gmail rapid

143
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:07,640
shirt Dave flooded with me love concerts

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,760
the cloud is the bomb sure my goodness I

145
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,909
said is the bomb because cloud is

146
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,789
working because God is dates back to 50

147
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:20,980
years ago all this so-called suppose

148
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:24,050
concept are born to lies cybersecurity

149
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:32,990
impervious Maltese monitoring this is

150
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:36,080
the dream of cloudless put forward is 20

151
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:40,640
years ago when this pattern on screen

152
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,780
was very simple there were two visitors

153
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,510
on website sending out email I'm an old

154
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:52,850
person you got an email I got an email

155
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:55,250
to the years ago EML guy

156
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:59,190
I I was so surprised by the time but

157
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:02,680
this morning I got within 100 EMS

158
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,600
that sending off Amos was controllable

159
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,489
in terms of security because tempest was

160
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,820
not that complex the stone was a

161
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,700
starting 20 years ago as it happens

162
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,810
usually we move at breakneck speed and

163
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:21,310
we come from an environment that within

164
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:23,380
the past and back mmm to the years is

165
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:28,300
changing constantly under talking about

166
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:30,700
them to centres ago so my laptop talks

167
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,339
with the bank in the banking goes to the

168
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:37,480
telly there the teletag with the

169
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,990
verification in Miami and my friends are

170
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:44,440
chatting through what's up with somebody

171
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:47,290
if there is a guy here understanding how

172
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,620
this awesome thing what please

173
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:53,530
explain to me spell it out this is

174
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,650
absolutely impossible for us understand

175
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:59,260
we are managing plots and fragments of

176
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:02,339
knowledge brand new frequency Wi-Fi

177
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:06,430
ready ready ready frequency data centers

178
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:08,920
connectivities network pieces and chunks

179
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,229
of knowledge but the thing we messed

180
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,860
around with over the past 20 years

181
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:18,130
nobody has the remote is the slightest

182
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:23,560
 idea this is matrix going on

183
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:27,850
really we are we are we through evolving

184
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:31,689
to 100 years back in a short time of 20

185
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:35,320
years in a very short time only short 10

186
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:39,010
module this is is untreatable is

187
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:42,460
unfeasible we cannot manage we created a

188
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:45,280
real matrix living matrix on this planet

189
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,010
how can I explain this to my children

190
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,140
when I explain this to my children with

191
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,350
gloves this major sky will die on a

192
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:56,830
video game so I started seeing the

193
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,960
maximum fam this this is the bombshell

194
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:02,320
this is the closeness this is the

195
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:05,170
categorization of digital threads in the

196
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,240
intensity and approximation this data

197
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,360
made up to be honest I'm a

198
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,740
up yes guy because by appointment can

199
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:20,270
bear with everything my friends I

200
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:22,160
started to swim office having a customer

201
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:26,329
inclined a big confession this appliance

202
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,010
make toast it was a good commercial seed

203
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,250
person what can you tell can you tell

204
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:34,069
you of course temperature that you that

205
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:37,100
this appliance reaches allows you to

206
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:40,100
have toes every single day if you put

207
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,770
the bread and that is its smoke steam

208
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,010
lincoln call you Superman you can draw

209
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:49,490
lines on PowerPoint and you do this you

210
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:56,779
put marks and you reach the planet Mars

211
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:59,000
of course this way me myself it's like

212
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:02,240
an awesome I will tell the computers

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,800
I've lived through that I make I'm

214
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,630
making a living out of cabbage but the

215
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:11,689
I'd made up I made it up this malware

216
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:18,020
delicious software the virus if at the

217
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:20,690
small ball a soccer ball the two 1980s

218
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:24,050
safe vision is not bad fishing is a

219
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:26,920
human medicine ape and monkey this is

220
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:31,120
the one falling into the fishing

221
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:36,189
penetration hacking networks a

222
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:39,920
non-secure code attacks mobile attacks

223
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:44,600
this is a turret travel terrible

224
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:48,880
panorama table worst-case scenario oh my

225
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:52,520
god apt was that advanced persistent

226
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:56,660
threat advanced persistent this is

227
00:12:52,520 --> 00:13:00,319
 spic e is like premium gold

228
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,839
investment I would invest on that I put

229
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,089
my backs on that but it is if it's not

230
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,940
advanced persistent threat it could be

231
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:12,320
very careful be they be afraid of bad

232
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:14,720
and the National Cyber Security against

233
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,300
threats plans much more heist it's

234
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,360
working this is a real live show my

235
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:26,399
friends this is a life cycle of birth

236
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,950
system add tag advance against us we

237
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,589
have to recognize the target advance

238
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,779
first we have to drink on it we have to

239
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:36,690
reckon recognized to wreck on the attack

240
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,450
we had to exploit the Ballard is the

241
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,970
system is compromised recognized and the

242
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:45,209
boundary's did the among the positioning

243
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:48,350
on this compromised system this is

244
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:52,050
superb awesome you have been monitored

245
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:56,120
there is there is that means traitors

246
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,120
are behind you the locks are better

247
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:04,410
scaling privily is out in windows are

248
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,490
consistent but it's difficult to just

249
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,839
scaled privilege and linux internal

250
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,810
recognition you start knowing who is

251
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,510
behind you on the network lateral muchos

252
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,300
you're jumping from one mission to the

253
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:20,850
persistency we have to be permanent we

254
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,439
have to remain it's a scythe is a cyber

255
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,110
defense attack we are doing

256
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:29,519
cyber-espionage of tension information

257
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:32,570
we steal information from X filter

258
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:36,720
information this is the bomb show and

259
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:39,750
permanence or end up the mission oh ma

260
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,089
this is awesome this guy is

261
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:45,000
dealing with this over the past two

262
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:48,899
years and somebody discovered who did

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,170
apt1 there is the company discovered a

264
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:55,470
bit in one where it's a beginning of the

265
00:14:52,170 --> 00:15:00,269
time there's gonna move into a case

266
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:04,890
study practical film listen the lies a

267
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:07,380
practical case back to the year 2000 an

268
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,810
important government institution any

269
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:13,019
institution is a real case i have a

270
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,209
friend a friend of mine face stitch

271
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:21,089
number one this my friend is not being

272
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:24,180
paid those jobs made and down for the

273
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:28,320
government my friend deliver he's just

274
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:30,329
probably he full field and was committed

275
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,739
with the deadlines my friend

276
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:36,029
made a complaint through the natural

277
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:38,639
institutional procedure oh you'll ever

278
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:44,899
have to pay for my job is so much money

279
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:48,899
stitch be my friend and made in report

280
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:51,989
through scanning the recognition of the

281
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:55,470
target and analysis of the institutional

282
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:58,379
aim I'm going to off and mess

283
00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:06,329
around with them this ministry face to

284
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:11,029
do compromise exploit sure we have

285
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:11,029
compromised immune Street systems pays

286
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:20,089
300 pack them off let's go to the back

287
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:24,149
door into the system pays for it I'm

288
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:28,529
verification of privileges this is it

289
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:31,739
this is the way it is recognition of

290
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,720
accessible machines when I can get into

291
00:16:31,739 --> 00:16:36,209
I cannot find what I'm looking for and I

292
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:41,399
need lateral movement recognition of the

293
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:45,059
compromised system Oh another back door

294
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,129
just in case let's see what happens just

295
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:50,699
in case the back door does not work

296
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:53,610
properly localization of the back half

297
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:57,118
of this organization and the exchange

298
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,470
because corruption goes through email

299
00:16:57,119 --> 00:17:00,989
because of somebody people nobody's

300
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,199
going to riddle people thin and when you

301
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:05,610
send an email nobody's going to read it

302
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,539
just the opposite with talking about

303
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:15,168
cryptographic systems bad PSP is working

304
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:18,679
with the PCP was invented extraction of

305
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:21,959
interesting information from the system

306
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:26,899
reconstruction of the server redeem

307
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:32,130
threats with the back and black clothes

308
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:38,340
for the next day end of the mission my

309
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:40,620
friends did apt in the year 2000 it's

310
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,669
the same the same applies

311
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:47,610
the in the cars change the fact that ok

312
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:51,030
that the monitor is the robot the robot

313
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:54,270
on board changes the methodology in

314
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:59,120
vehicles like this we may not know how

315
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:02,510
to name it it was not categorized as apt

316
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:09,139
d but this dates back to stems from the

317
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:12,980
beginning of the times another it fam

318
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:16,679
this is awesome mic pres

319
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:20,220
resilience when I hear this term for the

320
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:22,830
very first time I freaked out resilience

321
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:26,550
means in such a way that they have

322
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,159
backup system when a gift packing guys

323
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:33,510
are destroying you create an infinite

324
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:37,740
loop of recovery in the back cap this is

325
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:40,530
resilience around these we can talk

326
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,410
about a validity of critical data and

327
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,450
applications business applications

328
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:48,420
stable stability of the recovery

329
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,210
recovery of IT structure and capacity of

330
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,059
recovery within a disaster if you are

331
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,670
backed off every day you cannot recover

332

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,559
backup copies otherwise they won't pay

340
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:20,370
attention to you if I tell you you are r

351
00:19:52,870 --> 00:20:01,270
these sophisticated Juarez is invading

352
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:04,930
the antiviruses my god oh the original

353
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,360
had poor crack Ted ticketmaster and

354
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:10,930
Victor i bought the original ones maybe

355
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:15,459
maybe may nguoi this one with the typos

356
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:20,320
and mrs. spells chapter chapter one

357
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:24,540
chapter one of output grab your first

358
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,490
Troy young undetectable by viruses

359
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:33,120
discreet the first ring that no viruses

360
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:38,020
can detective d stick back to 2000 for

361
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:42,370
you jump over antiviruses this is not a

362
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:48,370
new thing that is always the same all

363
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:50,559
the same so if we tend to give these new

364
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:54,250
labels and names because the business

365
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:57,460
must go on and on and on own this is all

366
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:59,740
about money on business there is I can

367
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:04,559
do this with the learning machine of

368
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:07,480
machine learning another example o

369
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:11,230
people fader hackers was invented

370
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:17,110
there's some guys who wrote this book

371
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:21,760
hackers year 2001 this guy for me is my

372
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:27,100
hero because one of them it's super

373
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:31,320
important he's super important let's see

374
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,320
if I can find it passwords

375
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,750
in berkeley in the genus berkeley

376
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,320
assistance instead of having a 10

377
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,450
characters they mix them at capital and

378
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,340
small letters in characters

379
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,560
heterogeneous characters and some

380
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,580
numbers this have been working for so

381
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:53,220
long in time that consider is saved

382
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:57,270
passwords I in but we are telling the

383
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:01,440
same staff in 2015 password is still

384
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:07,139
Antonio point comma 1 2 3 / same style

385
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:11,780
as they said in the year to 2000 there's

386
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:16,530
another boot dating back to the year

387
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:19,800
1991-92 in hardening policies and data

388
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:22,410
centers they tell the same story same

389
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:25,440
style but it's so cool for the human

390
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,960
means it means not to know something new

391
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,730
we are too repetitive we are repeatedly

392
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:34,730
we are repeating the same stuff over the

393
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:37,470
past 35 years oh no the artists real

394
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,580
safe and secure passwords so

395
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:44,280
technological solutions for these IT

396
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:47,970
issues there are so many solutions they

397
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:51,990
are not too bad manufactured technology

398
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:53,820
is technology period as vehicles nobody

399
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,820
trading in the Nasdaq some of the nard

400
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,909
 Babs only some of them the normal

401
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,340
things that technology exists in you can

402
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:05,450
do fabulous things if you get into lab

403
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:09,090
computer technologies exist period

404
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:11,400
secondly perhaps these rigs are not the

405
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,889
rig's that we have to face in confront

406
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,340
in the days in a grassroots movement but

407
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:20,940
we need to discover the corporate rigs

408
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,409
at a planet institution organization

409
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,420
we're going to enter the Citizens

410
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:27,150
Council thanks to the existence of these

411
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,660
rigs that we cannot vision as a no

412
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:33,660
decision we're gonna do this we're over

413
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,570
the next 15 years i'm going to spend

414
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,310
less time with you about within 15 years

415
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,429
in time we'll be doing the same style

416
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:43,049
The Rake's what are the rigs I said we

417
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,360
have to acknowledge ease

418
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:48,269
and we are having more and more

419
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,869
technologies trying to avoid ABT they

420
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:55,649
did to the year two thousand and two so

421
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:58,559

422
00:23:55,649 --> 00:24:03,799

00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:11,830
are specialize in creating snow where

661
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:15,359
smoke creators in at reds in props

662
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:21,098
behind there's nothing in iconic ins

663
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:23,290
conceived teachers at school my habit 20

664
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:26,200
year old the child who knows much more

665
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:28,359
under his teachers educational effort

666
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,160
has to be if we live in detail work

667
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:33,130
let's make investment on the digital

668
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,490
world which is education now school

669
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:38,380
network teachers pupils is not worth and

670
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:40,390
having a super technology college could

671
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:45,450
eat the teacher hasn't have my idea of

672
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:45,450
touching the power it does my answer

673
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:59,290
this is that's what see it that was it

674
00:37:51,160 --> 00:38:02,399
okay got it that guy the bag he's

675
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,400
written his hand

676
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:13,410
I have a question about the digital

677
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:17,609
natives I would like to tell a short

678
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:21,839
story I'm a networking technician my

679
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:26,578
company a girl i came in i had to do

680
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:29,869

681
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:33,240
was but she was putting in and back a

682
00:38:29,869 --> 00:38:37,800
USB they're putting in and out what is

683
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:40,200

lunch and do you think sir that did it

686
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,180
tell nate is maybe something been

687
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,759
invented by us to justify that they had

688
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,669
been born with technology but they don't

689
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,790
know how to manage it that's the point

690
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:02,760
native detail needed do not exist that's

691
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:05,460
the point least a lipid natives do not

692
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,880
exist if I were born with a tablet but I

693
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,700
wouldn't I I was some Superman at a time

694
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,220
I will now be able to manage the talents

695
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,680
my son the one who is in this and if you

696
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,569
with it tablet is going to be in pencil

697
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,040
with the talent they won the smart guy

698
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:22,680
with the tablet is going to be a smart

699
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,130
guy with the tablet but if we had to

700
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,808
keep things moving this way please don't

701
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:31,589
be too trespassing people otherwise we

702
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:33,799
have stopped working any more questions

703
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:33,799
please

704
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:46,390
no more questions st. Thomas of Aquino

705
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:49,240
niche Plato Aristotle it's very

706
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:52,900
important to read philosophers we are

707
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:55,720
losing this habit especially Nietzsche

708
00:39:52,900 --> 00:40:00,900
some Thomas of Aquino are taught to play

709
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:05,830
to the big philosophers of antiquity

710
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:10,570
Antonio my question refers to the mobile

711
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:13,090
hackers um smartphones how are they

712
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:15,790
connected to the computing through brute

713
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:19,030
tooth in what way your model phone can

714
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:22,420
be hacked through a computer through a

715
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:26,410
computer you know the attack it would be

716
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,390
usable through your intelligence about

717
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:32,770
the reception I would attack the object

718
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:34,480
the target that is the same if you try

719
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:38,230
to compromise your computer by

720
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,300
introducing and malicious software that

721
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,760
will be launched when you synchronize

722
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,040
with your iPhone in your backup copies

723
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,530
is more complete than visiting internet

724
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,230
from your vodafone websites and

725
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:52,360
compromising the mobile security is your

726
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,610
smartphone the possibility exists but

727
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:57,100
things are easier than with all how am I

728
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,320
going to collapse against a tower if I

729
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,380
can get into the house through the

730
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:05,410
kitchen the mole phones are real

731
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:10,090
computers that can suffer the best same

732
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:12,520
attacks as any kind of computer but they

733
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,960
target is easier to compromise through

734
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,970
their mobile phone through navigation

735
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,150
reception the reception's of mms

736
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:24,669
messages yes rather than the opposite

737
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:27,180
through a computer ready for you to run

738
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:30,190
into plug in your Android or iPhone

739
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:36,669
which are very different can get into

740
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:40,200
your computer another question for

741
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:43,480
example just tell this telephone career

742
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,589
very late Lane has been off friend for

743
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:50,819
free smartphones

744
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:54,239
it's very simple from a smartphone into

745
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:58,319
extract all the phone contacts in what

746
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,900
way what do you suggest I would what

747
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,670
would be your recommendation for people

748
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,640
having and smartphones and they don't

749
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:08,969
want to risk and compromise their

750
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:12,210
contacts information this is going for

751
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:14,390
many people I'm fed out of helping

752
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:17,009
people that they don't want to be helped

753
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,589
that's true many people don't care about

754
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:22,999
them did not like being helped we have

755
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:25,890
to invented this concept of privacy that

756
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:27,988
good professor can you reclaim when you

757
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:29,759
have the fight house and friends on

758
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:31,950
Facebook many people don't want privacy

759
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,640
or intimacy but you want purposing

760
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:39,269
intimacy in the sense is that there are

761
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:44,749
tools there are enough technology to

762
00:42:39,269 --> 00:42:46,558
safeguard in such ways safeway in

763
00:42:44,749 --> 00:42:48,328
information on your mother phones

764
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,239
containers privileges with

765
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:55,229
authentications before and against that

766
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:57,719
access with all these apps you can some

767
00:42:55,229 --> 00:42:59,249
extent the alternative markets because

768
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:03,029
official markets about being in a

769
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:05,399
committed to do this from Charlie milord

770
00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:08,369
and the cooler full of malicious app I

771
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,890
need an app to check out biography is

772
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:14,029
please don't ask me for my graph is

773
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:18,269

00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:06,750
deleting philosophy in the schools no

791
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:13,080

engineers on the critical

799
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:32,700
infrastructures week how can we improve

800
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:36,480
critical infrastructures yes I'm working

801
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:42,060
within I'm working as an engineer for a

experience with ritalin fracture

808
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:02,010
infrastructure when I'm getting through

809
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:04,440
these channels and tunnels I want to

810
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,270
lead these channels as soon as possible

811
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:13,310
many more things do not happen because

812
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:15,900
God does not want it we need to feel

813
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:18,570
discomfort actors with thinking

814
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:22,890
engineers not with civil

815
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:24,990
servants engineers promoted to level 29

816
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:27,660
are still turret who cannot understand

817
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:31,500
what you are telling him the most stupid

818
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:35,069
things is talk to a human planned and is

819
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:41,010
by the way there's the chief when the

820
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:43,320
big issues cam we have a steaming smoke

821
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:46,350
balls on the newspapers on the TV we're

822
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,940
going to invest on talent in here but

823
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:50,370
you are still doing the same thing you

824
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,130
are doing the same thing but the very

825
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:56,310
truth is my answer pretend

826
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:59,280
infrastructures our priority are not

827
00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:01,890
well protected and they need talent and

828
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,940
good engineers and engineers have taken

829
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:04,890
care of everything they hope you have

830
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,690
embedded everything and they have to be

831
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:12,118
the commanders of the protection

832
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:13,980
the critical infrastructures period yes

833
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:18,290
oh no shoot an arrow a pissy faucet and

834
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:25,920
I'm not an engineer myself I'm a map guy

835
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:30,210
any more questions please oh please let

836
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:34,560
me wrap up please please tell me hey I

837
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:37,740
want to ask you we are within this world

838
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:42,029
of hackers you are broadcasting this

839
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:45,540
program on the Discovery max Arden are

840
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:47,760
you not showing more parts of Wi-Fi ah

841
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:50,940
did some other embarrassed because you

842
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,660
you were prohibited from doing so or you

843
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:57,030
have are having afraid of bad use when

844
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,220
you are on TV when you are broadcasting

845
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,200
programs on TV you need to do you have

846
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:04,709
to transform it complicated this course

847
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,390
to the normal everyday people you need

848
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:08,750
to address our everyday people on the TV

849
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:12,839
we need to simplify contents on TV

850
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:15,240
that's the reason let's get that if

851
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:18,029
we're starting the googling enough to

852
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:22,560
see the chain of connections or database

853
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:24,630
and the user the viewers will stop

854
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:28,140
seeing this product so we need to come

855
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:30,329
they complicated stuff in a very simple

856
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:33,180
way we need to get things across the

857
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:38,099
beat to the people in a simple way the

858
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:41,160
one who knows the thins know that this

859
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:43,170
is replicated this way as I'm a double

860
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:46,098
check that this is replicable in

861
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:49,859
whatever environment by a know how

862
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:53,880
person but on TV you need to speak in

863
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:56,700
plain terms TD is not a textbook or a

864
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:01,020
professorship of engineering or mmm

865
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:04,680
static odd projective geometry this is

866
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:09,480
not to be any more questions let me go

867
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:12,089

around we're gonna let you go drown

869
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:15,770
