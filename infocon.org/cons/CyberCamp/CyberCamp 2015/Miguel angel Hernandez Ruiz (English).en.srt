1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,420
can you hear me it's a bit better okay

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,960
first what I would like to apologize for

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,679
the technical problems it's not their

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,289
fault it's my fault i had a mistake or a

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,170
problem with one of the ports here so

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,369
the idea that i have for today for this

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:27,769
speech is for you to leave the session

8
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:31,049
with a greater understanding thank you

9
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:35,579
learning to of how to think badly about

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,710
applications that's what i want i have

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,010
some tests prepared i brought them with

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,010
me to prolonged or to extend black

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:49,800
friday a little bit making the most or

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:53,519
exploiting faults in commercial websites

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,989
and I've brought an extra computer with

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,739
me to make sure we can do that so let's

17
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:02,218
hope we can have a look so if we don't

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,739
have for example if they don't have our

19
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,960
size it says our sizes ins available to

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,740
insist and ask for our size anyway and

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,880
then they'll the ones that'll have to

22
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,979
find it

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,939
and we need to show the fact that their

24
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:19,479
application could be improved so we're

25
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:23,288
going to talk about motivation if we can

26
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,908
get the cable I need because I think

27
00:01:23,289 --> 00:01:26,799
it's actually very interesting for you

28
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,840
to see that the organizers can bring me

29
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,130
the cable I need but the motivation then

30
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:38,170
we talking about here is all about these

31
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:40,720
everyday subjects for in a conference

32
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:47,459
where Steve Jobs presented one of his

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:51,459
eye products they they people got VIP

34
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:53,049
entries VIP entries for free and this

35
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:57,810
was because the application didn't

36
00:01:53,049 --> 00:02:01,420
behave correctly appropriately and

37
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:05,319
virtuemart extension for joomla this is

38
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:09,788
an example in which they managed to get

39
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:13,200
super user rights through execution of

40
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:16,529
her variable which was not validated

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:22,649
here this is one of my favorites Alex

42
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:25,260
holding managed to avoid the payment of

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,110
the ISC to how many of us he have the

44
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,170
certificate of you think so it's real we

45
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,000
is torture every time month of january

46
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,309
comes around and you say oh this year

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,200
how much is it going to be it's madness

48
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:43,019
hundred and twenty dollars i have a

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:45,630
match so in this case is c2 which is

50
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,930
what's requested by the cissp there was

51
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,870
an error and before the payment period

52
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,160
do you got validation and you managed to

53
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,980
get in without him to pay which is you

54
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,560
know which is great for us I've got more

55
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,988
examples here somebody in Illinois who

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,040
had their application for online

57
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:09,510
shopping somebody replaced the price

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:12,328
with a 0.1 and so they paid one cent for

59
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,048
all kinds of products these things

60
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:19,470
happen here we have another of my

61
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:24,150
favorites it's a bug in bugzilla so it's

62
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:30,480
like a kind of a repetitive bug and it

63
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:33,000
allowed you to achieve me or to kind of

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,850
leap over the validation of the email so

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,359
they got administration rights in the

66
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,850
application and here we're going to have

67
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:44,850
a couple of characters with us

68
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,650
accompanying us we are going to be

69
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,090
accompanied by a couple of people in

70
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,920
this presentation one of them is called

71
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:55,290
Paul on the left he's 27 years old he's

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,619
working you know he's been working for

73
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,829
five years already he works as an IT

74
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:05,310
engineer for a company which provides

75
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,630
shopping baskets solutions and this is

76
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,310
going to be really the essence of this

77
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,240
talk and what people can do with the

78
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,880
shopping basket and he's never really

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,610
paid attention to security issues and

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,019
his boss hasn't really either he wasn't

81
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,580
bothered about them although he was

82
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,370
aware that he wasn't really doing things

83
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,159
quite right here we've got Mike he's 22

84
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:30,240
he doesn't work he studies he's at

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,680
University and he kind of attacks the

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,270
applications that he finds on the web

87
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,750
because you know he enjoys doing that

88
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:40,049
and he's very aware of what it means if

89
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:44,660
your website is not really secure so the

90
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:47,490
story begins when Paul receives a

91
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,840
communication from his boss saying that

92
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,890
a customer has complained because

93
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,030
somebody is reporting web

94
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,130
vulnerabilities that have been detected

95
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:00,750
in our shopping basket you know do you

96
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:02,010
know anything about that Paul well well

97
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,560
he thinks well that's been there right

98
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,620
from the very first version 00 you know

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,820
he's never been concerned about it he

100
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,310
just wanted to make sure that the

101
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,750
application worked it was the much mum

102
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,900
too much hassle to think about whether

103
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,560
it was secure and obviously he something

104
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:23,489
would have got through to him and well

105
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,139
he had in mind what he would do in

106
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,599
you know in the event of having problems

107
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,599
and so it's pretty clear about what he

108
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:35,460
has to do and this is the application

109
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:42,380
that Paul has been using up till now we

110
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:47,580
can see the this car here from the

111
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:49,050
flintstones and now we decide he's going

112
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,789
to have lots of security is going to do

113
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,520
security he's going to go really

114
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:54,719
overboard he's gonna do everything use

115
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,380
everything even the stuff he doesn't

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,110
need is going to codify the entry you

117
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,639
know we're gonna eliminate non valid

118
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,620
characters we're going to codify the

119
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,229
exit everything we're going to cover

120
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,560
absolutely everything i can think of

121
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:12,990
West Tom it and of course shield measure

122
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,650
myself against everything here look at

123
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:20,909
the sessions and many other things and

124
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:23,219
I'll become this hotel from wrong stream

125
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:25,289
to the other and no one can get in here

126
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,789
it's impossible to override my

127
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:32,419
application bro were missing something

128
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:35,490
here and Mike is aware of this he knows

129
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:39,060
one given day

130
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:41,729
yeah well he hunks a 3am because he

131
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,740
can't sleep yeah you know these things

132
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:46,280
kind of happened you can't sleep when

133
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,720
you say okay we shall do tonight well I

134
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,880
look for some vulnerable machine she

135
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,889
going is there oh goodness i reported

136
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,210
this one month ago I see what happen

137
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:59,120
here and Paul enmity his application I

138
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:05,758
think if similar things got solved

139
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:08,460
because at least people listen to him if

140
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:14,580
I change a little number here and this

141
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:17,888
illegitimate to regret these might break

142
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,889
something will happen here

143
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,889
away

144
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,630
this will not render a pretty

145
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:31,030
but do you know you deserve some credit

146
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,280
when you get there and say well I found

147
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,890
a vulnerability after everything you've

148
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:44,140
done security-wise you're doing good

149
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:47,890
designers not not bad here I just got

150
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,169
something through new all the shelters

151
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,390
will after you shelter a total failure

152
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,760
shall fill with water we have abby's on

153
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:57,430
that is usually not explored which is

154
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,530
knowing how the application is

155
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,310
supporting the business processes and

156
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,440
going against this going against the

157
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,210
steadiest machines that are on the line

158
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:13,930
and this are the business logic attacks

159
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:17,590
and this is how Mike somehow managed to

160
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:24,520
own the pulse application so what are we

161
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:29,349
looking for in this room which color do

162
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:31,690
you think is the symbol our security

163
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,950
problems within an application regarding

164
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:40,210
business logic who goes with Bordeaux

165
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:47,230
green come on raise your hand ring over

166
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:49,800
there over here green yes it's green

167
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,800
actually

168
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,060
the application shouldn't have this

169
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,120
function but it is do it it is there and

170
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,609
we're going to veil of it for our own

171
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,620
profit so the business logic needs to be

172
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,410
tested and we're going to see a tool

173
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,900
there will hours to prove this I'm going

174
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,660
to look at a systematic methodology that

175
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,270
allows a suit at sighs my intention with

176
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,949
is beach or this presentation is to do

177
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:21,120
in half theoretical and half practical

178
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:24,090
so that right here you can see how

179
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,710
everything is that but I don't have

180
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,780
think I'll have the time to do

181
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:30,690
everything even though I will try to

182
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:34,260
explain how everything works and also

183
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:40,250
explain real cases are found that worked

184
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:40,250
really well so what is an abuse case

185
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:49,189
yes okay

186
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,100
let's see whether we now lacking can

187
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,900
look at practical aspects so regarding

188
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,820
the usage cases for those of us who

189
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:59,480
finished our degrees you've already seen

190
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:02,360
this we know how they work they are just

191
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,590
lists of establish an etek to make sure

192
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,200
that the application is functionally

193
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:09,020
okay and next we're going to have a

194
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:13,130
negative thorn burden I'm gonna have

195
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,390
someone evil there otherwise application

196
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,090
will go to production and so wrongly

197
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,560
evil out there we're trying to look at

198
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,080
the vulnerability it's not one but

199
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,520
100,000 evil people so we need to do

200
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,350
this before the applications go into

201
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:30,770
production so the abuse case it's just

202
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,800
an equivalent to the usage case he

203
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:37,430
doesn't even have a special symbols it

204
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,490
just artists a psych holder to that

205
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,260
negative thought there is no no no

206
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:48,590
symbols or a specific methodology that

207
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:51,620
are introduced this way is there anyone

208
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:55,430
here from the testing world not from

209
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:58,670
Ventus timber from testing so this is

210
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:01,670
basically a transcription of what should

211
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:04,969
happen within a cloud model with a

212
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,069
waterfall development regarding tests to

213
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,040
the business logic you need to look for

214
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:12,410
the key requirements we need to use the

215
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,660
usage cases available to assignment the

216
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,160
abuse cases whenever they exist if they

217
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,010
don't exist that can be created from

218
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,740
scratch we can do the workflows we can

219
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:25,069
look at how the brocation operates we

220
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,350
assess the vehicle data and we test here

221
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:30,120
because if this happens there might be a

222
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:33,160
mess in the company

223
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,510
I also need to detect to get a deep

224
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,219
understanding of the application to do

225
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,290
this we need to detect implementation

226
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,430
weaknesses and finally we need to put

227
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:50,260
them into practice all of these blunders

228
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:53,349
a lot of taking us to about so let's

229
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,050
look at a pulse of the catcher I'm gonna

230
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,540
stop here change the pc here and changes

231
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:04,529
at the end and check if everything works

232
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:07,449
so the application is a Bay version 001

233
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:08,830
this is from the vulnerable website

234
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,950
application haven't really touched

235
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:14,470
anything and you'll be useful to assess

236
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,480
this type of failures that might not be

237
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,339
included within the applications

238
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,040
development as such because he's

239
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:22,690
assigned us some sort of CTF where you

240
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,199
get different challenges and this one

241
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:27,970
wasn't there but I installed it and i

242
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,990
discovered that is it wasn't working

243
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,850
well you may disregard so as you may see

244
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:39,890
here the application

245
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:43,170
has basically a set of vitamins it is a

246
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:45,569
shopping basket application shopping

247
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:49,920
cart obligation with certain items with

248
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:51,450
a price and you keep piling them up you

249
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,520
just add them to your karting is just a

250
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,550
normal application source let's look at

251
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,170
what we can do to truck to test this

252
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:02,040
because we need to work harder night and

253
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:05,630
see what it does just having about a

254
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,670
contacting on an item search a part

255
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,200
where we have a shopping trolley and we

256
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:13,140
have a central core for business

257
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,270
processes which is logging and account

258
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,699
registration you access is left

259
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,350
detection you select an item you can

260
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,589
increase or decrease the number of items

261
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,850
you can add them to the cart you can

262
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,920
increase the decreasing number of items

263
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,990
and then you come update the card of the

264
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,589
basket the can't of the basket so he's

265
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:36,089
using normal application plug and within

266
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:41,040
this flow we have several critical

267
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:43,350
points where there are there may be an

268
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,899
increase of privileges and bonds with

269
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:50,250
content access where the class is

270
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:52,270
altered and this is a key parameter for

271
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:56,010
all these points

272
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,010
with Mike's thinking

273
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:05,390
thinking well I want to break this could

274
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,760
have access to private sections maybe

275
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:11,360
some of them are publish button i cannot

276
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,880
see them will happen see if i add a

277
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,890
negative number or wrong type in da

278
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,200
sections Lecter we're happy Singh I

279
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,660
Philly in the sessions are actor with a

280
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,210
number of more than 100,000 deeds could

281
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,829
I modify the price of items could I

282
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:28,190
modify the number of items without

283
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,260
altering the total price I need to add a

284
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,420
negative number of items it will be

285
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,819
possible to request non-existent items

286
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,010
with all items we published we're a

287
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,839
request a non-public one which would be

288
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:45,439
the maximum number of items to request

289
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:48,830
good a feeling filthy art yes you pay

290
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,260
for it great try and change the price

291
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,480
you enjoy update what happens if I do an

292
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,580
either update on an item that is not in

293
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,070
my cart there's something you can think

294
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,630
about in just two minutes you get there

295
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,540
and see it because you don't say okay

296
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:07,280
how can you break it but you need to

297
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:10,079
have a mindset set on breaking things

298
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,230
crying include a negative number of

299
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:18,170
items for an update this is equivalent

300
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:21,990
to that abuse case that's an abuse case

301
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:24,689
designed for this to ride around the

302
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,280
update for the number of items should we

303
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,780
select three items who will add them to

304
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:33,089
the car to would update the number of

305
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:36,120
items hanging this flow there is someone

306
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,220
who is a security tester who includes

307
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,890
these negative thinking includes a

308
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,360
negative number of items our house is

309
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,430
done because if it's limited by the

310
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,320
interface how do we do it by having

311
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:52,890
interception proxies which is bar suit

312
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:58,680
emboss we chose up so let's see whether

313
00:15:52,890 --> 00:16:00,449
we manage to show how how this works

314
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,370
keep your active is to get a better

315
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,340
trust level in the treatment of the

316
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:07,410
items on the server side we have certain

317
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,880
preconditions things need to be in the

318
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,610
wrong place and the categories if you

319
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,140
have the items we need to execute this

320
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,660
case we have saying holders such as the

321
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,040
user in the tester in the description

322
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,439
let's say it's a place that will need to

323
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,540
follow in practical terms we can think

324
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,420
of this anyhow we want anywhere we want

325
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,150
there's an axle with this and we shoot

326
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,770
up you should assess abuse cases that

327
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,400
should be available right after the

328
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:34,560
requirements stage because the

329
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,699
development department needs to be aware

330
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:42,030
but they don't have time in development

331
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:44,430
but I need to be aware of the most

332
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,870
critical parts of the application if I

333
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,089
tell development well these are your

334
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,910
critical points development will take

335
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,070
into account in mind all of this just

336
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,480
like if they give them a set of security

337
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:58,380
requirements are gonna say ok validate

338
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:02,940
all the data inputs we have on server

339
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:05,040
and the sources vs special captures and

340
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,780
reject the request you can have that and

341
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,040
they will take that into account from

342
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,510
the beginning otherwise they're mine are

343
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,510
now about it because in development

344
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,129
they're not especially its own security

345
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,520
given I don't know how to program this

346
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,520
kind of application

347
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:27,920
think you would have the first half

348
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:27,920
maybe we can try to put the cable

349
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,719
meanwhile I'll sum up the three demos

350
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,630
will do a first mo with an application

351
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,970
that I've got hearing a trump card is

352
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,970
application not supposed by Paul

353
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,960
my booking even leave it here as you

354
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:55,530
wish nothing might be easier I do

355
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,530
apologize

356
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:12,120
estaba Civetta men

357
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:13,860

or a este before way hey Aggie reston

359
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:19,100
enduro we connect this through vga

360
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,730
is that the hit

361
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,399
like you want to tell about Matt oh oh

362
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,860
I think it to get into if you got on

363
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,860
girls

364
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,959
I'll get it from tonight

365
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,959
oh yes I give Ric intimate with me

366
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,029
chief no no

367
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,489
this is working

368
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:09,340
okay might not be able to see it at the

369
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:13,750
end but we're going to show you a video

370
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:16,379
that I recorded and when we have

371
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,210
something we like in the back fire they

372
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,250
did all this we could ask for our size

373
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:27,460
and is not that because if I want it I

374
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:29,860
want it and on this heart we have

375
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,530
exactly the same thing we've seen in the

376
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,770
abuse case we don't have it here on a

377
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:38,980
video we have it locally and we assumed

378
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:41,020
he was enough of a guarantee the famous

379
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,730
is capture Amish ave deqing cuando vamos

380
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,440
a fair Emma here we capture the request

381
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,370
when we do an update we change the

382
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:51,130
number of items to a negative number so

383
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:53,820
what happens here the application gives

384
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:56,770
you money back because he calculates

385
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,720
there's a calculation with that number

386
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:04,179
you sent her and he gives you money back

387
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,900
and this seems funny but you may see my

388
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:12,570
yahwah's presentation which is online

389
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:15,190
you can see or about things zero cost

390
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:17,830
this is quite funny because I bought 20

391
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:21,010
counts there not recently I could still

392
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,809
do it and I was bringing my mum my demo

393
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,080
to keep buying a zero cost until

394
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:25,080
yesterday

395
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,969
yesterday I did the last test and I saw

396
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,480
that they had changed everything it's

397
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:37,730
wonderful

398
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:40,460
and I said okay so what now and I was

399
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:44,809
there until 5am and managed to

400
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,700
restructure the presentation in a check

401
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:49,220
that they were failures in the business

402
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:54,740
logic in other places that were quite

403
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:56,960
important well this has happened and how

404
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,020
I notify dancing it was a big commercial

405
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,480
but how did this happen all this happens

406
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,129
because very similarly you got there

407
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,540
with your shopping trolley to the latest

408
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:12,410
step to this step before the pavement

409
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,940
you get with that can't there you put

410
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,420
everything through a proxy recording all

411
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:20,350
the requests one by one he located on an

412
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,640
update request them with a forum account

413
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,428
and you did the update directly

414
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,050
nevertheless latest step of the last of

415
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,690
that being our lead the item to the

416
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:32,330
shopping cart with a number of items

417
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,660
that you have selected in the former

418
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:38,689
requests are zero cost because he didn't

419
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:41,929
have it he had an update operation or an

420
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:46,040
element didn't have there yes a business

421
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:51,020
it was not right and you could go to the

422
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:54,770
payment gateway with all your items you

423
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:58,730
could add whether you wanted socks or a

424
00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:01,270
gym t-shirt and you got everything at

425
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,270
zero cost

426
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:09,620
that failure was in a commercial product

427
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:14,149
later I saw the same product or more

428
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,520
webs in the last one is this one this

429
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,960
was hit this one here was on exactly to

430
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:23,389
check how the same engage by his work

431
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,440
and these are most quite funny because

432
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:30,980
we can modify our requests you get to

433
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,800
the last stage and when you have

434
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:37,220
everything in your cart you go to the

435
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,470
Gateway for payments with your cart

436
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:45,340
casting with all the requests that you

437
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:45,340
did on the line that would happen here

438
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:01,020
always seems he's not it's not working

439
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:05,250
eventually but well let's continue here

440
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:07,500
we get to the last stage and then you go

441
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,420
to payment gateway and here you may

442
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:14,310
change the description and the M here is

443
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:18,080
to do a two by one so that we change the

444
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:20,310
description we kept the same route order

445
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,159
identification and we say okay instead

446
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:24,450
of a bedside tables you don't have to so

447
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,670
you change the description no one

448
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:30,540
validates it they do collect the prize

449
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:33,360
oh you change the price and they

450
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,310
validate it if you change the

451
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,629
description they don't validate it while

452
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:43,919
you are at the payment gateway the re a

453
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:45,420
service that is saving the cart which is

454
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,150
like can always punish son where's my

455
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,730
card what the cart is there a shopping

456
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:54,840
basket is there but you don't do a

457
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:59,850
controller in bars foot to repeat

458
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,919
through quests and you get another code

459
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:04,379
and what may happen here two things

460
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,300
first of the request does a callback and

461
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,600
when they come back they validate

462
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:12,090
whether you did any of these dirty

463
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:14,010
little things otherwise you're there

464
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,840
with your two items but a young paid for

465
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,350
once you get two for one two for the

466
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,350
price of one

467
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:24,260
and this was example that I might not be

468
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:28,260
able to show you that i do how this one

469
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:31,820
I was like oh this is so bad I can't

470
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,820
believe everything is fairly well nearly

471
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:46,620
si si le bajo money how much handing

472
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:48,870
down low okay let's try it when I show

473
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,139
you the video and if you agree we'll do

474
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,209
this online because it's quite cool if

475
00:25:52,140 --> 00:26:01,410
you're in a hurry let me know but this

476
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:04,890
is really cool so when we get here we

477
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:08,450
are there a spoon for this website not

478
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:13,800
making anything up and you may say okay

479
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:16,110
there is a vest I like Black Friday

480
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,659
silver you know they're not many sizes

481
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:23,040
so here's like some mullah looking like

482
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:26,960
Justin Bieber he is a guy who can select

483
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,960
this it's not really my style

484
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:34,370
you know I'll get a green so it stopped

485
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:37,899
this here I think yes I did swap until

486
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:44,870
you change it yes I did change out I

487
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:47,720
like it better in green so here you have

488
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:53,290
lots of sciences you can't get why can I

489
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:58,670
not get these sizes why not who tells me

490
00:26:53,290 --> 00:27:02,840
which size I should get so you get here

491
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:08,360
and you select an exercise your electric

492
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:11,110
cart and not there we see an item why do

493
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,790
we do this because we have a suite

494
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:17,929
behind we have a proxy requesting all

495
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:19,490
the recording all the requests and its

496
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,560
really doing among in the middle

497
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:25,220
operation to see everything so this is

498
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,530
one sweet and we got two requests we

499
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,390
look at them and be saw I hate two

500
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,490
different sizes vary to cart because I

501
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:33,080
want to know how to have things on the

502
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,880
one hand and whoa i want an hour's

503
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:39,679
underlying how these application logic

504
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,570
works so i want to know what is the

505
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,940
difference of having one item or a

506
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:47,409
different for us so if i can an item

507
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:52,230
that is limited by interface allow it

508
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:52,230
and here we have a number which is 05

509
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,120
and if we go again to the interface will

510
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:05,379
see that this number corresponds to size

511
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:10,689
m now the size we want this is mine I'm

512
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:14,110
not gonna get any other ok this is the

513
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,520
aim and what happens here and careful

514
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,469
because this spring full website was

515
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,500

516

517
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,700

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,879
here you look for the field you modify

541
00:29:54,570 --> 00:30:01,260
it because this is a static hm HTML and

542

since I have it I can do anything I want

543
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:07,680
with it so you get to hear you look for

544
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:12,680
the field will look up a feel little by

545
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:16,610
little locate it and we're nearly there

546

anymore I don't know why and obviously

560
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:04,879
there's I would like to say this clever

561
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:08,350
here I'm not responsible for anything

562
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,350
that you do out of this presentation

563
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:18,140
this is last

564
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:21,800
demo all right let's see where we can do

565
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:24,020
another one online because it's a lot

566
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,980
more visual so you can see how

567
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:31,010
everything is done gradually let's just

568
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,920
try it and see whether we manage it show

569
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:37,270
it right once more

570
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,270
can we change you to hear

571
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:57,230
okay well thank you very much with away

572
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,860
let's try to approach with a cali

573
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:09,150
virtual machine anyone here there's no

574
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:13,949
cally well Carly is a line oxy solution

575
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:17,150
used to be evil and do evil things all

576
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:17,150
good things in my case

577
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:28,480
we can do it for the online shop for

578
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:31,940
means of payment let's do one of them

579
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,659
since on the video you saw the jacket

580
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:40,370
let's try to replicate it very quickly I

581
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:44,200
just take a little seat here think I'd

582
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,199
be more comfortable and make less errors

583
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:50,928
so here's our jacket yeah we have some

584
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,500
more here let's look at the sizes of

585
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:53,500
each of them

586
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,570
let's check whether some jackets are

587
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,980
missing some sizes this one doesn't have

588
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:06,730
XXL let's look at some lighter colors

589
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:09,250
let's go here I had look at one this

590
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,730
morning because I don't trust this

591
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,730
anymore

592
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,769
when I stage bad sweet Molly que hacer

594
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:37,029
program that is placed in the middle of

595
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:37,029
the browser

596
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,630
and to continue we got a mother era

597
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:51,080

na Shakara gay but to open this close

600
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,640
not

601
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,560
let's see if these works

602
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,668
so we have it here now

603
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,540
you just gotta live against me

604
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,569
so let's look at this here

605
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:57,740
and look at whether there is any problem

606
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:01,250
regarding the cookies

607
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:06,629
let's try to lead this

608
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:11,550
so cookies here yes maybe it's due to

609
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:13,410
this let me just check this whether it's

610
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,850
a connection problem well it's

611
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:20,450
impossible to get here because network

612
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:20,450
cable is not connected as simple as that

613
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,870
fire on with you salio el fil a for

614
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,430
Univision logic if you don't connect

615
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:37,390
network cable you can move not do the

616
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:37,390
demo cause I see almost

617
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,680
corinthian segundo cool pad

618
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,310
but how do spray

619
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:32,440
sighs y esto esta function so we're

620
00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:32,440
gonna see if this is working

621
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:48,070
but they're not with you on the run it

622
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:52,000
okay so we got it working now here we

623
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:54,880
have the proxy recording requests we

624
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,500
have a proxy we can intercept things and

625
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,450
you come here and well we've got all of

626
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:05,860
the requests that are being made from

627
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:10,919
the website and we've got what the

628
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:10,920
website we've done it in the background

629
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:24,770
we've got the men's section we only go

630
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:26,670
to the coats and here we have our

631
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:29,600
favorite model here we're going to

632
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:34,110
choose this one just by way of example

633
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:35,060
and good they don't have my size so

634
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,590
we're going to simplify the

635
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:41,700
demonstration we're going to choose the

636
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:43,440
one here which is extra small xs we've

637
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:47,939
selected it we add it to our shopping

638
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:51,420
bag and here we have it but I want the M

639
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:58,520
I want we saw before so we go we take

640
00:37:51,420 --> 00:38:00,900
the m we come here we can look where the

641
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:05,280
request is where it adds it to the

642
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:07,830
shopping bag or basket and here we have

643
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,040
the identifier since we have excess

644
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:13,799
there are two sizes between that and the

645
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,210
m size the medium size so we increase it

646
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,250
by two numbers which would be the

647
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,790
corresponding code we take this request

648
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,780
can we say

649
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:25,550
not we want a three which would

650
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:31,170
correspond to em we launched that

651
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:35,150
request it says okay that means it all

652
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,150
went fine we do a five

653
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:44,600
so let's see here we have it we've got

654
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:47,540
our two things in our shopping bag and

655
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,170
here we have it we have the M we go to

656
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,170
the bag

657
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,080
we have the proxy there we don't need to

658
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,098
telling works I put it there yes it's

659
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:03,529
mine

660
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:05,599
I mean come here and what we have is the

661
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:10,299
problem that we talked about earlier we

662
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,299
have this problem in the logic

663
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,790
it's not

664
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:19,390
while it's telling us that they don't

665
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:21,940
have that article and I just want to

666
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,859
order it anyway because I don't care so

667
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:26,559
this one I eliminated because it's not

668
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:28,200
my size what am I going to want an extra

669
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:34,479
small one for it's much too small for me

670
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:38,468
so from here we say we've got the

671
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:40,930
product that we want and now we want to

672
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:42,930
what we have to deactivate I'm sorry

673
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:47,828
wobbly it's deactivated we want to

674
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:51,999
activate it so we find it here we come

675
00:39:47,829 --> 00:39:53,710
down here and we can look for the this

676
00:39:51,999 --> 00:39:58,749
framework on that particular button

677
00:39:53,710 --> 00:40:02,069
little by little it it's okay let's see

678
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:07,149
this is one bits over here around here

679
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:11,469
here we have it down here we keep

680
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:14,049
looking for it I'm getting closer this

681
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:17,670
one this one this one down the bottom

682
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:21,200
here we have this one

683
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,200
the table just below it

684
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:31,350
this one and then this one here we have

685
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:36,090
the filled set fieldset sorry and we're

686
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:40,810
getting closer to that button here it is

687
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:44,480
here we are disabled

688
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:47,110
that's not what I want let's see if I

689
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,110
can get rid of that

690
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:54,180
there we go so we've got rid of it so

691
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:59,190
now we have our purchase operation you

692
00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:03,839
know it's activated and here we have a

693
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:07,320
shopping basket and I said I'd rather

694
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:12,360
buy like a guest I don't like including

695
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:18,690
information so here we are we have our

696
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:20,160
item and this is the address for them to

697
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:24,420
send it to us we can ask for it to be

698
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,920
wrapped as a present but here we have it

699
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,920
we have our item

700
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,890
hits in our website and they should send

701
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,890
it to us

702
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:42,259
so with this demo we've got this far and

703
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,270
now we're going to do the demo for the

704
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,860
means of payment because we're going to

705
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,660
do it quickly because I've registered

706
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:50,020
with my own information yesterday I did

707
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,020
that in advance

708
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:59,368
and here what we have is a bizarre

709
00:41:53,940 --> 00:42:03,450
website you know I like tea sets I like

710
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:04,470
them I like tea houses and everything

711
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,810
related that and I want to have one of

712
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:08,310
these tables that they have how long let

713
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,480
me see if i buy some table slightly

714
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:15,110
having the tea houses

715
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,360
I'm gonna buy one it looks great doesn't

716
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:19,010
it snow beautiful it's really cool the

717
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,560
way whizzes across the screen as well it

718
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:24,620
looks great so I've got my little table

719
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,540
in my shopping basket and what we want

720
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:32,799
to do here is a two-for-one we want to

721
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:32,800
prolong Black Friday you know we want to

722
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:41,870
get one for free so we go to the proxy

723
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:44,690
and we're going to look at this one down

724
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:47,420
here this is what adds things to the

725
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,760
shopping basket and one option is to use

726
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:52,070
this request to add things to the

727
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,160
shopping basket once we're in the very

728
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,900
last step in the process but we're going

729
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,190
to go beyond that even we're going to go

730
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:03,640
to the shopping trolley we're going to

731
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,640
confirm

732
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:11,940
here we are here we're going to record

733
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:13,589
two requests one witching cruces it by

734
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,329
one and one which you decreases it by

735
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:19,710
one so let's have a look we've got to

736
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:21,690
post requests they go straight this one

737
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,329
increases in this one decreases so here

738
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:26,430
we want the one that increases they want

739
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:32,460
two for the price of one not one for the

740
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:33,808
price of two so here we go we continue

741
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:39,930
with the shopping process with one

742
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:42,660
that's the idea and we say yes I come

743
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:46,859
from Santiago de Compostela I'm called

744
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:49,558
mr. fake fake from nowhere street and I

745
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:51,569
go on to this follow step here this is a

746
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:56,150
commercial product I doubt that the

747
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:56,150
fault will be specific here

748
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:07,040
we carry on me carry on we can talk

749
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:09,050
about the invoicing method etc we come

750
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,540
to the last step which is delivery

751
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:13,760
conditions for delivery another thing we

752
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:18,590
could do for example the policies are

753
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:21,260
very important could anybody try you

754
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:24,640
know skipping the policies if you manage

755
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:27,260
to get a user without signing the policy

756
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,810
and you know I mean how do you get rid

757
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:31,790
of them if they manage to enter the

758
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,779
system without signing your policy I

759
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,460
mean obviously if they broke the law

760
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,810
would be a different matter but that's

761
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:38,600
another thing that people might try to

762
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:42,680
do too they might try to bypass anything

763
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:44,420
that seems important to the business so

764
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,810
the next thing we're doing going to do

765
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:50,300
here is to pay and as I said we're going

766
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:53,560
to pay with the registers safe

767
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:56,020
connection because we like security

768
00:44:53,560 --> 00:45:00,130
I went again we're going to come here

769
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:02,080
we're going to leave the proxy this is

770
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,410
good for you to get this first before

771
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:07,900
going anywhere else so we say this to

772
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:10,830
the proxy okay I know yes I know I done

773
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:15,010
this this is mine it's mine this proxy

774
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:17,130
so we confirm the exception and we send

775
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,130
it

776
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:26,180
and here

777
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:29,570
let's see whether it works here i have

778
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:32,330
the interception ok and here the

779
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:34,460
description the description where it

780
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:37,090
says at one table note i want two tables

781
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,090
two tables

782
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:45,879
okay so we click on forward let's see

783
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:48,569
we're going to switch the intercept off

784
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:52,779
let me get rid of that intercept and

785
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:55,960
here we're in the means of payment and

786
00:45:52,779 --> 00:45:58,329
then we need to know where my basket is

787
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,460
you know it's got to be somewhere I've

788
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:02,109
got associated with my payment

789
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,989
identification I've got to associate it

790
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:06,788
with my order what we're going to do is

791
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:12,269
take our request that we recorded

792
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:14,619
earlier we have it here this is the one

793
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:17,319
we're going to take it we're going to

794
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:19,480
repeat it in the background and we're

795
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:27,009
going to say add another one who says

796
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:31,989
yes I've got it here good well with this

797
00:46:27,009 --> 00:46:33,970
request that we've added we've got two

798
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,619
things on the one hand what we've got to

799
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,359
have the description which states two

800
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:40,210
tables and on the other hand the basket

801
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:43,640
has two we've got to see that the basket

802
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:46,540
has two and if not well

803
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,540
I'll show you

804
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:01,310
there they are 22 products so what we

805
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,620
have to see is whether it's going to

806
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:05,240
validate it what would we would expect

807
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:08,120
is that it would be validated I wouldn't

808
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:11,060
imagine that that be measures to to

809
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,520
think otherwise and if you do validate

810
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:15,770
that you get a two-for-one I found this

811
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,509
on occasions that it goes through a

812
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:19,509
payment gateway that they've created

813
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,600
they have a back end of quest and all

814
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:25,730
that kind of thing and then either you

815
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,819
can just jump over you know skip the

816
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:30,800
payment phase or add things to the

817
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:33,350
basket once you've got to the payment

818
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:39,760
the step these are important

819
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:42,350
considerable problems okay so this is

820
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,770
we've got so far with the demonstrations

821
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:48,940
and I don't if they can change me and on

822
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,940
the computer please thank you

823
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:11,520
bueno que cosa que se Messiah ok yogi

824
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,610
Kelly do anything that goes beyond what

825
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:18,540
I've done here is a crime so be careful

826
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:20,400
with that so let's move on to the

827
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:24,080
conclusions what's going on with all of

828
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,400
this is anybody test this in the

829
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,960
applications they develop do you test

830
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,950
this business logic over there one

831
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:34,200
person will have a coffee later I'll pay

832
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:37,410
for it i'll invite user coffee nobody

833
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,480
else well that's one person so hardly

834
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:46,350
any tests are done with this these are

835
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:48,030
really important fault sir you know so

836
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:50,850
the conclusion is that these light up a

837
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:54,900
dark area in security which is a source

838
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:56,220
of bugs it reinforces the application

839
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,860
security increases the trust of

840
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,870
customers in application security and

841
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:04,110
it's included in negative thinking in

842
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:07,920
the testing process so as we had

843
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:10,230
functions we can include more cases and

844
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,350
it will have a largely reusable

845
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:16,070
repository in the case of the abuse and

846
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:19,259
no security or perimeter perimeter

847
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:20,880
security device will protect you against

848
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,830
this kind of attacks you can prevent a

849
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,450
lot of things but not this so you have

850
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:28,080
to test this and guarantee that your

851
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:31,609
business logic is really well designed

852
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:34,350
and here we've got some event references

853
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:37,830
and any questions

854
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:40,710
now is the moment this is the good you

855
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:43,100
know this is the moment now I never any

856
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,100
questions

857
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:01,170
between between the two Bourbons up

858
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:03,480
there any times when one is better than

859
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:05,099
the other is it a price issue does it

860
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,080
just matter on personal preference it's

861
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:09,510
just a matter of personal preference

862
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:12,690
what I prefer back for several reasons

863
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:16,530
I've had problems in virtual

864
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:21,570
environments with zap and burp is more

865
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:25,230
agile zap is a bit heavier with the scam

866
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:29,460
the burp suites can I have better

867
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:31,650
results in general and it's a payment

868
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,150
application in produce very cheap I mean

869
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:37,170
this version is the free version that

870
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:40,910
we've seen and it's good for many things

871
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:44,010
you can do many things with it the

872
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:46,980
paying version i think it's 240 euros

873
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:49,590
240 sorry two hundred forty dollars and

874
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,240
you know you get your money back you're

875
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:53,040
the very next day it's really good it

876
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,750
works really well the functionality is

877
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:57,180
very similar between the two but there

878
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:59,849
are things that are better in zap for

879
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:01,319
example the interception of response

880
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:03,980
requests which is can be more selective

881
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:06,510
so there are things that I like better

882
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,369
but in general it works really well the

883
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:10,500
functionality is very good I prepare

884
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:12,800
prefer burp almost hundred percent of

885
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,800
the time

886
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:23,050
I think I casino so do the emotional

887
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:26,500
winners Dean I have two questions first

888
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:32,609
of all the version of prestashop that

889
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:35,590
the pay the the page used all of them no

890
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:37,600
well this is very recent this is just

891
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:39,460
from last week so I can imagine that the

892
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,890
version would have been the latest

893
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:44,490
version I'm not investigated I've not

894
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:49,660
done grabbing to see what there is there

895
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:52,450
and the second question is when it comes

896
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:56,109
to finding vulnerable when you find a

897
00:51:52,450 --> 00:52:00,310
vulnerability in business logic how do

898
00:51:56,109 --> 00:52:02,560
you react when it comes to informing the

899
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:04,470
company what followed you what process

900
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:09,850
sorry or what procedure do you follow

901
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:14,230
normally we look for a contact address

902
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:17,950
for that person and we have the payment

903
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:19,750
solution with shanna which well I don't

904
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:22,118
know if any of you some of you may have

905
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,710
got the response but I haven't received

906
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:25,180
a response but that you know they end up

907
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,430
solving it they know that it's there and

908
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:32,529
sometimes they might answer them

909
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:34,419
sometimes I might not and in this case

910
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:37,349
you look for a contact in the book

911
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:39,479
company and you can

912
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:41,640
can look through for that through the

913
00:52:39,479 --> 00:52:44,160
domain through the administration

914
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,339
normally there's an associated email or

915
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:51,930
you can open up an incident and in that

916
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:54,239
way the support services should give you

917
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,828
support another what they should and

918
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:59,999
they may not always do that but they

919
00:52:55,829 --> 00:53:04,410
should anything else anybody else no

920
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:06,569
well thank you very much we're just my

921
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:09,989
apologies to the organization that was

922
00:53:06,569 --> 00:53:11,579
my fault the problems that we had and

923
00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:14,369
I'm really grateful that they've managed

924
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:16,410
to give me the means to show you this

925
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:18,749
and do my presentation in the end and

926
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:20,249
again thank you to the organizers for

927
00:53:18,749 --> 00:53:24,439
inviting me here I hope to come back

928
00:53:20,249 --> 00:53:24,439
next year it's really cool thanks
