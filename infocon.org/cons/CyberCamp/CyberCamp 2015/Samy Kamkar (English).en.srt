1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,880
um hola my name is Sammy thanks so much

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:23,369
for having me up when I was 10 years old

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:26,460
my mom uh got me a computer she spent

4
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,810
every dime every penny she had to buy me

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,439
a computer so I had something to do

6
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,239
during the summer and we went to the

7
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,219
store she spent everything she had and

8
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,640
bought this computer and we went home

9
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,250
and I set it up and I asked hey mom can

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,399
I have the internet and she said okay

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,530
and she set up the internet for me and

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:49,980
immediately I found dozens and dozens of

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,590
websites about The X Files so I went on

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,629
all these websites and I started

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,629
downloading audio files of the x-files

16
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,280
and I started thinking there have to be

17
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,250
other people who want to chat with me

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,260
about The X Files so I went to and I

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,299
found a message board and I started

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,400
talking to people on this message board

21
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,799
about the x-files except after a post

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,990
you always have to hit refresh so I'm

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,490
waiting for hours and hours for someone

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,798
to talk back to me about The X Files I'm

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,960
like there has to be a faster way so

26
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,560
then I found something called IRC or

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,149
Internet Relay Chat and on IRC you can

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,330
go into a chat room and you can begin

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,670
chatting with people immediately so I

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,439
went into a chat room and the first

31
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,920
thing I asked was hey who wants to talk

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,970
about the x-files and someone said get

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,130
out I said what and they said you have

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,340
10 seconds to get out of this chat room

35
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,539
and I said okay person on the Internet I

36
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,100
don't really know what you're talking

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,960
about and 10 seconds later this happened

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:55,079
my computer that my mom has spent all of

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,320
her money on had crashed and I freaked

40
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,960
out I didn't know what to do so I pulled

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,329
the power from my computer I waited for

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,798
20 minutes to let all the bad stuff go

43
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:06,898
out of the computer I don't know how

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,349
they worked I still don't sometimes and

45
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,030
I turned it back on and after i turned

46
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,019
it back on thankfully everything still

47
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,060
worked

48
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,360
but as the adrenaline was pumping

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,280
through my veins and I just imagined the

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,400
power that this person had I thought

51
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,850
that was the coolest thing ever how do I

52
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,150
do that and that just brought me down a

53
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:33,690
rabbit hole of trying to understand what

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,310
people are doing and finally after a lot

55
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,440
of research I found that someone was

56
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,240
using something called win nuke and win

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,270
nuke you could take someone's IP address

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,130
and you could crash their computer and

59
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,480
once I learned this Microsoft came out

60
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,790
with a patch and they resolve this

61
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,190
problem and after some amount of time I

62
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,280
thought well if someone can make this

63
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,290
software can make this program couldn't

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,970
can't I make that program now that

65
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,980
Microsoft has patched this version of

66
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,930
window can't I make my own version that

67
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,890
works a different way and that's when I

68
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,910
started learning about reverse

69
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,670
engineering and exploiting software and

70
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:11,579
throughout the years I continued to play

71
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,959
a lot of games instead of a instead of

72
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,930
going to school I ended up playing

73
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,910
counter-strike a lot to the point that

74
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,280
in high school I was just sitting at

75
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,470
home ignoring classes and playing

76
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,700
counter-strike and I remember one day

77
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,740
that I was playing and I heard some

78
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,920
footsteps I heard footsteps coming to

79
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,690
come up behind me so I to speakers I had

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,339
a left speaker and a right speaker and

81
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,870
someone was coming from the right

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,910
speaker because I could I could hear

83
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,500
them on the right speaker but I didn't

84
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,780
see them in my radar so they must have

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,920
been an enemy and as they went from the

86
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,840
right speaker they went to the left

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,299
speaker and then they shot me and killed

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,120
me but I realized there's information

89
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,140
about where that person is there's when

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,580
you're playing on the internet with

91
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,708
someone else there's position about

92
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,630
there's information about the position

93
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,880
of that person from the right speaker to

94
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,130
the left speaker so i thought i must be

95
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,959
able to take that information i must be

96
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,459
able to sniff it from network packets

97
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,410
and then know where that person is

98
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,810
because if my computer knows to play

99
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,230
footsteps over here versus over here

100
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,880
then I should be able to show that so

101
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,289
that's when I began writing software and

102
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,298
I began to write software for

103
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,910
counter-strike specifically cheats and

104
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:23,880
those cheats let me see where people

105
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,010
were in the map or you know for more fun

106
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,930
i was able to just see through walls

107
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,349
um and kind of see everything that was

108
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,450
going on and this really got me into

109
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,820
reverse engineering where I could take a

110
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,229
system try to break it down try to

111
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,080
understand all the information available

112
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:43,590
and then exploit that in an interesting

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,780
way so throughout the years after that I

114
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,159
was able to get a job because of at this

115
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,200
point I was releasing open source

116
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,570
software I was releasing it for free

117
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,190
online anyone could download it and

118
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,690
finally someone asked hey do you want to

119
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,120
you want to work with our company I was

120
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,740
15 years old and I had learned that

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,790
writing software you can actually make

122
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,550
money and a few years later I learned

123
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,820
about another website and this website

124
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,650
is called myspace you may remember

125
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,870
myspace you used to have like really

126
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,780
interesting profiles like this one I

127
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,190
think this was my profile so if anyone

128
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,030
has had in my space you might be

129
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,170
familiar with this now on myspace there

130
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,700
were all sorts of things you could do

131
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,440
you could upload pictures you could have

132
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,920
comments leave comments on people's

133
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,440
walls and on one of the things that you

134
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,360
could do you could basically be in a

135
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,210
relationship and you can select a

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,670
relationship status so for example you

137
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,099
might be single in a relationship

138
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:43,260
married and in mine I had in a

139
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,670
relationship and I wanted to say

140
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,390
something else I actually wanted mine to

141
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:50,100
say in a hot relationship so I thought

142
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,380
okay how am I going to do this and

143
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,180
unfortunately it's just a drop-down you

144
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,850
can only choose from these available

145
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,590
options so I started looking through the

146
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,620
web through the website through myspace

147
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,909
and I discovered that there was a

148
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,800
vulnerability there was something that

149
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,250
would allow me to execute code within

150
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,840
the website now by executing that code I

151
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,120
could actually modify the contents of

152
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,700
the page in any way I could change any

153
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,680
text so i changed my text from in a

154
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,409
relationship to in a hot relationship

155
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,260
but as I was doing that I realized

156
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,120
because I can inject code because I can

157
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,920
inject this JavaScript code onto the

158
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,650
page I can actually make the users

159
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,960
browser do anything and from there I

160
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,820
realize I can do some other things I can

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,489
make someone for example add me as a

162
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,950
friend so if someone visits my profile

163
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,950
they'll add me as a friend without even

164
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,710
knowing it

165
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,840
it was around this time this was 2005

166
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,719
it's about ten years ago who remembers

167
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,979
mapquest did anyone use mapquest i'm not

168
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,060
sure if they had some mapquest okay

169
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:55,000
awesome and around this time something

170
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:58,630
else came out and it was google maps and

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,760
to me google maps changed the internet

172
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,650
it was the first time on the internet

173
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,230
that you could take something and you

174
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,390
can just drag and you could drag around

175
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,040
you know back on mapquest if you want to

176
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,659
zoom you'd have to press a button the

177
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,670
page would refresh and it would zoom if

178
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,440
you wanted to go east you'd have to

179
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,120
click the east button the page would

180
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,219
refresh and then it would load the new

181
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,140
thing but google maps with this amazing

182
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,330
interface where you could just zoom in

183
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,610
and zoom out and scroll around it was

184
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:28,180
beautiful and that was using something

185
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,160
called web 2.0 or Ajax I thought this

186
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:36,700
thing is really cool how can I use this

187
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:39,940
in the myspace stuff I'm doing so as I

188
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,469
did more research I found that not only

189
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,710
could I make someone add me as a friend

190
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:47,260
or change the text within my profile I

191
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,359
could add something to the person's

192
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,390
profile so when someone visits my

193
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,190
profile now I also made it add but most

194
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,919
of all sammy's my hero to their profile

195
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:59,110
and I thought this is kind of funny so

196
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,060
now when someone visits my profile

197
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,620
they'll add me as a friend and they'll

198
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,860
also add sammy's my hero to their

199
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,510
profile and I thought okay after some

200
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,160
time after good enough people visit my

201
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,490
profile I'll have a bunch of new friends

202
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,680
on MySpace unfortunately I didn't I

203
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:17,890
waited a few days and I had maybe one

204
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,170
new friend on myspace when I suspected a

205
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,330
couple more would happen so I thought

206
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,460
okay if I can make someone add me as a

207
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,909
friend and I can make someone add me as

208
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:30,400
a hero couldn't I take the code and add

209
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,740
it to their profile so if you visit my

210
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,260
profile you'll add me as a friend and

211
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,390
add me as a hero but the code will also

212
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,610
copy onto their profile so if someone

213
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,669
visits their profile they'll add me as a

214
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:45,130
friend and add me as a hero so if that

215
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,770
happens if let's say five people add me

216
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,600
then the next day if five people all go

217
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,180
to their profiles that should be 25 new

218
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,250
people so by the morning

219
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,020
I released this worm or virus and I

220
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,610
thought by tomorrow I should have like

221
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:03,490
six new friends um and after about the

222
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:06,220
next morning I woke up and I woke up to

223
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:08,380
200 new friends and I realized that this

224
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,839
virus had basically gone a lot faster

225
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,939
than I thought I had maybe 20 friends on

226
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,300
myspace in the next morning I had 200

227
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,160
and I thought wow eight hours with 200

228
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,229
new friends in eight in other eight

229
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,719
hours I must have another 200 except it

230
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,380
was doubling every hour so it was

231
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,750
exponential like a worm is so two hours

232
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,760
in I had maybe a thousand and then

233
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,550
another two thousand four thousand eight

234
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,649
thousand by around lunchtime I had

235
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,079
10,000 new people who have added me on

236
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:42,520
myspace and I thought well I can't

237
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,920
really stop this so I'm going to enjoy

238
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:49,270
whatever freedom i have go and get a

239
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:51,399
burrito have lunch and then hopefully

240
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,890
hopefully myspace doesn't come after me

241
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,750
at the same time my stays had recently

242
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:59,080
been purchased by Fox for five hundred

243
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:02,110
million dollars and I was hoping that

244
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:06,670
they wouldn't come after me um so at

245
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:11,170
this point I went to uh went to lunch

246
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:13,510
and I came home and I had over 900,000

247
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,500
people following me or nine hundred

248
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:19,569
thousand new friends on MySpace

249
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,570
essentially it was doubling at every

250
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,430
hour until around a million I was

251
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,870
refreshing to now just find out how many

252
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,779
people are actually being infected by

253
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:32,290
this virus and at a round a million

254
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:35,620
finally i refreshed and my profile had

255
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,329
been taken down so i went and i was

256
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,480
happy like finally have taken down my

257
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:43,540
profile I went to myspace com I went to

258
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,820
the main page and I realized odo the

259
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,920
whole website is down so the entire

260
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,270
website of myspace at the time the

261
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,069
number one web site on the internet was

262
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:55,600
actually down because of this virus and

263
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:57,370
I felt awful I live in Los Angeles so I

264
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,589
thought myspace is also in Los Angeles

265
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,860
maybe I should go and say hello and

266
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:06,370
apologize but I didn't really want to

267
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,410
cause any other trouble so

268
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,180
after I basically wrote a blog post and

269
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,130
I I wanted to show you know this whole

270
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,130
thing was non-malicious I was 19 years

271
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:18,590
old at the time and I described

272
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:20,150
essentially what i was doing how it

273
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,860
worked and also a technical explanation

274
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,439
of how it works so if people wanted to

275
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,540
learn how this virus worked they'd be

276
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,610
able to learn and soon enough people

277
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,469
were asking basically we're asking me

278
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,350
are you the Sami that created this worm

279
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,230
and started doing blog posts and trying

280
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,640
to break down the virus more and more

281
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,870
someone asked me that if I knew that

282
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,480
they were selling Sammy's my hero

283
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:45,380
t-shirts and like uh I didn't know that

284
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,750
but that's very cool and one day so a

285
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:52,160
month goes by and two months go by and

286
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:54,170
three months go by and nothing happens

287
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,839
myspace doesn't come after me the police

288
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,939
don't knock down my door and six months

289
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,310
go by and I think okay I got away

290
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,950
scot-free like I didn't intend to write

291
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:08,630
a virus or intend to write a worm

292
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:10,820
however I guess I did and at that point

293
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,580
I thought no one had to come after me

294
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,040
after six months so wasn't the clear

295
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:18,770
until one day I went down to my car and

296
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,500
I saw two people two guys standing next

297
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:23,800
to my car and I just got in a new car so

298
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,320
I thought oh no I'm getting carjacked

299
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,959
someone's going to try to steal my car

300
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,520
so I go up to the car and the two guys

301
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:36,380
say Sammy and like what like oh man

302
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,810
carjackers don't know your name these

303
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,240
guys know my name and as I walk up to

304
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:43,790
other guys come behind me they say Sammy

305
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,730
like yeah they say we have a search

306
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:51,740
warrant for your for your house and I

307
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:53,030
say oh no so I say I watched a lot of TV

308
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,010
and they always say show me the search

309
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,260
warrant so I said show me the search

310
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,150
warrant and finally they showed me the

311
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,110
search warrant and they talked to me for

312
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,970
about half an hour and finally I was

313
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,350
like guys if you want to do a search if

314
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,710
you want to do whatever you need let's

315
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:13,880
let's go ahead and do it so we finally

316
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:16,400
walk upstairs and there are about a

317
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,290
dozen agents in my house and I started

318
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,970
asking where they're from and ones the

319
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,810
United States Secret Service

320
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:26,300
another is the district attorney the

321
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,709
electronics Crimes Task Force and for

322
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,689
some reason the California Highway

323
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:34,699
Patrol probably because of my sweet car

324
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:36,980
so at this point finally something from

325
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:40,008
the movie hackers was real you actually

326
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,980
get rated with with people with guns for

327
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:46,339
hacking for computer hacking a social

328
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,709
network at this point they go through my

329
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:50,870
computer they go through my laptop they

330
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:55,638
take my laptop they take my cell phone

331
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:57,529
my xbox my DVDs my CDs my ipod anything

332
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:00,410
that has a computer chip or data on it

333
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,750
they then took they left me with a

334
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,969
search warrant which at no point did we

335
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,889
ever talk about my space I was hoping it

336
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,269
was my space and not something else so

337
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:10,430
finally I'm reading through the search

338
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:12,529
warrant and I read at some point it says

339
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:16,359
myspace and like okay good at least it's

340
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:19,550
about this and not something else and

341
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,379
finally they take my computer and a

342
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,839
dozen people at the same time I'm

343
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:24,980
reading through and and they're showing

344
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,899
all the places that they're allowed to

345
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,660
search and they're allowed to search my

346
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,610
home address my car my body and one

347
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,939
other address and I realized the other

348
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,290
address is my work so I asked you guys

349
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,360
are going to go to my office and they're

350
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,519
like we're already there so another

351
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:44,029
dozen agents broke into my office and

352
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:46,610
started taking all the computers at some

353
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:49,009
point the CEO begged with them to try to

354
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,470
just take my stuff so the company

355
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,180
wouldn't go under but once they took all

356
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,309
of this stuff I then went to court and

357
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,109
for six months I basically fought with

358
00:14:55,309 --> 00:15:02,180
the government fought with the Los

359
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:03,829
Angeles District Attorney and ultimately

360
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,439
they said that I was not allowed to

361
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:10,008
touch a computer for three years so no

362
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:11,599
computer used for three years some

363
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:14,449
amount of restitution that I would have

364
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,980
to pay the government probation which

365
00:15:14,449 --> 00:15:19,069
means every week I have to check in with

366
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,870
the probation officer and a lot of

367
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:24,860
community service where i got to pick up

368
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:28,130
trash and make a 720 hours which felt

369
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,079
like a lot more this was all because of

370
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,510
the Patriot Act and what was interesting

371
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,280
was myspace actually never came after me

372
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:38,650
myspace tried to hire me to help with

373
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,120
their security ultimately but it was the

374
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:43,540
US government that actually came after

375
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,990
me for this virus so after about three

376
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,849
years of perfect behavior I was able to

377
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,120
go to court and get the computer use

378
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,100
restriction removed so finally I could

379
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:58,290
get back on computers and I thought okay

380
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:01,450
this is amazing I better not screw it up

381
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:05,469
um so how do I use computers in a fun

382
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:07,930
way and all of this you know to me I was

383
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,730
never black cat I just always had I had

384
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,250
just a curiosity of how technology

385
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,800
worked and I think it's really cool that

386
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,890
we have so much available to us today we

387
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,380
have so much technology so much that we

388
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,569
can create from nothing from so little

389
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,210
it doesn't require a lot of resources it

390
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,160
doesn't require a lot of education and

391
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:29,820
it doesn't require a lot of money and I

392
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,980
think that's so so you know so cool and

393
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,330
to me hacking you know hacking in

394
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,760
reverse engineering is like a puzzle

395
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:38,800
when you're doing a puzzle when you take

396
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,319
let's say a puzzle in a paper or

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,990
crossword you're solving something that

398
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,700
someone intended for you to solve they

399
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,680
created something so that you could

400
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,590
actually resolve this and come to a

401
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,959
solution hacking is like such an

402
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,150
interesting puzzle to me because no one

403
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,070
intended for you to find that solution

404
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:00,370
no one intended for you to actually

405
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,140
solve that or to do something so it's so

406
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:06,099
much more applicable in real life and

407
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:07,900
it's so powerful so once I got back to

408
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,879
computers i thought okay how am I going

409
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,670
to do things that will be interesting

410
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,680
you know sort of solve my need for debt

411
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,530
curiosity and for that type of hacking

412
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,760
but also make some interesting changes

413
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:22,389
and also demonstrate some of the issues

414
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,359
that that were common today so a few

415
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,280
years ago amazon said they were going to

416
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,540
start doing things with drones that they

417
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,460
were going to start flying packages

418
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,760
around with drones and I think drones

419
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:36,190
are really cool technology however one

420
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,290
thing I'd like to prevent is let's say I

421
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,910
don't necessarily see drones flying down

422
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,250
my street I don't necessarily believe

423
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,920
that's a good thing so I started doing

424
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,730
some research and I found that the

425
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,799
parrot ar.drone at the time

426
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,020
the most ubiquitous consumer-based drone

427
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,820
could actually be hacked so I could

428
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,799
actually take full control of this drone

429
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,260
so I created something called Skyjack

430
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,740
and essentially skyjack is a drone

431
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,120
that's built to hack into other drones

432
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,370
so you can take a small computer a

433
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,750
raspberry pi computer load some open

434
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,780
source software that have built onto

435
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:11,030
that computer you attach it to your own

436
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,549
drone and you fly your drone around and

437
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,590
while your drone is flying around it's

438
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:17,629
detecting the wireless signal of any

439
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,668
other drone around and if it detects

440
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,549
that wireless signal it hacks into that

441
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:24,380
drone and then takes it over so if you

442
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:26,660
see a bunch of other drones you can fly

443
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,280
your drone around take over all of these

444
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,900
drones and they become your zombie

445
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,600
drones that you now have full control

446
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,400
over just like flying around wherever

447
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,080
and this is really just to demonstrate

448
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,210
you know as we're actually using these

449
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,790
things people can actually abuse this

450
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,280
technology which if we're actually

451
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,928
releasing things that are you know a

452
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,690
drone like this is only a few hundred

453
00:18:44,929 --> 00:18:48,799
dollars anyone can purchase one and some

454
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,380
of these things they're not they're not

455
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,740
toys right they can go very fast they go

456
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,600
very high they can carry payloads if we

457
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,040
have this type of security vulnerability

458
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,809
in a drone today what will happen

459
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,580
tomorrow when we're actually using them

460
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:03,830
in industries when we're actually using

461
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,309
them to deliver packages to every person

462
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,480
on a street and I think there's so many

463
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,809
other interesting areas of Technology

464
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,850
and security one of the cool things that

465
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:17,570
came out of MIT was something called

466
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:19,939
gaydar and basically Facebook gaydar

467
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,559
could go out to Facebook and detect

468
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,890
whether someone was gay or straight

469
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:26,870
based off information that they revealed

470
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,520
without actually telling you whether

471
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,280
their let's say gay or straight they

472
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,440
wouldn't tell if someone's a Facebook

473
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,870
doesn't even have their sexuality based

474
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,790
off other information we're actually

475
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,949
constantly leaking all sorts of

476
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,629
information about ourselves even if we

477
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,880
otherwise would want to hide that or

478
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:46,760
keep that secret or nets not necessarily

479
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,770
keep that open to everyone so it's just

480
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,679
like amazing things you can do with just

481
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,330
the information that's available one of

482
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,850
my favorite sites out there is please

483
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,399
Rob be calm this is a website that

484
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,469
scours the social networks so we'll go

485
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,350
on facebook it'll go on Twitter

486
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,000
14 square and let's say for me right now

487
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:07,340
I went on Twitter and i said i'll be in

488
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,520
madrid lucky to be at cyber camp

489
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:13,250
speaking and please rob me we'll say oh

490
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,789
by the way Samy Kamkar is in Spain right

491
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:18,710
now go rob him no one's at his house you

492
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:20,720
can now break into his house and you'll

493
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:24,409
be fine right this is the information

494
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,330
that we're constantly giving out mat

495
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:29,360
Honan is another really interesting case

496
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:32,480
he's an editor at Wired in one morning

497
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,110
he woke up to his entire digital life

498
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,429
being gone being hacked hackers were

499
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,168
able to get into his Amazon account

500
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:40,549
which is not a big deal because in

501
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:43,039
Amazon all you can do is maybe order

502
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:45,110
some books except they saw in the

503
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,658
billing section the last four digits of

504
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:50,270
his credit card number they then called

505
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:52,640
Apple and they said oh no I lost my

506
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:55,700
iCloud password how can I get back into

507
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,289
my account and what did I cloud what did

508
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,059
Apple ask him they asked him for the

509
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:01,580
last four digits of his credit card

510
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:04,010
number so he gave up those four digits

511
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,110
gave him to Apple Apple led him into his

512
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,480
iCloud let these hackers into his iCloud

513
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:10,939
the hackers quickly got into his iCloud

514
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,850
got into his macbook got into his iPad

515
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,190
got into his iPhone went into his email

516
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:18,980
changed all of his passwords broke into

517
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,500
his Twitter into his facebook deleted

518
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,600
everything off his macbook iPad iPhone

519
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,190
he was left with nothing and they

520
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,740
started sending tweets as him like

521
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,020
literally his entire digital life taken

522
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,450
over overnight because of this because

523
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,010
four digits a credit card the four

524
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,320
digits at the end of a credit card

525
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:40,400
number information that is on every

526
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,850
receipt that we have another one is

527
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,429
mcafee up John McAfee from mcafee

528
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:47,990
antivirus you know at some point a few

529
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:50,419
years ago he was on the lam he was on

530
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:53,539
the run for suspicion of killing his

531
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:56,210
neighbor and a vice writer actually went

532
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:57,740
with him and they started going who

533
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,630
knows where because they wouldn't say

534
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,909
where they were going but John McAfee

535
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,860
was trying to escape and as they were

536
00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:05,690
leaving they were sort of device writer

537
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,668
was documenting this entire process of

538
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,010
them leaving the country and going other

539
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:12,950
places and they also released this image

540
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,300
but they forgot to remove the GPS

541
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,190
information from the camera

542
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,230
whenever you take a picture with your

543
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,910
phone with your android device with many

544
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,250
of these cameras they have GPS built in

545
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,770
so that information is in the image and

546
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,530
they totally forgot they release this

547
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:33,950
image with the GPS information two days

548
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:35,960
later he was caught excuse me so I've

549
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,940
built similar apps just to demonstrate

550
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,700
this that follow my friends on Twitter

551
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,020
so you can pull up your name on this app

552
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,390
and it will show you everywhere you've

553
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,580
been and just a map as well as all the

554
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,470
images and in the order so you can just

555
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:52,070
scroll across time and see where people

556
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:54,050
have been so much other information is

557
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,120
collected what are the really cool

558
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:59,659
things that I found a few years ago was

559
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,179
html5 geolocation came out and basically

560
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,940
this is a feature within browsers where

561
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,190
you can write JavaScript code and you

562
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,500
can actually see where someone is so

563
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,120
you'll go to a website and all say would

564
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,070
you like to allow this place to know

565
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,780
your location now normally if you say

566
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,149
deny they won't be able to get that

567
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,129
information but I went and ice clicked

568
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,380
allowed in this website knew exactly

569
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:24,020
where I was in your the physical address

570
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,730
of where I was at that point I thought

571
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,250
how does it know how does know so

572
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:30,440
accurately where I am and that's because

573
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,270
of street view cars basically street

574
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,520
view cars are driving around everywhere

575
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:36,770
and not only are taking pictures for

576
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,810
street view but they're also collecting

577
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,510
Wi-Fi information Wi-Fi signal

578
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,340
information so every Wi-Fi router every

579
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,050
router out there has a unique MAC

580
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,330
address something unique to it and

581
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,190
nothing else and as its collecting this

582
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,439
information it's also collecting GPS

583
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:55,340
coordinates so if there's a Wi-Fi router

584
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,020
here called cyber camp and a google

585
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,550
street view car starts driving down the

586
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,530
road it'll start detecting that Wi-Fi

587
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,570
signal and it will also start detecting

588
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:04,490
the signal strength of that Wi-Fi router

589
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,590
so not only doesn't know that there's a

590
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:08,720
Wi-Fi router around but as it's driving

591
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,550
down and it detects a stronger and

592
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,620
stronger signal it knows i'm getting

593
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,629
closer and closer and closer and as it

594
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,189
drives away it knows it's getting weaker

595
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,380
and weaker and weaker and knows that

596
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,660
it's here because of that now it knows

597
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,580
it's somewhere around here and as it

598
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,980
turns and detects that same information

599
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,720
now it knows exactly where it is because

600
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,600
now can triangulate that information and

601
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,059
this

602
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,719
crazy I mean it allowed such accurate

603
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:35,879
coordinates and I was in Slovakia I was

604
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,830
talking about how Google was able to do

605
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,690
this and because of this you could

606
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,789
actually find where anyone was at any

607
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,410
point because you could just send

608
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:46,230
someone's MAC address and get an

609
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:48,450
up-to-date information about their exact

610
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,860
coordinate the exact physical location

611
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,900
that that person was whether they're on

612
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,649
a laptop a desktop or a phone it didn't

613
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,390
matter and in Slovakia they they told me

614
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,100
that is actually illegal to have google

615
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,419
street view cars so that Street View

616
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,918
shouldn't so that this should not be a

617
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,830
problem there should not be any way to

618
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,870
locate where someone physically is so we

619
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,059
did the test and we actually found that

620
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,729
google street view or dock street view

621
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:13,980
but this did work so if someone visited

622
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,850
my malicious page i knew their physical

623
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:20,280
address just by browsing to a website so

624
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,840
i thought how would google do this they

625
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,370
clearly they're probably not having

626
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,639
these illegal street view cars come

627
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,840
because someone would notice those cars

628
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,460
what else does Google have thats

629
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,649
everywhere that's Android so what if

630
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:38,190
Android was doing this and after going

631
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:39,809
through Android source and I found

632
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,299
nothing in Android was actually doing

633
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:44,580
this and then I discovered that Android

634
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:46,139
itself while it's open source does have

635
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,230
some components that are closed source

636
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,030
and this component that was installed on

637
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,460
every Android phone out there that's

638
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:56,399
closed source is actually taking your

639
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:58,140
GPS coordinates taking all of the unique

640
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,760
identifiable information about the

641
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,870
routers around and saying and sending it

642
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,090
to Google and I thought this is crazy

643
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,100
that means basically all of our androids

644
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,899
are just wardriving and then i looked at

645
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,149
iphone and iphone was doing the same

646
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,190
thing and then microsoft microsoft

647
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,590
windows phones are doing the same exact

648
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,169
thing and what's crazy is if you turn

649
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,480
off gps on a Microsoft phone or future

650
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,820
off location services on an iPhone they

651
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,860
continue to collect this information

652
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,689
they continue to collect where you are

653
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,120
they collect all the information about

654
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,860
every router around you so if you don't

655
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,260
even have a smartphone if you're on a

656
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,809
flip phone or a blackberry for some

657
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,850
reason and someone drives by you with an

658
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:41,309
iPhone your router is now in the

659
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:44,129
database because your router has why

660
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:46,019
well that's all it takes and it will go

661
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:50,029
into that database along with your GPS

662
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,029
coordinates and I thought this was crazy

663
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:53,549
basically all of our devices are just

664
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,350
like war driving machines they're

665
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:56,668
constantly constantly sniffing for all

666
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:59,090
this information and uploading in

667
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:00,809
databases that are accessible by anyone

668
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,090
so I thought it'd be cool to do a

669
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:05,730
demonstration so one of the actual cool

670
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,320
features of google is that while they're

671
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,789
collecting all this information they're

672
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,490
also collecting how fast you're moving

673
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:14,549
so if you're driving down a road at 20

674
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:17,279
km/h they know that you're driving at 20

675
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:19,860
km/h on this road and they use that

676
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,809
information for for google maps traffic

677
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,340
so when you're actually looking at

678
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:25,379
traffic patterns that's based off

679
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,090
people's Android about Android devices I

680
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:29,369
thought okay if they're collecting all

681
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,649
this information can I control that

682
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:34,619
information and I found that I can

683
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:37,110
actually control Google's traffic so I

684
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,309
developed a proof-of-concept app and i

685
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,879
would put in a source and destination

686
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:44,490
like if i want to go from you know this

687
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:45,689
location down to somewhere in downtown i

688
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,480
would put in the source and destination

689
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,399
it would tell me the directions but it

690
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,470
would ultimately send thousands of

691
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,899
requests to google telling everyone is

692
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,929
going 0 miles per hour along this route

693
00:27:54,899 --> 00:27:59,998
and then everyone else who would see my

694
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:01,259
route would just see traffic on my route

695
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:03,539
and they would get diverted to other

696
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:06,539
roads and i would just have a best

697
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:08,129
basically empty road so just like so

698
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:11,940
much information that we're constantly

699
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:13,649
giving out and I think there's there's

700
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,059
so much more that we can find it's so

701
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:16,918
much more that needs to be researched I

702
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,749
mean what are our routers telling what

703
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:20,759
what are our browsers what are all the

704
00:28:18,749 --> 00:28:24,600
plugins that we use all of the software

705
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:27,809
what are they giving out this is a cool

706
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:30,059
quote from Adam Laurie he's a well-known

707
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:31,619
hacker in my experience once dated

708
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,330
becomes invisible something magical

709
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:35,490
happens they forget about security I

710
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:39,449
think this is really this is really

711
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,309
powerful one of the cool there's so many

712
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,110
attacks that we just don't know about or

713
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:46,049
don't think about and that's capable

714
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:48,350
with low-cost hardware um this is a

715
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:52,889
tempest attack I mean the tempest attack

716
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:54,178
was published privately by the NSA in

717
00:28:52,889 --> 00:28:56,189
the 1970s

718
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:59,369
and that was when they were basically

719
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,950
able to view electromagnetic radiation

720
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:03,809
from a monitor from a CRT screen from a

721
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,629
different room they could be in another

722
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:09,450
room and see what's on your monitor just

723
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:12,389
from radiation absolutely incredible and

724
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,460
today we have so many low-cost attacks

725
00:29:12,389 --> 00:29:16,498
that are available to do such crazy

726
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,379
things things that you'd see in spy

727
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:21,330
movies or you know really bad hacker

728
00:29:19,379 --> 00:29:23,998
movies that couldn't be real but are

729
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:25,710
absolutely real some guys at inverse

730
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:27,360
path were able to do a really cool

731
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,840
attack where they would take a simple

732
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,789
laser a two dollar red laser and bounce

733
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,820
it off of a laptop or bounce it off of

734
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:37,590
something that vibrated and that that

735
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,019
vibration they would then they take the

736
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,459
reflection of the laser and have it hit

737
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:44,580
a photosensor something that could pick

738
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,980
it up is the picture of them and based

739
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,830
off the vibration from the actual

740
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,809
monitor from key from typing keys on the

741
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:54,899
keyboard they could take that vibration

742
00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:56,700
and turn it back into keystrokes they

743
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,498
would know what you're typing just by

744
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,990
knowing the language you're typing the

745
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:03,299
unique vibrations of all the keys Plus

746
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,799
frequency analysis let our frequency

747
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,720
analysis they would know what you're

748
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,200
typing on a keyboard just from that

749
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,629
image there's a new camera out called

750
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,419
the Fleer it's an infrared camera this

751
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:17,939
was one of the coolest simple attacks

752
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:20,789
I've ever seen they put a little camera

753
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,279
on their iPhone they go up to a store or

754
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:25,619
an ATM they take a picture right after

755
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,710
someone used it and you can see the heat

756
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:30,959
signature from the buttons that were

757
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:33,299
pressed and you now extracted their ATM

758
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,460
PIN from a two-hundred-dollar camera

759
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:38,908
that you can buy today and put on your

760
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,950
phone it's hardly noticeable some

761
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:44,159
incredible attacks with seems like basic

762
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:46,499
technology there's a research group that

763
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,899
was able to show that was actually able

764
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:51,210
to track keyboard key strokes so similar

765
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:53,639
to the attack using the laser pointer

766
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:57,059
they were able to take a standard mobile

767
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:59,729
phone put it in a room and here's

768
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:02,070
someone typing somewhere else and the

769
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,230
unique vibration the unique sound and

770
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,850
characteristics of every key on the

771
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,800
keyboard because they eat are in a

772
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,469
unique location on that keyboard

773
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,270
produce a unique sound and using

774
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,740
software they're able to extract every

775
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,570
single keystroke that that person was

776
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,430
typing in the room even though they had

777
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,639
no visibility of the screen or the

778
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:22,830
keyboard absolutely incredible and what

779
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,900
what amazes me is that this is something

780
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,210
that we all have access to every single

781
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,430
one of us has one of these devices right

782
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,590
they're inexpensive at least reasonably

783
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,060
I mean I guess we never thought we'd buy

784
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,310
six hundred dollars cell phones a few

785
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:38,129
years ago but now we have to have them

786
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:40,530
but we all have it we all have access to

787
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:44,400
this kind of technology and so much we

788
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:46,440
can create another another awesome proof

789
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,540
of concept was someone who is able to

790
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,600
extract passwords and keystrokes and

791
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,610
emails if you ran their software so if

792
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,250
you ran their program on your let's say

793
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,870
iPhone or Android and you went into

794
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:01,350
gmail and you started typing an email

795
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:03,780
based off how your phone would move

796
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,189
based off the accelerometer data they

797
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,230
were able to say oh well if you're going

798
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,570
to type in a you're more likely to tilt

799
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:12,270
it this much mersin s where you're going

800
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,770
to type tilt it slightly less or q

801
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,139
you're going to tilt it this way and

802
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,670
they could based off how you're tilting

803
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,070
your phone they would extract your PIN

804
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:22,170
your passwords all everything you're

805
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:28,260
typing in the emails I mean absolutely

806
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:30,690
incredible how a group in from Tel Aviv

807
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:32,520
University I actually did this research

808
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,110
and where they could do acoustical

809
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,660
intelligence they could actually use

810
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:39,419
again a mobile phone a standard mobile

811
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:42,210
phone the microphone in our phones are

812
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,740
capable of listening to audio outside of

813
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,940
the human hearing range they're actually

814
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,660
able to listen all the way up to

815
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,880
ultrasound to some levels of ultrasound

816
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:53,340
all of our computers the capacitors and

817
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,470
resistors around the CPU they make noise

818
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,629
we don't hear it because it's an

819
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:00,360
ultrasound but when you're let's say

820
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:02,460
encrypting an email with PGP or gpg

821
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:04,199
those encryption routines are running

822
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,290
operations on your processor on your

823
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,200
microcontroller all of that is loading

824
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:13,440
power into those capacitors around the

825
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,260
processor that power is producing

826
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,180
ultrasound based off that ultrasound if

827
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,800
you can listen to it which you can with

828
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,840
a mobile device

829
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,060
you can then know what instructions and

830
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,760
operations that computer is running and

831
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,500
from meters away from meters away from

832
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:31,740
the computer you can set your mobile

833
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,050
device to listen to those capacitors and

834
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,090
it will start to detect not only the

835
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:38,970
operations that are running but if it

836
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,620
detects g PG or PG p encryption let's

837
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:44,250
say you're encrypting your email it can

838
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,929
extract the entire key the entire pgp

839
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:49,080
key can be extracted from a standard

840
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:51,810
mobile device from meters away again

841
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,120
this is technology we have access to we

842
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:58,520
have we all have phones we all can run

843
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,520
this software it's absolutely crazy

844
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,640
circuits are another amazing thing we

845
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,500
have so many ground leagues whenever

846
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,240
you're typing on a keyboard your

847
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,070
keystrokes are going down a wire let's

848
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,839
say on a desktop computer if you are

849
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:16,080
typing on a keyboard your keystrokes our

850
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:19,020
share our shared on this line shared

851
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:20,819
with a ground line so information can

852
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,460
actually go from your serial line over

853
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,260
the ground into your computer if your

854
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,090
computer's plugged into the wall then

855
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,090
it's plugged into the ground of the wall

856
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:32,550
which is plugged into every other outlet

857
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,830
every other electrical outlet that has

858
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,200
ground on that circuit so if you go into

859
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:40,230
a room or an office you can plug a

860
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,449
device in and from the ground you can

861
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,820
listen to all the other leak leaky

862
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:47,279
computers and devices on any on any

863
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,360
other computer in that circuit that

864
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,130
means you could actually see the

865
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,110
keystrokes that people are typing is

866
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:54,570
they're using a wired keyboard on a

867
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:56,340
wired computer that's wired to the

868
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,950
electrical circuit you can see the

869
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,780
keystrokes they're typing right that's a

870
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,520
computer that could might not even be on

871
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,870
the internet it might not be on a

872
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,910
network it might be entirely separate

873
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:11,640
all right this is one of the most fun

874
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:13,399
attacks that I've ever seen if you ever

875
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,690
see a bag of chips be worried

876
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:20,280
researchers were able to basically take

877
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:22,080
a camera a DSLR camera and they took a

878
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,140
bag of potato chips and they put it in a

879
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,130
room a soundproof room with soundproof

880
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:30,990
glass then they left the room entirely

881
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,970
soundproof they put someone else in the

882
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,009
room

883
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,598
and there are two people in the room who

884
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,300
are now talking and you can't hear what

885
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,640
they're saying all you can see are their

886
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,770
faces and this bag of chips sitting on

887
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,259
the table and they use a standard DSLR

888
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:47,630
camera there now looking through

889
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,300
soundproof glass at a bag of potato

890
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:53,030
chips in a soundproof room with a DSLR

891
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,190
camera they're taking that that video

892
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:57,200
and piping it to a computer and now

893
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,900
they're looking for changes in the bag

894
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,060
of potato chips sound is just vibration

895
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,440
of air right when we're talking all

896
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,970
we're doing is we're vibrating the air

897
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,300
and that's traveling it travels far

898
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:13,790
enough and strong enough that it can

899
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,920
minutely change the foil in a bag of

900
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:17,750
potato chips it will just like my newly

901
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,710
move the naked eye probably can't see it

902
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:23,960
a DSLR camera and a computer can they

903
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,520
then extracted the changes the very

904
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,970
small changes in the back of potato

905
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,340
chips and they're able to take that

906
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:34,220
convert that visual change back into a

907
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:37,400
frequency and audible frequency and play

908
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:39,980
sound from the soundproof room by

909
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,240
looking at a bag of chips I would never

910
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,240
look at a bag of chips the same

911
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:50,299
e-cigarettes and someone would purchase

912
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:52,460
an e-cigarette from ebay they got it

913
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:55,160
they put in their favorite juice in

914
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,930
there ejuice they smoked it they smoked

915
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,160
it so much they had to recharge it so

916
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:59,810
they plugged it into their computer and

917
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,390
it dropped malware onto their computer

918
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:04,250
took over their computer gave access to

919
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:07,310
someone else to just take over their

920
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:09,290
computer from an e-cigarette I mean our

921
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:12,440
phones all of our phones are running

922
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:14,599
operating systems that are so powerful I

923
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,990
was at a phone company for a while and I

924
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,420
developed a proof of concept basically

925
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:22,848
an exploit that would exploit common

926
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,070
voice over IP phones it would turn them

927
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:27,020
on it would turn the microphone on it

928
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,720
would send me everything but it wouldn't

929
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,099
notify the user that it was ever on so

930
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,049
it looked like you had a phone that was

931
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:35,780
just in your office just waiting for a

932
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,609
call but it was on a call and is on

933
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,820
speakerphone and I could hear everything

934
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:42,290
and this was exploitable I didn't have

935
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,330
to run now I don't have to install

936
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,960
anything on your phone all your phone

937
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,460
needed was an IP address

938
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,200
today all of our phones have IP

939
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:54,750
addresses all of our phones are

940
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:57,660
exploitable so many RFID and key fobs

941
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,550
and ways to get into buildings all of

942
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:03,000
these can be easily sniffed they can be

943
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,410
emulated you can emulate RFID so many

944
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,420
tools that you can just go up to

945
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,520
buildings that we think we have so much

946
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,380
security around us and time and time

947
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,660
again we're demonstrating how you can

948
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,609
break this how you can how when you're

949
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,950
walking around with the badge or a card

950
00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:19,200
if that's able that's able to actually

951
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,390
emanate a field an RF field with a

952
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,118
unique identifier that says you know you

953
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:26,430
are you or I am me and with that

954
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,740
information I can just come up and if I

955
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:31,319
have a device I can swipe I can swipe

956
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,109
your information I can take that and I

957
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,240
can pretend to be you our wireless

958
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:38,220
keyboards so many places are using

959
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,330
wireless keyboards that I mean let's

960
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,069
think about that for a moment we

961
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:43,259
actually have keyboards with keystrokes

962
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,640
all everything we're typing so many

963
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,560
things I tell you if I don't want people

964
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,190
to find out if you only knew what i was

965
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,410
typing so many keystrokes that are just

966
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,510
getting sent wirelessly here's a device

967
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:56,460
that can sniff every keystroke of every

968
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,589
microsoft wireless keyboard around it

969
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,300
just looks like a USB charger if you see

970
00:38:58,589 --> 00:39:01,799
this thing i don't it might it might be

971
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,330
charging USB input devices or it might

972
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,270
be sniffing keystrokes from all of these

973
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:09,390
wireless keyboards so much cool radio

974
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:12,180
frequencies stuff a device I love is

975
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:14,339
from Mattel it's called the IM me and

976
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:16,890
this is a spectrum analyzer that Michael

977
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:18,750
Osman wrote he was able to modify and

978
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:20,640
hack this device so that they could

979
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,890
actually read the entire sub gigahertz

980
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,910
spectrum that means it can pick up all

981
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:28,890
sorts of information it could basically

982
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:30,868
see how garage is open it could sniff

983
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:34,049
that it could replay that you can open

984
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:36,540
garages it can unlock cars and start

985
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,520
cars there's so much stuff that we can

986
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,500
do with just like simple devices from

987
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:45,270
these um from these massive

988
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:49,650
manufacturers and just another another

989
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:51,509
really cool area scars I think Charlie

990
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,720
Miller and Chris valasek showed you know

991
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,150
the first the first a mate like

992
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,730
incredible hack of an of an unaltered

993
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,150
vehicle this past summer they were able

994
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,420
to

995
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:06,089
through a series of exploits on a

996
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:09,539
current Jeep I believe at 2014 unaltered

997
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:12,140
Jeep they were able to traverse over the

998
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:15,779
internets through the sprint network

999
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,940
into the infotainment system through a

1000
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:20,940
couple sections through there into the

1001
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,740
radio onto the can bus onto two separate

1002
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,930
can buses and start just sending

1003
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:27,078
communication and start controlling the

1004
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:29,669
car they're able to change the radio

1005
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,650
control that control the windshield

1006
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,839
wipers and then just turn off the

1007
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,660
vehicle they turned off the engine with

1008
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,210
this poor guy Andy Greenberg driving in

1009
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:41,460
it live on on a freeway there's so much

1010
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,470
out there and so much information and I

1011
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,119
think one of the coolest things one of

1012
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:47,180
the most exciting things for me is that

1013
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,160
all this is available with low-cost

1014
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,348
hardware and software any of us can do

1015
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,940
it right anyone out there can do it it

1016
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:56,880
doesn't require a formal education

1017
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,890
there's so much information out there so

1018
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,779
much that we can learn how to secure and

1019
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:04,020
how to insecure right how to reverse

1020
00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:05,819
engineer how to break and i really hope

1021
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,400
i really hope more and more people get

1022
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:10,470
into this stuff either the hacking or

1023
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,130
the securing you know security is hard

1024
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:17,098
and obviously with all these attacks i

1025
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:19,109
don't want to leave you insecure so this

1026
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:21,660
is what i suggest if you ever need some

1027
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:24,869
additional security a pretty good

1028
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:28,140
demonstration from inverse path but it's

1029
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:31,170
it's up to us to basically to see

1030
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,118
whether you want to dig down and go into

1031
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,710
areas that people haven't looked at you

1032
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,720
know what I'm hoping for is that people

1033
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:38,849
will start to research more and start to

1034
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,348
find more ways of securing find more

1035
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:42,119
methods of and techniques of

1036
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:43,920
exploitation because there are also

1037
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,049
plenty of bad guys doing the same thing

1038
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,470
plenty of bad guys who are getting

1039
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:52,440
funded by corporations governments

1040
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:54,868
criminals mafia were all funding all

1041
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,240
sorts of hacking in reverse engineering

1042
00:41:54,869 --> 00:42:00,359
so it's up to us to also find those same

1043
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,328
techniques and I hope some of you will

1044
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:06,170
join me in that so thank you so much and

1045
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:06,170
thank you for having me

1046
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:23,210
also if there are any questions I'm not

1047
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:29,328
sure if there's a microphone there any

1048
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:32,779
microphone awesome hola cuando when

1049
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:36,470
would you find some flaw in the software

1050
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:38,930
and it can be exploited um you approach

1051
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:41,269
the company what what is the response

1052
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:44,089
from them do are they happy about it do

1053
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:45,740
they answer to use you know that's

1054
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:48,230
interesting we didn't know that about

1055
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:52,868
our software they push your way saying

1056
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:55,880
that's bad you're getting a bad boy yeah

1057
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:58,309
uh that's a good question that's a good

1058
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,960
question it depends on the company more

1059
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,789
and more we have companies who are now

1060
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,250
actually have bounty programs right they

1061
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:06,529
actually embrace hacker the hackers and

1062
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,569
hacker community to come and provide

1063
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:10,640
those and they even pay you right you

1064
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:12,079
don't even have to sign a contract or

1065
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,690
anything as long as you don't steal

1066
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,160
customer data or disrupt service you

1067
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,450
know companies like Facebook will give

1068
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,730
you money will give you about bug

1069
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:22,399
bounties in Google and then there's some

1070
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:25,130
companies who will say bad boy right

1071
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,869
they'll they might you know some

1072
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,660
companies will try to have you arrested

1073
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:31,519
if they can so it really depends on the

1074
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,319
company when I started communicating

1075
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:35,359
with some of the vehicle the larger

1076
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:37,069
vehicle manufacturers none of them were

1077
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,470
prepared they're just not prepared for

1078
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:41,089
this type of communication actually

1079
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,740
they're starting to so they had cyber

1080
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:44,960
security officers that they've hired in

1081
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:46,069
the last year so they're a little open

1082
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,960
to it but there's no way to really

1083
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:49,788
contact them it it really took takes

1084
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,930
like actually trying to get in touch

1085
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:53,089
with the right people and some of these

1086
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,038
companies is very difficult so I'd say

1087
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:57,558
more and more people are now embracing

1088
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,450
the fact that this is like a necessary

1089
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,509
thing and if you don't listen if you

1090
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:04,490
ignore this you're you're going to

1091
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:07,279
experience every company gets hacked

1092
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:08,839
every single company gets hacked I've

1093
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:11,079
worked in enough companies that have had

1094
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:14,839
enough hacks some private some public

1095
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:17,119
and if you can embrace if you can accept

1096
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:18,589
that information now before it becomes

1097
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,930
something bad baby comes

1098
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:23,239
malicious who then leaks customer data

1099
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,609
of thousands tens of thousands millions

1100
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:34,420
of people you know hopefully you can

1101
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:40,400
embrace it yeah any uh anyone else yes

1102
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:42,979
microphone cool thank you my name is you

1103
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,039
smile I just want to ask you in your

1104
00:44:42,979 --> 00:44:49,189
opinion which is the difference between

1105
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:52,279
freedom being under control and VIN

1106
00:44:49,190 --> 00:45:01,069
secure thank you free I'm sorry between

1107
00:44:52,279 --> 00:45:03,710
freedom and and what control control

1108
00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:06,109
because it seems like everything under

1109
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:11,930
control could be our securitisation in

1110
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:15,619
terms of civil people all this area so

1111
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:17,118
what is in your opinion the freedom so

1112
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:19,099
would like an example of encryption

1113
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,719
being exactly what an encryption be an

1114
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:21,829
example of that like how you know

1115
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,589
certain governments want to actually

1116
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:26,119
have back doors in our encryption right

1117
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:34,489
i mean i think that's that's kind of an

1118
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:35,509
issue today uh i think i would say there

1119
00:45:34,489 --> 00:45:37,099
are certain things that I think we

1120
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:40,759
should have freedoms of right i think

1121
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:44,660
the communication right the ability to

1122
00:45:40,759 --> 00:45:46,579
have privacy i think is important i also

1123
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:48,739
believe in transparency but i'd say

1124
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:50,329
let's say let's use encryption as an

1125
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:52,910
example i think it's very important to

1126
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:54,019
have strong encryption we have

1127
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,058
governments that are saying they want

1128
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:57,859
back doors in encryption and only the

1129
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:58,999
government can use strong encryption but

1130
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:00,680
of course if we start back dooring

1131
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:02,899
everything who knows what other bad

1132
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,578
actors might find that back door who

1133
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,619
knows who else might be able to exploit

1134
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:08,029
that and we're not going to know that's

1135
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:10,039
the scariest part you're not going to

1136
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:12,529
know when a bad actor finds something

1137
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:14,450
and is able to exploit that so I think

1138
00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:18,259
we should think with more freedom and

1139
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:21,859
more security and I don't think freedom

1140
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:24,619
and control are necessarily you know

1141
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:26,058
mutually exclusive you can still I think

1142
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:28,779
you can still control plenty you can

1143
00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:31,039
control it say some flow of information

1144
00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:32,410
but there are certain things like

1145
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,700
privacy that I believe

1146
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:36,700
are important Christian are important

1147
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:43,098
and I am definitely more on that side on

1148
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:47,390
the freedom side up there

1149
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:50,869
hola first of all great talk

1150
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:52,848
gratulations sing a song yeah during

1151
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:56,989
your talk you mentioned getting

1152
00:46:52,849 --> 00:47:00,109
educating right so do you have any

1153
00:46:56,989 --> 00:47:02,329
recommendations of people to get started

1154
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:05,029
I mean there's a lot of like reverse

1155
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:09,470
engineering learning how things work

1156
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:11,450
however that it be well but there's so

1157
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,848
much information online how to be

1158
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:17,419
selective where would you advise someone

1159
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:20,089
where to start like four rooms any

1160
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:22,069
specific Brooks oh well what would you

1161
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:23,869
like can you give me an example of

1162
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:28,009
something you like to be better at or

1163
00:47:23,869 --> 00:47:31,400
good at let's say for example breaking

1164
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:36,940
two rotors okay understanding how they

1165
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:39,950
work okay okay um so I would say uh

1166
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,809
doing it yourself like trying to break a

1167
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,999
router right have a goal I think that's

1168
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:45,979
that's the number one thing is having an

1169
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:48,379
actual goal once you know your goal

1170
00:47:45,979 --> 00:47:51,229
let's say it's to break a router right

1171
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:52,640
go home look at the router you have look

1172
00:47:51,229 --> 00:47:54,288
at the manual go through the web

1173
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,089
interface look at all the features and

1174
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:57,920
then start looking at how of other

1175
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:59,900
people broken routers how of other

1176
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,829
people exploited routers so from there

1177
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,420
you're just going to do a search

1178
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:04,729
probably a generic search a Google

1179
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:07,700
search you're probably only going to

1180
00:48:04,729 --> 00:48:10,189
find a dozen maybe it doesn't top ways

1181
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:11,509
of breaking into a router right there's

1182
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,920
probably some cross-site scripting out

1183
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:14,989
there there's probably some firmware

1184
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,579
exploits recently there have been a

1185
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:18,109
couple of router issues where they've

1186
00:48:16,579 --> 00:48:20,119
had passwords that are automatically

1187
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:21,859
generated I would say it's really like a

1188
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,079
google search to find what else have

1189
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:26,119
people done and then as you're learning

1190
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,099
those methods and techniques let's say

1191
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,859
you learn how to break into a router via

1192
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:32,269
cross-site scripting one method now that

1193
00:48:30,859 --> 00:48:35,529
you've understood and you've learned

1194
00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:37,758
this this technique to attack a router

1195
00:48:35,529 --> 00:48:39,380
whenever you work on a new project maybe

1196
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:41,390
tomorrow you working on breaking into a

1197
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,549
cable modem or breaking into a website

1198
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:44,808
you can use all those techniques all

1199
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:47,089
those things that you learn from the

1200
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:49,400
router information to then apply

1201
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:51,619
somewhere else I wouldn't give you any

1202
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,989
specific locations i would say when i

1203
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:55,969
learned i dropped out of high school I

1204
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:56,880
had no formal education any of this so

1205
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:59,220
for me it was also

1206
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,370
learning online and is also testing and

1207
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,890
then also just failing a lot like I fail

1208
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,089
most of the time when I try things but I

1209
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:07,319
find that with every failure I'm

1210
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:09,480
learning something new that will then

1211
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,160
help me in the future in a future attack

1212
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,760
or future software hardware that I

1213
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:17,190
create and then if there were like if I

1214
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:21,560
had to point you in one place to look i

1215
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:24,990
would say certain magazines or there's

1216
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:27,150
something called POC or GTFO which is a

1217
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:29,160
current you know magazine or easy that

1218
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:31,380
you can look at frak is something i grew

1219
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,839
up on and had a lot of had a wealth of

1220
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:36,180
information so i say read frak it

1221
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,280
there's like 50 issues so i mean that'll

1222
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:48,569
take up all your time but that's that's

1223
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:51,240
the place i would start yeah good wait

1224
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:55,140
yeah what one thing more congratulations

1225
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:58,549
on max poof oh thank you haha I was

1226
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,549
happy to release that this week yeah

1227
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,690
okay

1228
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:11,710
Costigan Ock

1229
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:13,810
hello congratulations first of all with

1230
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:18,880
everything you know how did you manage

1231
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:25,860
your time to know unlearn and taste all

1232
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,860
you know right now how did I manage it

1233
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:34,020
I'm not sure I think it's really maybe

1234
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:36,610
allocating it's it's more about

1235
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:39,190
low-hanging fruit right I kind of look

1236
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:41,110
at the areas that I think that I make

1237
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:43,630
estimations are going to be more

1238
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:45,610
vulnerable when Charlie mill and Chris

1239
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:48,070
valasek were looking at the Jeep they

1240
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,480
chose the Jeep specifically they chose

1241
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:53,470
it because it had more features than

1242
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,940
almost any car in that price range it

1243
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:57,490
had all sorts of parallel parking

1244
00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:00,160
features it had Lane Assist it had dr

1245
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:01,899
assist it had you know dynamic cruise

1246
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,509
control it had all of these features

1247
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,550
that most other vehicles didn't so all

1248
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:08,320
they did they said was they assumed that

1249
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:10,120
if with if you have all these new

1250
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,490
features you're gonna have a much larger

1251
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,940
attack surface so when I'm looking when

1252
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:17,919
I'm researching areas maybe what I'll do

1253
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,780
is I'll skip between a few and i'll kind

1254
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,100
of like spend five minutes here spend

1255
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,870
five minutes there's might spend five

1256
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,000
minutes there in like an endless loop

1257
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:26,500
until I think I found something that's

1258
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,680
interesting that really like is

1259
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,150
interesting to me or I think I found the

1260
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,370
vulnerability or something cool to

1261
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:36,340
develop and then I'll just laser in on

1262
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:38,410
that area so a lot of my time is really

1263
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:40,090
spread between all sorts of areas until

1264
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:42,220
I find something that sparks my interest

1265
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:45,160
where I think I can do something cool

1266
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,689
and I'd also say another thing that I've

1267
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,629
learned over the years is everything is

1268
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,650
vulnerable everything if you look at

1269
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:53,250
something you're going to find a

1270
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:55,450
vulnerability so now it's less about

1271
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:59,460
hoping that it's going to be easier it's

1272
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:59,460
like if you look you will find something

1273
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:06,160
a question over here

1274
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:13,319
hello hello I just wanted to ask how do

1275
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:16,339
you make a living out of these for

1276
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:18,930
example you find some vulnerability and

1277
00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:21,450
what's what would you do after that you

1278
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:23,910
contact the company and try to get a

1279
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:26,519
reward for that or you pull with that in

1280
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:32,670
in a magazine or you'll give a speech

1281
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:34,680
about it how do you do ah I am I don't

1282
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:37,170
make too much money off security this is

1283
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:40,140
like this is brilliant this is more my

1284
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:41,670
my hobby I think it's however there are

1285
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,440
a lot of people who do bug bounty

1286
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:45,450
programs I have friends who exclusively

1287
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,819
do bug bounty programs all they do is

1288
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:49,529
they sit on facebook they look at

1289
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:50,849
pictures and then they like look for

1290
00:52:49,529 --> 00:52:52,289
vulnerabilities and then switch back to

1291
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:55,140
pictures and this respective owner

1292
00:52:52,289 --> 00:52:57,510
abilities and they find exploits in

1293
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,980
Google and Facebook and then send ya do

1294
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:01,980
the bug bounties that's one way of

1295
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,720
making money you know another thing that

1296
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,579
you can do is research you could go to a

1297
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,078
company like duo security and do

1298
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,059
research for them they actually have a

1299
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:09,900
research branch a labs where all they're

1300
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:12,990
doing is they're looking for new

1301
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:15,869
exploits and new vulnerabilities and all

1302
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:17,669
they're doing that they do that and they

1303
00:53:15,869 --> 00:53:23,400
issue patches right they're not

1304
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:25,289
monetizing that personally I I monetize

1305
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,269
development so I do like software and

1306
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:30,269
hardware development so right now I'm

1307
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:32,220
doing autonomous drone software and

1308
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:33,538
hardware so I'm building drones that are

1309
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,640
actually that are capable of using

1310
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:38,609
computer vision and software to

1311
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:44,990
autonomously land take off fly and do

1312
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:44,990
other interesting things sure

1313
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:50,410
hmm

1314
00:53:54,950 --> 00:54:02,879
thank you I all set before I almost and

1315
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:05,849
everything is wonderful hey where do you

1316
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:09,330
think the lines would be between Koshien

1317
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:11,730
and paranoia I mean everyone can draw

1318
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:14,430
their own line and so I think about I

1319
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:16,520
think about sort of the risk the pros

1320
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:20,660
and cons right but by having a

1321
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:23,280
smartphone I'm more prone to to risks

1322
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:25,740
there's a lot a lot larger attack

1323
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,420
surface here in general I might keep

1324
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,939
things off I'll keep bluetooth off if I

1325
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:32,550
don't use it it's not a big issue to

1326
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,750
keep bluetooth off for me some people

1327
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,670
who are more paranoid than me we'll just

1328
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,260
keep their phone off I don't like

1329
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:39,869
waiting for this thing to start up and

1330
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,810
and shut down so that time is not worth

1331
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:47,340
it to me I just you know you have to

1332
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:49,410
find an acceptable level of whether you

1333
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:51,270
think you'll be targeted how important

1334
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:55,049
your information is how bad is it if

1335
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:58,530
your information is leaked mm-hmm excuse

1336
00:54:55,050 --> 00:55:00,060
me um i would say personally i'm okay

1337
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:02,400
with being hacked like I'm going to be

1338
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:04,290
act it's going to happen so I'm just

1339
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,980
trying to accept it now so that when it

1340
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:09,509
happens it's not a big surprise and

1341
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,430
because I love technology I want to use

1342
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:13,859
this stuff I want to use this technology

1343
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:15,720
so I do leave myself a little bit more

1344
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:17,369
vulnerable than others where I'd say if

1345
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,259
you're more paranoid and you care about

1346
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:21,240
your privacy more you care about your

1347
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,440
information not getting leaked more then

1348
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,540
I would say don't use certain features

1349
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,750
right if you can disable a feature of

1350
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:30,839
something do it just in your phone in

1351
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:33,330
your laptop online you know use less

1352
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:34,830
cloud services i use cloud services

1353
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,270
knowing that one of these cloud services

1354
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:38,160
is going to get hacked and my date is

1355
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:40,859
going to get leaked right we can just

1356
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,080
assume that so it's it's kind of what

1357
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:44,759
your what your own risk assessment is

1358
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:50,630
and what your own paranoia level is

1359
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:50,630
where you feel comfortable thanks

1360
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:56,280
thank you thank you thank you very much
