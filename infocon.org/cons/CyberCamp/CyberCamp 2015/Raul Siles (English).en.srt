1
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:27,869
vamos a empezar la esta tarde homos no

2
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,640
viste i'll write this afternoon we will

3
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,000
be talking about mobile devices and

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,719
about the good the bad and the ugly well

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,430
perhaps ev-do having read the

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,750
description of this style of these

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,219
presentations you don't know what we

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,079
will be talking about when we talk about

9
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,289
the good bad and the ugly and mobile

10
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,930
devices someone may think about well

11
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:55,440
these ones these icons on the screen

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:58,140
okay so the idea is that well for the

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,480
next hour I know that it is like if

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,589
you're bad time of the day after lunch

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,649
would like to look at the security of

16
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:11,360
mobile phones and then the use of Remy's

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,479
use all the technology and problems

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:19,350
resulting from dash we are all aware

19
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,689
devices are targeted for attackers so

20
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,059
let us discuss three elements that are

21
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,139
involved in that so first of all

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,229
behaviors or producers sometimes when

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,780
the doors are open to possible potential

24
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,119
attackers then we will also look at

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,049
integration with the platform of the

26
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,450
manufacturer and then the security

27
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:46,799
vulnerabilities that are published on an

28
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:49,350
ongoing basis and when we need to update

29
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,450
our reserves well for you to have a feel

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:56,259
as the mobile devices that

31
00:01:51,450 --> 00:02:00,460
markets so these Ximena statistics so

32
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:03,100
between iOS and Android ninety-five

33
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,229
percent of the market is shed well we

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,210
have windows phone which is there seems

35
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:09,610
to be growing but not very much and then

36
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,310
blackberry and other major players that

37
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,530
disappears as you can see Android and

38
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,020
iOS account for ninety percent of the

39
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,959
market small s all right there is a

40
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,940
start with the good guy and I'm going to

41
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,640
ask you a number of questions to finds

42
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,070
us about the reality so I would like to

43
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,399
have more interaction so let us start

44
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,890
off with the good man pretty low okay

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,730
and I'd like to know whether I do have

46
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,950
the latest OS in your mobile phone

47
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,750
please raise your hands okay you know

48
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,000
that do you believe that you have the

49
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:48,820
latest one which is the latest Android

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,890
version all right six okay Oh as six for

51
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:57,130
Android and actually which subversion

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:03:00,488
which subversion well because now we

53
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:05,170
have entered a very strange cycle where

54
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:07,209
we'll have less unusual objects and we

55
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,890
really need to know about that you know

56
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,470
whether you have the latest version or

57
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:16,869
not so what about iOS who's got the

58
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:21,010
latest is OS okay last one is latest is

59
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:24,040
9.1 and well sometimes too don't have

60
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,890
the latest version we've got to get to

61
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,650
the top time to update sometimes it

62
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,869
takes weeks to update you os or

63
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,850
sometimes you may not be lucky enough

64
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,209
and then the manufacturers your device

65
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:39,070
may not release any updates okay and the

66
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:42,070
only way for you to have fun the latest

67
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,079
is just change your device do you think

68
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,070
that the latest version released by

69
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:49,700
manufacturers resolve all the known

70
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,370
vulnerabilities for that device really

71
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,129
so on only few people lucky I can see

72
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,040
that not very many people trust

73
00:03:54,129 --> 00:04:01,340
manufacturers because only few hands

74
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,190
have been raised well you are right okay

75
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,160
they resolve those vulnerabilities that

76
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,650
are publicly known but some of them that

77
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,239
are not publicly known are not resolved

78
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,519
let us say that these are the

79
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,000
vulnerabilities that operates in the

80
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,160
Greenmarket dry markets and now these

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,330
are the latest statistics published by

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,330
Google about the number of users and

83
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:28,280
versions of the OSS that Avengers so

84
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,909
we'll have a problem because you nearly

85
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,770
40-percent of users have version 4.5

86
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,470
that is to say there are two versions

87
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,049
behind and then there is a large

88
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:43,250
proportion of users as I said that have

89
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:45,710
even oldest versions and because there

90
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,940
are some vulnerabilities in version four

91
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:52,880
and earlier than that devices good

92
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,550
number of devices may be compromised so

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,919
we have had android for ideas now how

94
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,860
many of their abilities have appeared so

95
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,969
would like to have a guess who'd like to

96
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:08,060
an app rocks number up we just don't

97
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:11,090
know okay it is unknown the number of

98
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,760
vulnerabilities is not known there was

99
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,760
no official site owner official place

100
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:21,409
with vulnerabilities are being recorded

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:25,520
and then okay so there is no possibility

102
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:30,380
to track that surprisingly enough for

103
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:34,150
Nexus devices since last august's we

104
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,849
know the number of official

105
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:40,820
vulnerabilities well so far we have had

106
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:42,800
52 which is not bad that is to say fifty

107
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,770
two things that you have to take

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,050
seriously what do you think about Eyres

109
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,979
well they've been there for nine years

110
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:55,539
so how many vulnerabilities there who

111
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,539
says more than for Android

112
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:02,730
well but I OC safer than Android starts

113
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,710
the general message but some of you well

114
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,920
more people believe that I just have

115
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:13,700
more vulnerabilities well in previous

116
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:17,820
versions of iOS 6 and 7 we had 198 then

117
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:20,580
120 and what happens with iOS 8 how many

118
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:27,000
do you think we had in all the different

119
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:30,450
versions of iOS aids 272 only for iOS 8

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,360
and is nine since it was published

121
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:36,270
September this year couple of months we

122
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,050
have had already 151 which is not bad at

123
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:43,950
all therefore it seems that devices are

124
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,280
vulnerable so I might as well updates my

125
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:49,979
device and now let us move on to the

126
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,760
ugly to the ugly guy and now my question

127
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:59,030
is how many of you have an account are

128
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:02,280
you manufacturers chasm ok Google Play

129
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,729
etc ok most of you for how long have you

130
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:09,359
had that account when did you create it

131
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,030
the beginning when you configure it when

132
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,480
you installed your device you are kind

133
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:18,619
of force or obliged to open up an

134
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:22,380
account when you configure your device

135
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,650
just to access to the cloud services to

136
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:29,040
buy at the App Store to download

137
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,020
multimedia boots etc so it seems to be

138
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,960
important to have an account and then

139
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:37,380
what about the user of those accounts is

140
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,349
it known what is the user that you have

141
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,620
to use to use those accounts well the

142
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,900
username is often the email well ok you

143
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,510
are safe you are secure because no one

144
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,500
is aware of your email address ok you

145
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,300
are all the time sending out emails so

146
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,610
what is protecting your account when

147
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,980
well the password and what about the

148
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:05,100
password that you have is it robustness

149
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:08,950
is it long enough so you don't it's a

150
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:12,160
one a single one a unique one you never

151
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:17,080
write it down on a post-it notes etc I'm

152
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:21,460
sure that now okay let us reflect upon

153
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,680
that attackers we try to break into your

154
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,010
password that's one of their objectives

155
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:31,630
and now I'd like to show you very

156
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:34,720
briefly what an attacker could do if he

157
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,669
is to access your account on from one of

158
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,970
those platforms so we'll have a google

159
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:43,840
play there we have an Android device I

160
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:50,770
would switch it on so we will be using

161
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:52,510
it for our demos and use an account on

162
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:55,390
that platform that is to say Android

163
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:58,210
with Google Play if an attacker will

164
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:00,280
tell you credentials this is the same

165
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,470
for Microsoft and Apple and if the

166
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,530
attacker will have access to Google Play

167
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:08,440
could go there could just find out about

168
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:12,640
the apps that you download it and could

169
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:15,010
select and remotely install any of the

170
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,410
applications that you bought so here we

171
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,410
don't have an applique we have a root

172
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:23,020
checker application and weather has been

173
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,420
installed or not before still there is a

174
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,550
list of the devices registered in the

175
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,040
platform so we choose the target device

176
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,469
we ask you to install is it tells us to

177
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,959
wait and you can if connectivities all

178
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:37,750
rights we can see another saying that

179
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,260
the app is being downloaded and then it

180
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,900
is installing it and then we get it

181
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,450
right away in here with no intervention

182
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:49,840
on the part of the user with without

183
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:53,200
improving any permits etc so your

184
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,130
credentials are you mobile phone so if I

185
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,880
have control on about on one over one of

186
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,970
them I have control over the other so

187
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:08,570
is the conclusion of this scenario so

188
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:11,850
once we are clear about the threat and

189
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:15,000
this problem okay we move on to the next

190
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,930
step which is the bad guy all right so

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,560
we have some more questions now what

192
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:26,430
makes current mobile phones to be smart

193
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,530
okay why do we say that we are they are

194
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:32,930
smart well but is the main

195
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,930
characteristics for them to be smart

196
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,500
right they have the capacity to install

197
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,400
applications that is to say

198
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,470
functionality is being extended okay in

199
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,000
the past with previous phones that

200
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:52,830
capacity was limited do you install

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,400
applications in your phone's ok well let

202
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:59,160
us put it the other way around ok press

203
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,590
0 handles could do not install apps ok

204
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,990
what for well for whatever reason

205
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:08,310
personal use professional you used games

206
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:10,890
productivity several purposes all right

207
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,869
what did you install them from and this

208
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:16,890
is a key element that we want to reflect

209
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:19,230
upon what are the markets I hope that

210
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:22,800
you use the official ones Google Play

211
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,290
App Store markets Windows Phone or could

212
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,250
be third-party markets when there are

213
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:32,510
third-party markets that are relatively

214
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:36,000
reliable for instance such as Amazon for

215
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:38,580
android ok has a good reputation but

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,240
still this is the third party market is

217
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:45,360
not the official market and now we also

218
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,940
have to consider who are the developers

219
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,340
behind the applications that we are

220
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,620
installing well we may have an

221
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:56,570
independent developer or a large

222
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,970
corporation so do you trust them equally

223
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:05,209
or not what are the criteria that you

224
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:08,029
follow to trust developers so nowadays

225
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:11,268
we mourn the not so gay full of

226
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:14,529
reputation and then reputation is like

227
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:17,720
well this app has been there for a year

228
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:21,619
he has been developed by a developer

229
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:26,499
that looks serious it's got like four

230
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:29,660
stars in ratings move comments and not

231
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:32,449
negative okay it is the third version

232
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,449
now ok I'm going to tank notice because

233
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:38,719
the reputation is good so the criteria

234
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:41,748
is as started attach meaning that there

235
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,350
is no certification nothing talent shows

236
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:48,410
you that applications are secure ok what

237
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,309
do we have on the screen now 1.5 million

238
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:55,759
one hundred thousand million so what do

239
00:12:52,309 --> 00:13:01,759
you think that is stands for what is

240
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:04,369
that ok 1.5 million is number of apps in

241
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:08,779
each of these markets google play well

242
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:13,129
more than 1.5 and Napster also over 1.5

243
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:16,189
million apps so how many are secure

244
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:20,679
which one have boner abilities which one

245
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:23,959
shall I trust ok so 100 million is the

246
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:29,540
number of zen loads of the apps that

247
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:32,719
have that it's in both these markets so

248
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,269
it is a serious number so we can see

249
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,449
that people actually download and

250
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:42,350
install applications and now let me show

251
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:43,849
you one of the google play apps that was

252
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,519
there for quite some time unfortunately

253
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:49,279
i cannot show it to you because it

254
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,100
disappeared two months ago so we could

255
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:56,360
refer to it as Manuel but I'd like you

256
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:59,360
to coin your own terminology your own

257
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,640
term to refer to this malware so imagine

258
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,240
that whoa

259
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:09,630
these words have free up okay so your

260
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:18,610
phone is transformed is changed into

261
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:21,640
scales so you can wait and items okay so

262
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,380
we know that sensors have phones have

263
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,449
lots of sensors but as far as I know

264
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:30,370
there is no balance sensors so that

265
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:37,860
application has been there since 2006

266
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:42,520
and 6,500 people have rated that up then

267
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:46,120
101 1180 people have recommended it in

268
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,060
the store platform and then it has been

269
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,760
downloaded more than 1 million times so

270
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:54,459
many people have installed it so it

271
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,920
seems that we want to wait objects and

272
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,020
this is a dynamic application it means

273
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,540
oh it's so cool i'm going to install it

274
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,520
and then if it is a static and i said no

275
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,939
i don't want to have any static up in

276
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,670
2015 but then there is the notification

277
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,970
because perhaps well the white

278
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:16,829
measurement is not fully accurate right

279
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:22,930
on top of that the rating is 1.9 and

280
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:27,160
then we also see a figure here between a

281
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:30,520
million and 1.5 million people that is

282
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,959
to say potential victims okay in now

283
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:36,850
looking at the permissions or permits

284
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,700
well the application is asking us about

285
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,860
our location to measure objects yes

286
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:45,490
because based on whether you are on the

287
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:49,800
North hemisphere who suffered hemisphere

288
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:52,570
of course well you get a different

289
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,939
measurements okay no of course not that

290
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:58,210
is not true okay it is just stealing

291
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:00,010
your location and now even want of the

292
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,800
code you don't need to be experts in the

293
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:05,870
code so the first ever generates a

294
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:11,020
variable with a random number and then

295
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:15,860
function says when you touch screen so

296
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:18,770
then a function is called hand and well

297
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,250
there is a fluctuation is a random

298
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:25,339
number and it seems that your object is

299
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:28,339
being wait it is not accurate because it

300
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:31,870
is random but it is scales it is a

301
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:34,279
balance and then well many people just

302
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,230
downloaded it and said well we are

303
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:39,560
giving the app for free we are only

304
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,960
stealing photographs and location and

305
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,800
from people and I say okay let us

306
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:48,020
release the pro version okay ninety

307
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:53,300
cents okay and now we want several users

308
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:56,180
to pay for it so it took them two years

309
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:00,829
okay to release this profession and to

310
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:03,199
start charging for it and some more

311
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:06,709
information we see that they've reviews

312
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,350
and the ratings are higher so this is a

313
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,000
cultural thing okay if you pay for

314
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:13,069
something even if you are getting the

315
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,619
same trap okay you give it a higher

316
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:18,290
rating and I said well the previous one

317
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:20,899
was free okay was not as good as is this

318
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,879
one which is pay one and then the

319
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,420
descriptions are exactly the same well

320
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,300
has no words has been updated and

321
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:33,050
improved in terms of the users

322
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:36,309
experience okay so that says that it has

323
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:39,530
no ads continues to be a dynamic

324
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:43,370
application and then the summary is that

325
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:48,050
the measurements or the will never be

326
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:51,469
accurate and then you know many people

327
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:54,500
have installed it so it is very

328
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:57,679
important now to see that they are not

329
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:01,580
only this time they are not asking you

330
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,850
for your location okay so they are not

331
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,409
stealing your location so this is a huge

332
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,990
fail it

333
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:11,930
it is like hydronephrosis if this thick

334
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:16,040
chain breaks and then you decide to fix

335
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:18,620
it with this piece of plastic and well

336
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,260
there are scenarios such as this one has

337
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,810
an alter who needs to be protected from

338
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:27,260
whom the mobile from the user or the

339
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:30,169
user from the mobile so this is thing as

340
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,090
this bicycle lane okay depends on you

341
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,280
whether to use it or not but if I were

342
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:38,300
you I wouldn't use it and wouldn't use

343
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:41,149
it myself so with all these pieces but

344
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:47,180
I'd like you to focus next don't song a

345
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:51,110
demo so we try to bring all these parts

346
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:53,870
together and just to give some color to

347
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:57,110
all these elements the good day ugly and

348
00:18:53,870 --> 00:19:00,260
bad and to see how far an attack it

349
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,870
Tucker could get and for you to see how

350
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:07,300
easy is it to take control over a device

351
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:11,270
and to be successful it's in your attack

352
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:15,560
later on a move on to conclusions now

353
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:18,530
demo time so well the application has

354
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:21,440
been already installed and now we have

355
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,899
an attacker environment for those of you

356
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,580
that mode technicians with technical

357
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:31,610
with honey II Linux so foreign intrusion

358
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:35,629
attack and now we will be generated an

359
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:38,659
Android Apple which is based on net

360
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:42,290
exploit so it give us remote access to

361
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,780
control in mobile device so only with

362
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:49,720
this command that's what we need for the

363
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:53,560
metal bridge meta prater meta Prater dot

364
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:56,660
8pk which is an app that to be insulting

365
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:58,490
Android that's it I could transfer that

366
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,240
up to my analyst equipment and just

367
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:06,290
start to play around with it if I tell

368
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,110
this matter prett to a victim well the

369
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:12,680
victim is likely not to execute it so

370
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:17,209
let us do a trick and try to insert that

371
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:22,159
met report within a blanket so that use

372
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:24,169
install the legitimate up and then by

373
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,919
the time he will be using the

374
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:32,690
application he will also be the user

375
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,640
will also connect with us so we are not

376
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,419
talking about an application which is

377
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:43,070
ver novel and because so I can do it now

378
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:46,640
I can do that in the 1.5 million apps

379
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:51,049
available at Google Play okay because

380
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,840
this demo is Android demo so i have

381
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:56,210
chosen one which is color it's a game

382
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,949
well make sure some of you played it

383
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:05,270
before and we will be using an APK tool

384
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:08,690
and then too we will reassemble it it

385
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:11,029
will take the android app and it will

386
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,850
kind of break it down for us so that we

387
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:16,039
can see how it works internally so we

388
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:21,049
will do exactly the same with the

389
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:23,960
ethical tool with metal printer so i

390
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:26,990
have exactly the same thing i have the

391
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:29,960
assembled both applications now they are

392
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,860
accessible to me once I have them those

393
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:36,950
I will bring them together so this is it

394
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:39,469
slightly more technical but this is for

395
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,600
you to see that this is not that

396
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:45,110
complicated since it's not complicated

397
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,539
so I will take color right away and I

398
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:50,330
will put it into this folder that I

399
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:53,240
referred to it as combined folder where

400
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,908
I will be combining both apps so in the

401
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,490
case of metro praetor I will not include

402
00:21:55,909 --> 00:22:03,169
it fully but i would just include the

403
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:05,809
code so the code that my agent was

404
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:07,970
implementing that's the code that i want

405
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:13,059
to insert in here I going to combine

406
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:16,549
folder so how we look for the path to

407
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:20,779
reference the code and now i will paste

408
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:22,970
the new code what is next now i have to

409
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:26,240
go to met reporter

410
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,580
and to look at the function that is

411
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,880
called out to integrate that code and I

412
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,740
want the other up to call it so when i

413
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,990
run the applications i want bounce

414
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,090
applications my agents and the other apt

415
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,309
to be run and also will be very

416
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,699
important for me to be able to adjust

417
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:46,100
the permits of the application and do it

418
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:49,039
depending on what I want my agent to do

419
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,908
for me I will edit the Android manifest

420
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:55,760
that as you know is the file regulating

421
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:58,990
the permits of the application and I

422
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,870
will just paste an extra number of fam

423
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:06,380
mints or permissions and then here we

424
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:09,408
can be very selective we can paste just

425
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:12,049
the permissions that we need or just a

426
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:14,780
few of them still I would like to place

427
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:18,590
them all because I'd like you to see all

428
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:23,000
the capabilities of the applications

429
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:27,860
after pasting all the permissions and

430
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:33,020
now we will include the code the code

431
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:36,080
that will invoke the execution of it so

432
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:39,080
we go to the metal Prater we look for

433
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,610
the code now and now we go into this

434
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:45,939
file main activity file ok I'll open it

435
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,939
now

436
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:57,509
we open it with a text editor and at a

437
00:23:53,879 --> 00:24:02,879
given point we see that this invokes the

438
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:07,559
start method so this is the assembly

439
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:09,178
code of the Android Android machine ok

440
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:13,080
this is what Android applications

441
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:17,909
execute so this is the start method that

442
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:21,649
will start the app so we copy and paste

443
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:24,870
this line and this line will allow us to

444
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:27,508
start this mode and where do we paste it

445
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:32,479
we paste it in the host application

446
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:35,759
which is to say the combined application

447
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,700
so we will look for the code of this

448
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:43,230
application as far as I can remember it

449
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:48,470
was here and the first activity was this

450
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,470
one start activity we open it

451
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:07,070
so we open it with a text editor it is

452
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:10,399
open now and once we have that we really

453
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:14,090
want to see the function that is invoked

454
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:19,459
when I run the application and that

455
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:22,279
method is hungry ate and I executed when

456
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:26,299
actually idea but you have to do just to

457
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:30,470
paste the invocation of the other agents

458
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:33,320
okay what we paste it here before now we

459
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:36,260
taste this other thing by the time the

460
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,450
code is open they will execute both the

461
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:42,350
agents as well as the application that's

462
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:45,950
the idea of it and now what is left well

463
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,990
once we have everything organized if I

464
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,230
have not forgotten anything which i

465
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:58,580
believe i have not we will generate the

466
00:25:51,230 --> 00:26:03,500
first installable package so we download

467
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:07,158
the combined file or folder and then i

468
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:10,640
will be using the APK too but this time

469
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:14,929
i will have asked you to build the color

470
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,630
application and that will include all

471
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:22,070
the modifications that we have made and

472
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:25,880
then it will assembly the code and then

473
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:31,399
we will have our APK ready so the next

474
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:36,799
step is to sign that apk and for that we

475
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:39,320
will become Android developers for us to

476
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,559
avoid a lot of stroking and Keem I'm

477
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:46,990
copy and paste basically over here so i

478
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:49,879
use the tools of java to generate the

479
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:52,850
certifications from the developer the

480
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:56,500
great advantage i got her here is I have

481
00:26:52,850 --> 00:27:00,668
to put in a password in the repository

482
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:04,029
we can cute any value representing any

483
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:08,590
developer whatsoever i can say i am

484
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:08,590
first name cyber cam

485
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:15,390
organization's name in psybeam

486
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:20,910
organization in Eunice the Scarlet

487
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:27,630
events organization incising where is

488
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:29,570
located Leon well and not unless point

489
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:34,080
to put the whole Autonomous Region name

490
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:37,470
it will take me longer so far so good is

491
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,320
this correct the developer is good for

492
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:43,020
me to have all this data yes they are I

493
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,939
i might have said on Twitter Facebook

494
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,100
Microsoft whatever application it is i

495
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,050
can even replicate the originals from

496
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,449
this application so far as they get this

497
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:53,820
is it I donate my own certificate to

498
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:58,350
sign applications the next step is to

499
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:00,179
sign it with one other remaining two on

500
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:04,530
Java for the developers with this jet

501
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:07,470
signer can you please sign this APK with

502
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:10,889
the certificate I've just generated and

503
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:15,330
the please let me show you to you when

504
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:20,970
we had rebuilt we have storage here this

505
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:24,720
is new one this is a new apk modified so

506
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:30,110
I'd like to do as photos we go back over

507
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:32,910
here we paste it over here with chains

508
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:36,929
we change the one which is signed and

509
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:39,510
then not signed or unsigned i put here

510
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:41,670
this is the design one I kept another

511
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,620
backup copy of this day of the

512
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:47,490
certificate and I indicate this is that

513
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,739
a sign certificate so I said please siam

514
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:53,430
sign the certificate with the skull find

515
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,310
it so I tell him please sign it I given

516
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:59,100
the password for the repository I think

517
00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:02,730
I think I type it in raleigh i created

518
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:07,409
this password before and the APK is

519
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:10,290
correctly science which allows me to

520
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:11,500
straight in any other doors forever what

521
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:16,300
can I do

522
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:19,480
I can upload it onto google play play at

523
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,909
all from their people would be able to

524
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,040
download it and install it unless they

525
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:26,440
do detected as malicious as you put it

526
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,440
on Amazon I can put it on my website I

527
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,530
can share them distributed all over my

528
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,080
people for the purpose of simplicity

529
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,990
it's not about uploading things and

530
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,850
things over and over again doubtfully we

531
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:44,200
don't one if we don't want this into the

532
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:46,600
markets let's be straight locally so you

533
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,570
can see the one sec on the camera if we

534
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,730
go to this camera that the way around

535
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,429
I'm going to install this application

536
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,880
locally as since I've felt download him

537
00:29:54,430 --> 00:30:00,010
from the market or I see them

538
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,070
compromising attack here install it in

539
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:07,090
my store by finding the same procedure

540
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:10,179
I'm going this allow me to come friend I

541
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:14,530
am where I should be I I got the color

542
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:18,400
fine locally installed on the device we

543
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:20,550
got it here if we quickly move into the

544
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,980
camera we got it the application color

545
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:25,899
appears as we do actually previously the

546
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,790
room narrative locations the techart

547
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,790
proceeds as follows that I can make

548
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:33,100
being interested in attacking forces

549
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,430
attacking me with this application for

550
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,230
this purpose is going to set up his own

551
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:39,760
infrastructure with an environment where

552
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,970
the attack ethics is waiting for

553
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,160
connections for the malicious

554
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:47,170
applications to control remotely the

555
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,380
devices would be that the purpose that

556
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,910
the quintessence lesson check out we

557
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,040
have connectivity with the model phone

558
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:57,520
we got it perfect connectivity with my

559
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:00,730
mobile smartphone so with meta exploit

560
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,700
on the server par instead of the part of

561
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,890
the age we generate the attacking

562
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,040
environment this is the attacker server

563
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:10,540
I launched the attacker server which is

564
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,909
running through it what is going to

565
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:16,750
happen when the victim previously

566
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:18,820
install the application touch it then it

567
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:22,150
started the application is going to

568
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,610
establish connection it versus net gains

569
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,130
a

570
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:28,580
the attacker server without noticing the

571
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:31,460
user the victim continues to play the

572
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:35,570
original occation but in that other line

573
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:39,110
this person unknowingly is executing a

574
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:41,059
good man of attacks we got them cover

575
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:44,540
l'application we're still in the

576
00:31:41,059 --> 00:31:46,730
connection with his double the triple

577
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:48,500
several color applications user is

578
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,570
playing with colors within the matrix

579
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,670
its course very well with the camera the

580
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:56,168
user is playing around with this again

581
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:58,940
without noticing he is blacked out

582
00:31:56,169 --> 00:32:02,210
there's so many problems of connectivity

583
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,100
but we are focused on executing this

584
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,820
application we listen to what is

585
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:12,159
happening and is as follows next time

586
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:15,439
the user comes back to execute the game

587
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,000
that the users connects again but we

588
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,419
connected that when we started nishat

589
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,750
application every time you play again or

590
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:25,940
Richard score the mechanism connects

591
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,919
with the rest of things we have the

592
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:33,020
session started and I can start seeing

593
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:36,309
things one sec let's enlarge the image

594
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:41,270
in order to see better image everything

595
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:47,500
let's try to get system commands we have

596
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:50,660
different commands it doesn't load mmm

597
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:53,299
android the available modules allowing

598
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:57,080
us to actions this capacities so let's

599
00:32:53,299 --> 00:33:01,220
try not just him because the very first

600
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:04,070
session died and expires out of time so

601
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:07,700
we've got connectivity province in here

602
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:10,909
so let's launch the attack in the

603
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,850
scenario once more by launching the

604
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,830
server once we got get it if you

605
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:19,580
connectivity is Greg let's launch the

606
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:22,520
application this up so let's hold the

607
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,889
demo gods don't play around them mess

608
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,830
around with this demonstration let's

609
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:30,380
hope we got a good connectivity we

610
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:33,590
receive the connection or modules are

611
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,990
common away here we can execute emphasis

612
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:38,600
for iron 144 for

613
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:41,390
we can do things are just seeing the

614
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,850
executing process I will see this is my

615
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:47,030
current executed process with the up

616
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:49,969
color we are executing we I can even

617
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:53,420
obtain a seven to execute this

618
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:55,520
application see what user I am but I'm

619
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,530
not privileged user I'm the user

620
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,690
associated with this application is this

621
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:03,139
very case so there are little things i

622
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:06,740
can use us I am these applications users

623
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,379
prison I can access the camera on the

624
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:12,918
mobile phone I can go to the essay card

625
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:20,089
the folder fin so where objects are kept

626
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:22,819
and in here I can in principle the slow

627
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:25,810
connection so i can get images from the

628
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:30,040
camera i can download one of the images

629
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:33,469
such as this people can have

630
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:36,199
confidential highly moving images and

631
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:39,408
pictures of their devices so let's not

632
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:44,509
one of these image do 20 connectivity

633
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:47,389
issues it was a very big capacity image

634
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,730
it would take us longer to download the

635
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,210
same is so with an attack I can access

636
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:56,510
all my information on the my device

637
00:34:52,210 --> 00:35:00,380
images documents likely passwords and so

638
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:02,950
on so on so we may run out of time and

639
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:08,840
we don't have time for everything even

640
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:13,319
drops files compromising images in my

641
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:16,920
device such as something like this when

642
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:19,199
the deep amps went into the cyber

643
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,680
account for the very first time nobody

644
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:25,049
knows that the m's are getting the this

645
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,868
turnstile didn't know you got pictures

646
00:35:25,049 --> 00:35:29,430
from them so on song what other things

647
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:33,089
the attacker can do i will show you

648
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:36,269
things related to this injuries written

649
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:41,279
it happen you have drop box i can access

650
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:47,609
dropbox files if I am downloaded files

651
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:50,789
on the S car area I will get interesting

652
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:53,910
files store there is in singer download

653
00:35:50,789 --> 00:35:56,699
in the singular character done so i can

654
00:35:53,910 --> 00:36:00,328
download images final documents and so

655
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:02,630
on so what are things I can do Frison

656
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:07,199
did they get a module that allows you to

657
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:09,539
record on the micron can you record on

658
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:12,180
the victim microphone fortune these

659
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:16,969
seconds or 10 seconds so I can access

660
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:19,890
the recording they have kept it M

661
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:23,430
recorded on a fire I access it this file

662
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:26,640
and I turned on these microphone from

663
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:33,269
this virtual machine or in order to hear

664
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:39,390
it i would need that the audio t would

665
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:41,788
activate now now we were hearing thank

666
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:44,578
you thank you very much we noticed we

667
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:48,299
recorded what we were saying because we

668
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:51,319
have permission to record the audio what

669
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:54,059
else can we do we can list the webkinz

670
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:57,029
associated on my device first how many

671
00:36:54,059 --> 00:37:00,490
webcast are listed the front webcam and

672
00:36:57,029 --> 00:37:06,840
the back webcam and i can do a webcam

673
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:10,060
and take a picture less webcam is nab

674
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:14,700
let's see please a smile in front of the

675
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:18,160
camera and you'll get a position image

676
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,379
you notice that the user that's a no

677
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,210
anything the user continues playing and

678
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,040
messing with this is smartphone without

679
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:27,880
knowing what is happening with this

680
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:30,520
device we have so many Wi-Fi networks

681
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:35,320
but we got it on screen you can see

682
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:37,869
there is a big zoom so I'm going to move

683
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:43,690
it around I meant you to get a smaller

684
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:46,410
image let's reduce the zoom in and we

685
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:49,330
have access to this camera as we

686
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:55,270
accessed the audio what else can we do

687
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:59,440
we can dump the cause MSA as contacts

688
00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:02,259
into another device let's go to contacts

689
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,530
and we dumped all the contacts three

690
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:10,750
contacts on my model form into another

691
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:14,010
device MSS I can dampen the course I can

692
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:16,840
geolocate things with this device

693
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:19,630
geolocate without further ado we are

694
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:22,350
inside the it's giving Mac is giving me

695
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:27,880
correct coordinates so now we are

696
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:30,819
located on on the space let's see how

697
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,090
precise everything is MIT into google

698
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:36,730
map and let's try to get these latitude

699
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:44,800
and longitude uncle map how these are

700
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:48,280
working here connection a week we got a

701
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,210
spot on we are on the spot precisely on

702
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,030
barclays guard centum the quarters so

703
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,830
let's check out the context and the

704
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:59,140
phone calls here on phone calls in

705
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,029
context we got the list of contacts as

706
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,460
you can see the President the Vice

707
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:08,510
President and a little Nicholas

708
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:11,900
we got so many contacts on the phone and

709
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:17,660
the same applies to SMS and SMS with a

710
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:21,290
key from the little necklace in dev we

711
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:25,160
got everything from the device there is

712
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:27,920
an issue over here we don't have a total

713
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,470
control over the device we so we are the

714
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,680
user associated to the application which

715
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:37,819
means that we dis which we should have

716
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:41,118
the whole control we're lucky now let's

717
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,460
try to exploit another low profile

718
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,980
vulgarity in order to ask i'll add

719
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,770
privileges in the device and take over

720
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:52,250
from the holes device i'm going to shut

721
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:56,089
down this sessions momentarily i'm going

722
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:59,990
to use another expert available on met

723
00:39:56,089 --> 00:40:03,410
expired effect in hundred 444 or in

724
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:05,209
theory categories almost accounts to

725
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:08,089
seventy percent of devices on the market

726
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:12,140
in the market millions millions minutes

727
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:15,020
of devices this is food has read request

728
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:18,920
has to make the most of this number

729
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:22,880
session one and we are going to tell him

730
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:25,970
don't do not load the android keyed

731
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,560
available because do not do so because

732
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:31,609
we we have it complete why we don't we

733
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,799
don't need this functionality of

734
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:37,098
recording the camera the microphone we

735
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:42,380
don't need how this has to be connected

736
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:45,589
to us the local host is us the attacker

737
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:50,150
server with the correct IP and the poor

738
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:53,330
you have to connect is this is 443 which

739
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:55,790
is used to it https is a good option so

740
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:58,119
we let's cross fingers if you

741
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,710
successfully at least if this exploit a

742
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:04,250
successfully it's going to try to

743
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:06,680
exploit this vulnerability and the

744
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,800
device connects without due to

745
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,529
productivity

746
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:15,240
choose the session expired session

747
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:18,240
expired in this case no it doesn't go it

748
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,209
doesn't go back let's repeat it so i'm

749
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,930
going to use as those this as follows

750
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:30,480
let's use the little command connect as

751
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:35,009
as we see before this is not the right

752
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:38,130
one this we cannot launch it again let's

753
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:40,200
go let's go out here let's go outside

754
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:44,460
let's launch the attack again so next

755
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,529
time the victim connects again less rich

756
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,750
tablish the connection this is quite

757
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:50,850
sensitive as the fact of the

758
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,890
connectivity with is they building you

759
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:57,920
like to be here in this stadium is not

760
00:41:52,890 --> 00:42:00,629
very good so we type in control Z let's

761
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,840
load this little module again because

762
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:07,500
the one we want to explain telling him

763
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:12,480
what session is this and which I mean

764
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:15,840
connect with our IP our port again and

765
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,450
we let's try to exploit it if we are

766
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,940
lucky enough with the connectivity among

767
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:24,180
the different various devices over here

768
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:28,500
perfect we got it success let's pay

769
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:31,830
attention if I get a bell I am rude on

770
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:35,520
the device I have a complete control of

771
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:38,970
the device in order to use it as I want

772
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,540
to whatever in this best case scenario i

773
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:45,899
can install new applications without the

774
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,970
user noticing cuz we didn't see the

775
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,180
further i can transfer files and i

776
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:55,049
cannot obtain files from the device i'm

777
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:58,350
going to suppose i take this drops kate

778
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:01,740
and number and and i uploaded on the

779
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:03,670
device let's not waste time in the

780
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:08,020
transfer because is about 45

781
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:12,280
megas we got the ice has been and we do

782
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:16,660
is is big car in stormy seas droid scale

783
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:19,869
ap came installment is packaged with a

784
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:25,180
letter team the new application camps on

785
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:28,390
screamed once mr. user do not dunno does

786
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:31,990
not intervene at all I cannot even start

787
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:36,299
I i can install it I can do so and I can

788
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:42,040
remotely launched in installation and

789
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:44,200
launching remodeling here I can I have

790
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,799
to give an order them the application

791
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:50,759
droid scape if i type in incorrectly the

792
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:53,950
activity want to learn is droid escape

793
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:56,910
once launch the application is launched

794
00:43:53,950 --> 00:44:01,299
onto device here we go with applications

795
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:07,200
it measures and ways how much our finger

796
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:09,790
waves 0.0 50 grounds remotely I can i

797
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:14,529
install the application stop it in a

798
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:17,490
sock I can I am for stop and I can

799
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:21,250
indicate application to be a stop I said

800
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:24,759
his name multiplication we copy with

801
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:27,670
paste and with this way stop it it

802
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,099
stopped being executed in remote control

803
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:33,250
the user unless we launched something

804
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:36,430
visible this user would never know what

805
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:39,220
is happening I can do a p.m uninstalled

806
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:41,710
if I don't want to leave any tracks of

807
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:43,990
end of this application and I can

808
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:46,210
uninstall it and disappear from the

809
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:50,290
camera the icons image from the camera

810
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:53,109
it seems that never was there so far so

811
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:55,920
good and this year I have it I have a

812
00:44:53,109 --> 00:45:00,549
total control the device you sure can

813
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:04,359
still play around with the game the main

814
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:07,299
screen but in the background underlying

815
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:08,230
inter fact phase the attacker is doing

816
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:10,660
whatever

817
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:12,640
he likes so let's move on to the

818
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:16,210
conclusions we can draw from this

819
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:20,319
demonstration on screen to reflect now

820
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:24,160
over what's having conclusions one

821
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:27,220
option the ostrich the arch I didn't see

822
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,859
anything so I continue to use my model

823
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:34,180
phone life is wonderful it's beautiful

824
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm an ostrich but we should learn the

825
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:41,290
implications of the the good the bad and

826
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:45,040
the film movie like thing you have to be

827
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:48,250
aware that your mother phone your mother

828
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,390
phones smartphones tablets and the

829
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:55,510
doctors you you are yours these devices

830
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:57,930
are yourself I put my identity there oh

831
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:01,530
my digital life all my details later

832
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:05,440
locally and remotely are on this

833
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:07,630
identifiers on my devices you have to

834
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,310
coordinate these mechanisms without the

835
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:15,220
rigs I'm confronting we saw some

836
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:17,590
exfiltration of all digital confidential

837
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:20,529
information data what do you have on my

838
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:23,530
phone photographs emails all your

839
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:25,570
messages private confidential

840
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:30,420
information sensitive information I want

841
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:33,160
to protect my Jill location at ms s

842
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:36,810
called who are the ones I'm interacting

843
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:40,839
everything and there's a security issue

844
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:45,009
credential credentials Wi-Fi passwords

845
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:48,550
and remote services but not only those

846
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:52,840
local data but also accessible remotely

847
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:56,100
data because I can access my corporate

848
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:59,770
email drawbacks from my smartphone

849
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,770
remote services from which I can obtain

850
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:06,009
all the information once I got a client

851
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:08,740
with this axis which means it's not only

852
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:12,070
locally but also look remotely and this

853
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:15,220
is extended to statements of around

854
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:19,510
we're moving into the model world when

855
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:24,549
they want to encrypt do so data and they

856
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:27,310
ask you for ransom to wrap on how can I

857
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:30,550
be better protected recommendations

858
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:33,220
install mobile application apps from the

859
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:35,560
official markers which doesn't mean that

860
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,490
official markets are free of malware

861
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:43,420
mark efficient market half of course oh

862
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:47,109
wow ever that i can minimize the race by

863
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:51,390
not taking data from risky sources be

864
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:54,700
careful about the password on your

865
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:59,200
platform they have to be robust password

866
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:02,080
protecting my advice thirdly you not

867
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:06,339
carry out the jailbreak or root

868
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:08,259
processes because this weekend just

869
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,750
secure it in the devices I'm the

870
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:14,320
activated security mechanism I should

871
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:16,060
have the last release of my application

872
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,810
as the model phones of course this is a

873
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:22,750
big big challenge for all of us

874
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:27,070
regarding the smaller little younger

875
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:29,530
users how to do parenting compete I'm

876
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:32,800
not very clear these people have fear

877
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:36,550
fear in from less information than the

878
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:39,030
parts new generations use the smart

879
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:43,080
phones because they were born with them

880
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:45,400
so that they have a little awareness

881
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,740
criterium preoccupation about the de

882
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,770
Rick's so we need to educate our

883
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:52,118
children on that if you get a free

884
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,940
application if you are not paying for

885
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:57,640
that you are the product your

886
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,750
information your do localization your

887
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,810
images

888
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,520
people do not Belov free applications

889
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:05,080
because I don't have anything else to do

890
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,740
with our life there with the

891
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:10,980
reappearance we get a money from that so

892
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:14,620
at the corporate level there are ways to

893
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:18,220
manage adequately the mall homes in

894
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:20,830
order to have a control upon what

895
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,720
applications can be in store regarding

896
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:24,670
the security applications and how I have

897
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,560
to restrict and manage these

898
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:30,970
applications by the people in my

899
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:35,049
organization this is pretty much it so I

900
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:36,759
can open a round of questions should be

901
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:41,590
interested please raise your hands and

902
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:43,690
ask your questions freely thank you good

903
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:46,510
afternoon burn fiercely my

904
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:49,090
congratulations congrats man very

905
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:52,510
interesting I got a question because the

906
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:54,100
proof of concept we have conducted makes

907
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:58,450
me thing about the difference between

908
00:49:54,100 --> 00:50:00,490
working on local mode you have used

909
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:04,240
everything correctly connected on the

910
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:06,129
same network is different from working

911
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,939
with different networks the AAP ki can

912
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:12,850
be moved on to different devices on a

913
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:16,030
different network the result is the same

914
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:18,910
one part of the demo has been done with

915
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:22,710
will play which remotely installed

916
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:27,069
applications people connected through

917
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:30,540
tcp is the same being in a remote that

918
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:32,680
whereas local network people in with

919
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:35,320
installation on the model phone don't

920
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,810
wait for the attacker server connections

921
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,240
did wouldn't have word we have to fire

922
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:42,460
Forks and protection measures they do

923
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,620
just the other way around the one

924
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:47,400
connected on the attacker service to the

925
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,880
IEP whatever it is on the internet

926
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,340
establishes the channel of

927
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,160
communications and it starts receiving

928
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:55,630
the commands the present scenario here

929
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,870
are the properties even worse because

930
00:50:55,630 --> 00:51:01,660
there are so many people and Wi-Fi is

931
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:03,220
installed with God connectivity issues

932
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:09,370
because there is a lot of interference

933
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:10,279
in my set example network thank you

934
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:13,759
thank you very much

935
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:16,580
any more questions please raise your

936
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,160
hands I got a question over here not in

937
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:23,090
the front of the living my name is Juan

938
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:26,720
I want to ask you can we talk a

939
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:31,550
keylogger without the user knowing

940
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:34,759
instead of having a Nikon yes this would

941
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:37,760
have work when we got root privilege on

942
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:41,630
Android you have total control of device

943
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:44,350
in by including installing a software ET

944
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:48,230
la girl which captures all the

945
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:50,390
keystrokes on the screen in order to get

946
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:53,630
their passwords and whatever this is

947
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:57,470
skiing in with this level of access this

948
00:51:53,630 --> 00:52:00,680
is even worse because both on Android

949
00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:04,160
and on iOS you can install personalized

950
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:09,410
key keyboard which captures the keywords

951
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:11,480
and the keys as to measuring the weight

952
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:14,029
of my figure I could have been stolen

953
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:18,110
personalized customized giver and I

954
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:20,750
could have activated by default another

955
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:22,940
questions or regarding the this

956
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:25,070
certification you have created this

957
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:28,190
application can be uploaded signed by

958
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:30,170
Microsoft imply the Play Store yes

959
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:32,000
except this kind of applications can be

960
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:34,580
uploaded wherever you want the worse the

961
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,670
problem on Android certificates from

962
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:39,500
developers are self fine they do not

963
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:41,780
need to come from the certifying

964
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,550
authorities officially you can do so if

965
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,010
you satisfy the one of the bigger such

966
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:48,440
as Microsoft what's going to happen when

967
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:50,840
Google is doing a process of

968
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,910
verification by uploading the

969
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,090
application you do not tell you okay you

970
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:59,990
are not Microsoft but let's takes

971
00:52:55,090 --> 00:53:01,940
another less normal company this is not

972
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:05,890
going to know that if you are not the

973
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,890
person the more questions please

974
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:15,279
you had been talking about the projects

975
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:17,170
to avoid malware antiviruses are one

976
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,100
examples please can you please repeat

977
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:25,570
the question but worth it you talk about

978
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:27,700
vs do by installing please don't call me

979
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:30,550
sir you are still I'm still a young

980
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:33,640
girls don't call me sir anti viruses on

981
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:35,980
mobile environments are not the way they

982
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,690
look like they are not equivalent to the

983
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:40,600
anti viruses in the traditional way

984
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:42,880
because in the mobile world applications

985
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,490
run through on restrictive environments

986
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,290
and the antivirus is one more

987
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:49,540
application integrated by the

988
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,910

applications but this is happening I

1017
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:18,300
know a case of a Spain's Bank wearing an

1018
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,190
app marketing application somebody has

1019
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,140
published an application in their name

1020
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,660
and they are gonna having traveled to

1021
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:27,089
read to removing because the other one

1022
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:29,160
publishing is the other and they are the

1023
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,750
owners of this application in this banks

1024
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,120
and they cannot substitute the

1025
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,860
legitimate with the legitimate one so

1026
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,859
they are they're having a pin the net

1027
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:40,050
people found frames to pretend being

1028
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:41,790
yourself because the circuitry has the

1029
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:44,310
