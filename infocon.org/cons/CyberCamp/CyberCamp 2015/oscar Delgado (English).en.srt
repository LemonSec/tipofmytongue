1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,770
go get us some stuff it's out of this

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,709
one of the other Duluth good morning

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,960
everybody thanks for coming because on

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,730
the saturday at ten a.m. you have to be

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,730
very eager here we're going to talk

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,710
about the blockchain it is related to

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,840
big coin but as you know is not exactly

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:29,099
the same how many of you know what the

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:36,660
block chain of bitcoin is this is going

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:40,469
to be a very straightforward talk but

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,510
those of you who know about this would

12
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:46,190
what do you what have you heard about

13
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,510
this a blockchain probably needs a

14
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,610
disruptive technology that will change

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:56,420
the world and solve the problem of

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:01,649
hunger in Africa yes this is just the

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:04,470
eel slide of the cover of The Economist

18
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,920
which is not exactly a very progressive

19
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:11,100
or disruptive a journal and it says that

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,920
it the technology behind bitcoin could

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,009
transform how the economy works at this

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,750
channel report by the vvd a saying that

23
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,580
the blockchain technology is the

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,610
guesstimate disruption in the financial

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,259
system this is what the banks are saying

26
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:29,670
so you have to be aware of how much

27
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:31,829
impact it has for the back to be saying

28
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,180
that in another recent news item from

29
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:41,758
the banks and under who says these would

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,950
that 20 billion could be the savings

31
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,430
that the banking sector could make I

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:51,450
using this technology here in in Spain

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:56,969
Bank inter he invested going fade

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:59,610
the vba also bet on the bitcoin and so

35
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:03,750
as you can see there is the huge

36
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,390
interest in this technology and it has a

37
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,799
huge potential we'll talk about it but

38
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,929
let's start from the beginning we have

39
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,690
said that the blockchain is Bay is

40
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,209
related to Bitcoin I'm sure you've all

41
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,150
heard about how this started in 2009

42
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,830
Tadashi Nakamoto somebody in two

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,769
thousand of course that's not his name

44
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:27,380
but somebody publishes an article a

45
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:30,540
paper he knew in the forum that's not

46
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:34,200
very much notice saying that he had

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:38,069
solved the problem that was a open in

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,589
the cryptographic society in since the

49
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:44,190
80s a digital money this is the paper he

50
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,569
published in the academic world they

51
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,910
were not very much headed but later on

52
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:55,170
peoples are realizing you know that

53
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:58,500
bitcoin is a digital coin or a digital

54
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:04,048
currency currency a protocol it is an

55
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:09,750
anonymous system it's not traceable in

56
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:12,049
principle transfers are very very fast

57
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:17,220
compared to the traditional system and

58
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:20,790
it has so far very very low commissions

59
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:23,730
it was it started in 2009 but the key

60
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,510
word in this slide is decentralized this

61
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:30,709
is the first digital money system that

62
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:35,269
really solves the problem Bitcoin us and

63
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:39,120
Orin ha take the origin it had you all

64
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:43,130
know what she broke the Silk Road is

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:48,410
about this is a market

66
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:51,710
hey this is a real a slide or snapshot

67
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:54,710
of when it was open everybody knew it

68
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,510
was there and this this was nothing in

69
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,930
this slide is legal and this is how it

70
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:03,260
ended but bitcoin is being used now for

71
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:09,410
for legal stuff you can buy pretty much

72
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:12,079
everything here in Madrid it's been for

73
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:15,140
a while accepted in the serrano street

74
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,970
this is the famous cash point in the

75
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:22,640
serrano street have you have it use it

76
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:25,040
whenever i come by it's not working it's

77
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,260
out of order but this is the origin but

78
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,750
I came here to talk about my book so

79
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:38,030
they block chain which is basically just

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:41,420
what a bit of the Bitcoin system if

81
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:44,630
bitcoin is a car they the block chain is

82
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:50,810
just the engine we could say that

83
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:55,570
bitcoin is a protocol with it has the

84
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,570
addresses the identifiers for users the

85
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,500
p.o and w which is what proves that

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:07,010
we've used computational capacity and

87
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,780
then it has the blockchain the block

88
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,570
chain is actually very simple it's

89
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,299
nothing but a register of distributed a

90
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,729
distributed register of data

91
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,530
it is distributed throughout the world

92
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:23,750
it runs in all of the noda of the

93
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,789
network and it cannot be changed

94
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,039
anything thats registered cannot be

95
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:31,068
changed in principle and we'll see what

96
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,830
problems that entail so the blockchain

97
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:37,340
is just one part of the bitcoins

98
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,590
instantly but why is that different if

99
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,500
the problem has has been around for so

100
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,229
long well the fact that there is no

101
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:49,009
central authority in principle is an

102
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:51,979
advantage because it means there is no

103
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:56,150
not a single failure point that there is

104
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:59,930
no corruption Bitcoin were generated to

105
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:02,929
remove or the financial system or at

106
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,539
least to set up a parallel one so that's

107
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,729
why it's all the more striking that bugs

108
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:13,099
are excited about it and you cannot in

109
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:16,690
principle Balan or only to the extent

110
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:19,069
that you can burn a distributed p2p

111
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,130
Network but what's interesting is that

112
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:24,650
the bitcoin is the first algorithm of

113
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,900
distributed consensus it solves the

114
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,698
problem of the by the recent high

115
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,580
generals which is basically about how

116
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,529
can we on keep on computing and

117
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,289
processing data in an environment in

118
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:39,770
which we know that a high percentage of

119
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:44,990
the Nordic an fast classified

120
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:50,299
information or resend it or send it a

121
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:54,620
sort of changing it so the generals can

122
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,389
actually use the optical strategy is to

123
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,550
disrupt it and yet it keeps on working

124
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:00,710
so it's the first algorithm of

125
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:03,889
distributed consensus with anonymous

126
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,560
participants and with a considerable

127
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:08,509
number of odd hackers that guy

128
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,370
nevertheless keep on working properly

129
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:15,319
we're going to look at the mathematics

130
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:17,029
of these of how the network works no no

131
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,249
I'm joking I'm not going to go into the

132
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:22,229
mass

133
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:24,639
so what does it look like you cannot

134
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:31,229
have a picture of that but I like this

135
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:34,179
representation just to take a look at it

136
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:37,419
but if you look at the relationships

137
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:40,659
between the blogs etc this is a graphic

138
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:42,639
idea of what it could look like going to

139
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:46,709
talk first of all about the possible

140
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:51,339
users because this technology is proven

141
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:53,709
or is being so demanding and and why is

142
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:56,939
it it did amount is so high and then we

143
00:07:53,709 --> 00:08:01,779
will talk about the problems in entails

144
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:05,229
so the vulnerabilities and the drawbacks

145
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:08,709
because I teach at the University I have

146
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:12,269
nothing to sell so the third part of the

147
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:16,929
talk is what's usually not discussed and

148
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:19,029
what can we use it for I'm going to tell

149
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:21,399
you about three which I think are the

150
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:25,769
most interesting ones but there are

151
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:29,729
really really hundreds of possible uses

152
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:34,209
the uses that I brought here are with

153
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:36,519
what I've called digital not re all the

154
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:39,039
financial sector applications and the

155
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:42,610
high connection with the Internet of

156
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,870
Things what is the notary a digital

157
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,540
lottery well we've said that is this is

158
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:53,589
distributed a data register imagine that

159
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:56,199
we keep in this register Bitcoin uses

160
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:59,709
the blockchain to keep a register of the

161
00:08:56,199 --> 00:09:04,240
transactions that have I occurred and it

162
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:06,219
stores all the transactions from 2009

163
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,959
from the very very first one that i

164
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,949
cannot i did at a time until the one

165
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,949
that's being done right now

166
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,949
so the memory use this fork key gasps

167
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:23,319
and it is still going up but nothing

168
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:29,769
forces us to to store those inputs or

169
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:33,009
outputs we can store anything else if we

170
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:36,129
put a mortgage there then then it

171
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:38,230
becomes like a digital lottery imagine

172
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:42,579
the advantages how much we're going to

173
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:47,680
save there's no not read that is going

174
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:50,790
to charge you 300 years just for going

175
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:56,500
through the door of their office so

176
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:59,370
because anybody a good verify things at

177
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:03,910
any point in time there's no corruption

178
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:07,120
possibility because a with an artery

179
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,639
system we are we decide to trudge them

180
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:15,250
but they are on as corruptible as

181
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:16,899
anybody else so so we see that in it has

182
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,189
a lot of advantages but there are

183
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:23,410
problems no doubt and here I are still

184
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:26,860
making friends because they digitally

185
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:29,920
the digital notaries systems as they are

186
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,100
set up right now do not work they are

187
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,279
not safe you're not a cure but this

188
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:41,759
system it would provide integrity here

189
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,759
to the system and in sort of guarantee

190
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:49,990
the hilarity of the document or but

191
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,529
that's not true temporary privileges

192
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,420
them what they save is a hash of the

193
00:10:53,529 --> 00:11:00,430
document you know what a hash function

194
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:03,520
is they keep a hash of the document and

195
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:07,270
that only ensures

196
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,350
integrity not authentication anybody can

197
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:13,510
regenerate it imagine the situation I

198
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,630
discover the formula of a new wonderful

199
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:20,580
love soft drink and I store it in the

200
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:23,110
blockchain using that this system and

201
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:28,630
somebody steals the documented I lose my

202
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:30,880
computer or somebody generates a Trojan

203
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,740
just to get that document there are

204
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,430
three million possibilities or ways in

205
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,710
which you can steal the document from me

206
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:41,260
two months later that gentleman begins

207
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,800
to produce hit a soft drink with my

208
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,510
formula and I have to document it but I

209
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,900
had the document in the blockchain and

210
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:51,460
and you have to well tell the chart and

211
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,160
well explain to the judge what the

212
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:58,980
blockchain is and and I've had to

213
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:03,400
explain to a judge with an IP address is

214
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,080
well if you're able to to go beyond all

215
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,020
that and we can really explain that the

216
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,900
block chain is safe secure and that's

217
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:14,069
been done in this date so the judge says

218
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:18,340
okay you say this is your document and

219
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:24,100
he calculates the hash function and he

220
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:26,620
gets an effort but the steeler can

221
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:31,780
provide the same document with the same

222
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:33,970
hash a bigger and they are both the same

223
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:37,620
so the judge cannot distinguish between

224
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:41,880
who is the real owner so you can not a

225
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,440
guarantee ownership of the document you

226
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,870
guarantee you can guarantee that the

227
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,640
document existed at a point in time but

228
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,120
that doesn't mean that's nothing to do

229
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,569
with ownership these systems are also

230
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,890
open anybody can send a document sort of

231
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,890
pretending to be somebody else

232
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:11,900
if the system where to have real sort of

233
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:13,430
legal illegally valid you would have the

234
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,699
problem of who's and it we could we

235
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,680
could do it by using digital signatures

236
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,570
but there is a problem because the way

237
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,989
the block chain works in normal

238
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,510
transactions you can only have a 40

239
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,550
bytes and that is the problems you will

240
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,700
have to put several together so you have

241
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:35,300
to the way so the way it stands right

242
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:38,210
now it can only ensure integrity but no

243
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,699
no from ownership I hope there's nobody

244
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:47,780
from Stampley here but anyway they're

245
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:52,600
angry and we already I'll derived muses

246
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:56,449
well imagine crowdfunding campaigns for

247
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:00,560
projects is smart contracts the

248
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:02,840
blockchain can also store small scripts

249
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,050
they do not have the capacity of other

250
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,270
networks but and we will see a clear

251
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,790
example of this and you'll understand

252
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:14,270
that later on better so we could say

253
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:17,780
that only in certain circumstances that

254
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:20,480
a contract is enforced for instance in

255
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,699
the case of an inheritance in a next

256
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,820
example another example certification of

257
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,340
the information in production change and

258
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,130
distribution change you want to certify

259
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:34,250
any all of the steps of a production

260
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:37,970
change so that the producer can keep

261
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:41,140
evidence that the furnish that the

262
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:45,320
grapes are the right ones so that the

263
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:47,630
consumers with a QR code can check that

264
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,130
there's been no tampering with those

265
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,640
steps it's another thing that the

266
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:55,430
producer lies at the origin or the

267
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,290
source but you can guarantee that

268
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,459
nothing has been tampered with once

269
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,670
they've been introduced in the

270
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,950
blockchain there's another concept that

271
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:08,540
I really like which is the digital

272
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:13,580
democracy hey 2.0 imagine we

273
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:16,699
he asked parties to keep their programs

274
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,400
since they say they are contract in the

275
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,830
block chain that but this is like

276
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,230
imagine really we need your corner here

277
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,320
to advocate this because I cannot really

278
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:30,650
believe it see it happening imagine sort

279
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,020
of vote systems that are cannot be

280
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,000
tampered with you could set up them very

281
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,220
quickly something that could not be

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,680
tampered with not even by the government

283
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,540
I'm making a quick sort of overview and

284
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,729
so we will have time for questions on

285
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,589
what really interests is you later on

286
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,630
there are other possible youths that is

287
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,610
particularly interesting for me is the

288
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,700
internally of things and I like it

289
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,470
because in the blockchain nobody knows

290
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:06,020
your fridge and that's important because

291
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:07,370
the blockchain allowed I those smart

292
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,319
contracts that I was talking about

293
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,810
earlier on you can take that to a

294
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,160
different level imagine a car or a house

295
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:18,589
a car that has a Wi-Fi connection a

296
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,040
capacity or can check with the block

297
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:24,920
chain system so we could have a purchase

298
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,490
and sale system I make a transaction I

299
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:32,569
pay some money for the for the rental of

300
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:36,260
the car and the Cardinals that has been

301
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,660
rendered and relates that and changes

302
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:42,280
the properties of the log to allow the

303
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,280
person who's made a payment

304
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:50,689
and allows the owner of that key to to

305
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,720
access the car for a week and then he

306
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:56,510
sort of refuses to the permission and

307
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,920
and we can talk about rentals we can

308
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,660
talk about purchasing cetera another

309
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,209
thing is that it allows for is

310
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,760
micropayment between devices because

311
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:11,959
it's not easy for a machine to pay are

312
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,230
not to another machine for amounts that

313
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,000
are below one euro set it's difficult to

314
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:21,349
pay that amount right now and there are

315
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,640
already services for paper use for

316
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:29,350
instance to recharge your mobile phone

317
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:33,800
there are many services that would

318
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:38,449
benefit from this and the third big use

319
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:41,270
is that of the financial sector this is

320
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,420
the cover the front page of the SAT

321
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,550
under report whose conclusions were I

322
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:51,470
mentioned earlier on the 20 billion

323
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:54,409
savings and look at the title reboot in

324
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,510
financial services that's quite striking

325
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:59,030
and there is a sentence that I heard

326
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:04,040
from a summary in the banking sector in

327
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:08,030
Spain I found it very striking he said

328
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,370
if we had had this technology some a

329
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:13,129
while ago we wouldn't have suffered the

330
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,919
crisis that we've had I don't know if he

331
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:19,340
was exaggerated but he was saying that

332
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,900
the crisis was a problem of her trust

333
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,360
between banks because they've been

334
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:26,510
cheating on each other so this system

335
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,669
allows to bring to give transparency to

336
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,780
the system in a way that but that's

337
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,780
completely unforeseen

338
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,710
so what happens if you are planning to

339
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,850
do with this well they are bit lost

340
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:45,640
right now they are still beginning to

341
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:48,540
feel the way but there are huge

342
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,640
opportunities there we could think about

343
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:55,000
replacing and this is and science

344
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,780
fiction right now but the Swift network

345
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,210
for that is used by banks to pay each

346
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,520
other internationally with a Bitcoin

347
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,310
system you all have done an

348
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,350
international transfer it takes a few

349
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,570
days and it's quite expensive and the

350
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,870
banks are interested in reducing that

351
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:17,830
because it's also a manual process for

352
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:20,649
them to avoid mistakes and and with this

353
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:26,679
system we could have put any amount of

354
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:29,310
money anywhere in 10 minutes because as

355
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,800
you know 10 minutes at the time that the

356
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:35,020
transactions in Bitcoin take to

357
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:39,250
consolidate so this is imprintable

358
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:42,580
possible what are the problems with the

359
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:45,310
current block chain with the bandwidth

360
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:48,310
band block change when not was not

361
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:51,550
designed for high demand that high this

362
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:54,070
probability or right now the block trade

363
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:57,220
can process from seven transactions per

364
00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:00,669
second and that's incredibly small

365
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:05,950
because in these systems or can process

366
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:09,370
a 45,000 around 14,000 transactions per

367
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:12,810
second another problem for the banks is

368
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,810
that there are no

369
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,570
permits for reading and writing and

370
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:21,600
writing and there's no identity and

371
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:24,689
that's why bitcoin wasn't how it was

372
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,990
designed but we're trying to take the

373
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,549
block chain from bitcoin and see what it

374
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,549
could be used for and for some things

375
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:36,870
it's very appropriate but not so much

376
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:39,720
for some others there is the 51-percent

377
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,279
attack and right now we are at the 25

378
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,179
percent level and that means that

379
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:47,520
whoever controls more than 51 percent or

380
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:49,980
twenty-five percent of the computational

381
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:55,139
capacity of the web kind of a network

382
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:59,070
can in fortified theme is what's going

383
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:02,700
on so the security disappears privacy of

384
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:07,879
information the banks don't want all

385
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:11,070
their information to be public and

386
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,529
something else is that the development

387
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,789
is the unpredictable and free and

388
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:21,140
there's also a the reputational issue

389
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:25,230
it's impossible for a bank to to do

390
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:28,380
transactions next to somebody else who's

391
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:32,309
buying their weapons illegally so I

392
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:35,940
think the bangs are going to move

393
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:40,559
towards an empire the blockchain is

394
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:43,679
public but we can imagine it in an

395
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,710
intermediate system we could have public

396
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,020
semi public or private chains a reading

397
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,960
with a reading airplane with the reading

398
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:55,260
and writing permissions this is the

399
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,360
Bitcoin option it's public everybody can

400
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,549
read everybody can write it uses

401
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,129
everything I've said already that you do

402
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:05,070
not really internet of things etc but we

403
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:07,440
could have hybrid systems a change in

404
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,210
which they're reading information is

405
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,000
public everybody can read but not

406
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,750
everybody can write or not everybody can

407
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,630
write but it

408
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,330
but this would be different parts for

409
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:23,560
different possible uses for instance

410
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:26,439
these would allow to have the audit by

411
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,230
central authority not everybody that the

412
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,980
central bank could say I want access to

413
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:36,550
all of your account and only a central

414
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:38,920
bank could do the audit with knowing

415
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:41,940
that it hasn't been tampered with of

416
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,560
course if the banks introduce the

417
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,340
information that's false to begin with

418
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:52,960
then that we cannot solve the North

419
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:54,760
American Nasdaq has a pilot and trying

420
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,070
to apply this technology because if you

421
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,590
can think about it for a stock market

422
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:03,610
it's very useful you know what

423
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:06,939
frustrating is well these democratizes

424
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:11,229
if we sell and buy shares with this type

425
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:13,540
of system you democratize access there's

426
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,090
no advantage to be in some of the

427
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:22,750
hundred meters away from Wall Street you

428
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:25,090
also have to invade reinvent the

429
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,460
blockchain to allow for this for this

430
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,860
type of use but the ideal and the idea

431
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:33,780
is potentially huge are we doing with

432
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,780
time I forgot to check my watch

433
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,340
any questions so far because I really

434
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:48,129
would like this session to be what what

435
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:50,559
do you think about this ok ok let's talk

436
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:52,389
about what's not usually discussed the

437
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,450
vulnerabilities what are the problems of

438
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:58,918
the current block chain in Bitcoin I've

439
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,919
selected a bunch

440
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:08,490
software packs which exists and will

441
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:14,050
keep on existing a scalability the

442
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:17,490
51-percent attack the selfish mining and

443
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:21,100
identity let's look at them in detail

444
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:23,980
software bugs in general the code you

445
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,439
know the chateau she a few days after

446
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,260
published in the paper also published is

447
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:33,700
a client software which is surprisingly

448
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:37,600
well region in general the Bitcoin

449
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,490
software is okay but that the happy

450
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,990
problems for instance this vulnerability

451
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:48,700
in tune 2010 which has been the most

452
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:50,770
dangerous one that allows you to to

453
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,590
spend somebody else's money it wasn't

454
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:57,610
exploited but it could have made the

455
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:04,419
system crash in archives 2010 in block

456
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:07,770
to 7463 aid there is a return and output

457
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:17,070
or not going transaction of a hammer and

458
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:22,780
an 84 millions or in it was quickly

459
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:26,770
solved with with a patch and a manual

460
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,750
fork and they did see that there was a

461
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:31,690
double of expenditure of ten thousand

462
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:33,670
dollars in march two thousand thirteen

463
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,710
and it was suffered I'm suffered this

464
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:37,540
one and perhaps some of you there was a

465
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:41,740
mistake in the update he didn't remember

466
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:46,440
this did they affect you the updating of

467
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,440
the main client there was a problem

468
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:55,899
and they had to do a fork for about six

469
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:59,320
hours and everybody was asked to go back

470
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:02,650
to an earlier version of the client so

471
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:09,159
the main developers are very careful in

472
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:12,340
the in the a blatant but these are

473
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:15,370
inevitable of events I believe that

474
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:20,409
there are no huge failures in the system

475
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:24,310
because the whole of the Bitcoin could

476
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:26,770
allow you to the whole system to crash

477
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:30,340
if there's a buffer own that can do away

478
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:32,530
with everything but the best inceptive

479
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,939
is the economic incentive and the

480
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:35,620
developers themselves had said that

481
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,780
there is a lot of they've been a lot of

482
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:41,709
people auditing the bead cone code and

483
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,350
with the interest with the economic

484
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,960
interest of a improving incentives and

485
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,300
of course and so I think there are no

486
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,750
big failures although there might be

487
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:55,030
problems of denial of service etc

488
00:26:51,750 --> 00:27:00,490
another vulnerabilities that of

489
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:05,350
scalability Bitcoin has been designed to

490
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:12,900
generate a new block 10 every 10 minutes

491
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:15,520
and the size is one mega so you can do

492
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:20,370
seven transactions per second whereas

493
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:23,040
visa can process 56,000 and that

494
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:26,409
particularly if you think that the

495
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:30,730
thousands or millions of devices should

496
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:32,440
connect to the system and start

497
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,880
transactions a

498
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,490
simultaneously but there are ID has to

499
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:46,429
improve that 51-percent of dark implies

500
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:49,340
that if there is a percentage of the web

501
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:55,340
that controls 50 more than fifty one

502
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:58,730
percent can force a pork and manipulate

503
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:01,549
this saved the security of this block

504
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:07,100
chain in this worship this almost

505
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:12,980
happened in tonight in jun 2014 you know

506
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:17,389
they get together in the miners working

507
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:21,500
pools and june last year and one of

508
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:26,418
those pulses spontaneously got

509
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:30,590
dangerously close to two going over 51%

510
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:33,350
a and they asked their own users to to

511
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:39,010
move to other pools but until nothing

512
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:41,240
happened but this was about to happen

513
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,059
sort of spontaneously without anybody

514
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,059
planning so no better evidence that it

515
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:49,789
can really happen so i asked myself if

516
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:54,879
you look at this distribution weather

517
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:54,879
bitcoin is really distributed still

518
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,039
we have said bitcoin is a crypto

519
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:05,380
currency a distributed cryptocurrency

520
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:09,440
without a central authority but it seems

521
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:11,690
you could say also that it's a crypto

522
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,780
currency controlled by a few entities

523
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:17,150
which is which other pools so there are

524
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:23,510
10 12 and it is that are actually

525
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:28,429
controlling the proof what are the

526
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:32,240
drawbacks well the stratum protocol

527
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:38,679
which is the main one years by poles to

528
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,679
distribute the block between users

529
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:48,049
prevent the control of the blocks by the

530
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:50,900
miners you cannot choose which one you

531
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:52,610
want to mine and ninety-nine percent of

532
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,610
the usage don't mind they only want to

533
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:58,520
have the greatest economic profit but

534
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:03,559
you lose control you are handing over

535
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:07,570
control to the other to the pool owners

536
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:09,830
and it has consequences on research

537
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,379
because when you want to fiddle with the

538
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,570
system and you want to test new attacks

539
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,700
you cannot do it because when you send

540
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:19,668
the blocks to be processed by the net

541
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,559
for you they are not process the way you

542
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:23,690
want them because the pools have their

543
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,210
own rules so when you want to generate

544
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,460
an attack the attack

545
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,560
it's not successful because it's not

546
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,040
processing the way you expected into and

547
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:39,470
they follow with the next attack is that

548
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:42,710
of the selfish mining the one that makes

549
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:45,470
that the 51 / centre-back becomes the

550
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:48,380
25-percent attack these attack presented

551
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,570
in 2013 I think it was on the corner

552
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:54,710
table and they use the following ad and

553
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:56,330
it's very simple when you mine in the

554
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:01,720
block and you find the solution to not

555
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:04,520
publish it and and we will see now how

556
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:08,150
India you with just twenty-five percent

557
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:10,550
of the hash rate you get a lot more a

558
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:13,030
reward than you would deserve without

559
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:19,340
twenty one percent this is how it works

560
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:21,470
imagine these are they good guys and the

561
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:25,070
bad guys there are a bunch of us heat

562
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:28,400
down here good ones are mining their

563
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:32,000
blogs and we all of a sudden the

564
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:36,770
attackers find a block they buy the

565
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,100
solution these alpha and 1 minus alpha

566
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,720
it's a proportional computational hey

567
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,070
capacity that they have compared to the

568
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,200
whole network which of course at the

569
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:49,750
beginning it will be small because there

570
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:53,090
are a lot more honest notes initially so

571
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:57,830
the scenario is we find that block and

572
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:59,959
we do not publish it so we keep quiet

573
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,820
and from then on several things can

574
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,180
happen in the more likely one is that

575
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:07,280
seems most the honest nodes have more

576
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:11,150
computational capacity they will find

577
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,070
other correct block blocks blocks so

578
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,200
this is what happens they find another

579
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:17,060
block and the attackers have to publish

580
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,320
immediately the one the block that they

581
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:23,780
had keep quiet about and I will provoke

582
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,530
a fork and that means that the Bitcoin

583
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:30,100
protocol says that when two notes a

584
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:33,428
Polish two solutions

585
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:35,320
simultaneously in time so you did you

586
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:37,919
that produces a fork and you keep on

587
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,750
working on both branches so we're here

588
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:44,950
other things could happen it could

589
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:50,850
happen that the the good guys find the

590
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,850
next block so the attackers make nothing

591
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:02,760
and but it may also happens that from

592
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:05,840
this situation onward or after the

593
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,879
situation the bad guys find the next

594
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:13,500
block and in this case the good and the

595
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,620
bad guys would save the the profits but

596
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:21,480
it could be the bad guys who find the

597
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:25,020
the new block and then they would

598
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,200
receive more than they deserve in the

599
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:30,750
original block that that's been found by

600
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,640
the good guys it's lost and all the

601
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:36,900
computational effort that was devoted to

602
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,330
that is also lost so the attack means I

603
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:42,420
have at least that the network will be a

604
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:46,169
lot slower because many of them because

605
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,270
a great percentage of the honest or the

606
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,350
good guys are working on something

607
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:54,540
that's going to be completely used

608
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:57,090
useless and this during this period the

609
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,590
system would make it a lot it would be a

610
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:03,030
lot more vulnerable to double

611
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:05,480
expenditure and Eve trans should if it

612
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,480
is too

613
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:17,879
proves to be more effective if working

614
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:23,190
in this way is financially more

615
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:28,000
profitable that being honest and most

616
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:33,399
99% of miners their priority is making

617
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,799
money then they could switch to this way

618
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:39,279
of working and if high percentage of

619
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:42,549
miners they did it that way they would

620
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,329
immediately have control of the network

621
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:47,559
and they would have that control forever

622
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:50,859
because they will always be ahead of the

623
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:55,629
honest my nurses so they would become

624
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:57,069
the owners of the system and then unless

625
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:59,290
they went below that twenty-five percent

626
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:00,730
they will never lose that power they

627
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,380
could do whatever they wanted with the

628
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:07,290
system they could make false

629
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,290
transactions and that's a big problem

630
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:17,509
damascus awesome poor else this is other

631
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:20,840
problem as I see it the reddest problem

632
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:23,270
when we talk about blockchain for

633
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:26,270
example you get this question can we set

634
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:28,040
up the Airbnb uber services that are

635
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:30,470
fairly distributed as the same example

636
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,180
of the car that I gave you before well

637
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:36,799
would you rent an apartment on Airbnb

638
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,359
without knowing who that person is where

639
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,820
you don't get any information you only

640
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,490
have a phone number no person identified

641
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:47,870
that's unthinkable in order for the

642
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:49,970
blockchain to be to start being used as

643
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:52,819
a distributed service we need to sort

644
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,470
out this problem with identity difficult

645
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,680
cryptographic problem and it still needs

646
00:35:54,470 --> 00:36:02,270
to be sorted out so as I see these would

647
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:07,460
be the fifth greatest peeler and that

648
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:10,450
would be all I would like to have your

649
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,450
questions later thank you very much

650
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,350
makeup

651
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:22,000
get out what what's the time haha

652
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,580
over there I think

653
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,960
morning how is it how are you doing kid

654
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,710
I've moved you mention it before because

655
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:43,470
I came in a bit late but what if the

656
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:46,320
Bitcoin limit is that is my novel is

657
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:49,290
rage what what if especially if I

658
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,850
naturally speak and can we think of it

659
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:54,300
as an alternative to the existing

660
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:56,880
financial system you might not know but

661
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,000
the number of it gains is limited the

662
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,390
system is defined for 21 million coins

663
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,880
and that's it it is estimated that half

664
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:12,660
of them have in mind already and it's

665
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:14,970
estimated that by 2040 2140 the last one

666
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,129
will be found actually it will be much

667
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:20,189
more expensive to remind them it will

668
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,840
cause much more money to find them than

669
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,430
the reward that you can get out of them

670
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,640
actually when you find one of these

671
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:29,819
solutions 25 bitcoins are given in

672
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:34,279
reward and this is ben haft and half so

673
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:37,470
it's less and less profitable to mine

674
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:40,320
well in a natural it's designed not to

675
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:42,810
be fractional that was the rule the

676
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,940
standard so initially nothing would

677
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:48,120
happen we would read some kind of break

678
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:52,260
even point and it would be based on

679
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:54,569
offer and demand and supply that the

680
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,910
inherent to the system that's how it

681
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:58,070
would work no problem there because the

682
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:02,600
minimum

683
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:06,080
unit is chatter see that it's ten up to

684
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,790
the minus 18 power we could narrow it

685
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,460
down so much that there will be no

686
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,440
problem their current problem now with

687
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,970
Bitcoin maybe you don't know about it

688
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,740
but it would be volatile atif first it's

689
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:22,580
above a thousand dollars well actually

690
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:25,520
now it's 200 something euros a couple of

691
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:28,690
weeks back it was about 400 so you see

692
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,490
there's this volatility ups and downs

693
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:34,970
since there is no direct relationship

694
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:38,209
there is no back up for the deep

695
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:41,169
reliable coin and veneer I think there

696
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:41,170
was another question out there

697
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:48,869
good morning congrats on your

698
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,970
presentation very interesting what about

699
00:38:48,869 --> 00:38:54,180
the 25-percent attack I didn't really

700
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:58,169
understand so if a minor is not

701
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:00,868
publishing the validated node why the

702
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:05,010
correspondence goes up compared to the

703
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:08,820
honest minor well here no reward yet but

704
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:13,100
this is here when it all starts maths

705
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:15,930
are complicated it is long-term win when

706
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,720
he makes most of the man is here with

707
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:21,629
the second block when it's found then he

708
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:25,220
posts or they post both they published

709
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:29,970
both and get the fears from both lux

710
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:31,830
both yes but if the owners minor were to

711
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:34,950
validate both and he would also get the

712
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:37,770
reward right yes here only he's rue

713
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:41,399
there's um this is a branch to be

714
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:44,280
followed this one and the attacker would

715
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,770
get the face for this block and the

716
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,830
whole network would get the face for

717
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,150
this second block I didn't bring the

718
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,759
maps with me because a bit complicated

719
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:56,130
but we need a long-term study of the

720
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,770
system by checking out age of the

721
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,869
scenarios individually well there's no

722
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,150
win you need to mathematically prove

723
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:05,609
that it's an optimal super optimal

724
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:09,119
strategy above bitcoins and it's part of

725
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:11,009
the article details a bit nitty-gritty

726
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,380
but I can give you the reference of very

727
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,990
interested and there you see where

728
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,580
you've it's been proven that only with

729
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:21,660
25 person you're making more money than

730
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:23,910
it would actually you would actually get

731
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,279
with that exact percentage is not just

732
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:27,810
about the network but actually more than

733
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,280
you should be entitled to with just

734
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:31,619
twenty-five percent and on top of that

735
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,720
you have the chance of cooking

736
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:36,000
transactions matter handling transaction

737
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,819
that's the main advantage you would be

738
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,680
kind of a bait attracting people if you

739
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,690
mind it like this you will make more

740
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,460
money people would assert mine in life

741
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,230
this actually

742
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,420
some miners might be doing so this

743
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:51,190
attack was published in 2013 and we

744
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,320
don't know someone's doing so it might

745
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:56,110
be the case I don't think so because

746
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:59,290
there would be no folks much more often

747
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:03,520
if these words the case but the minute

748
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:07,920
we have minors making enough compared to

749
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:11,050
the network percentage that would be a

750
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,870
problem what concerns me the most is

751
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:15,490
that this becomes permanent if twenty

752
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,290
five percent of the net result smiling

753
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,540
like this these advantage of two blogs

754
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,100
would be patent and they would always be

755
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,840
ahead of everyone else because the

756
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,120
minute the net refines one they would

757
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,910
publish the previous one it could be

758
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,950
kind of a raise I find to block so I'm

759
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:34,750
two blocks ahead of you you find one

760
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:36,520
okay so I publish one and I got but I'm

761
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,460
ahead of you once again so you will

762
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,520
never catch up with me that's why it's

763
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:45,880
so dangerous at this other question of

764
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,400
taking the kind of volatility currency

765
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:53,200
prices going up and down would you favor

766
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,390
the coin I don't know honestly I don't

767
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,879
know I do have bitcoins for all many of

768
00:41:55,390 --> 00:42:00,770
you as well

769
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:05,000
difficulty saying it's hard to say

770
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:07,460
because bitcoins blockchain I don't

771
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,220
think it'll be used that much all the

772
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:13,490
applications i mentioned probably will

773
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:16,100
be finally implemented with ripple or

774
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,629
its idiom which are other systems you

775
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,680
are familiar with them against it if

776
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:24,170
limousine basically will explain this is

777
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,500
a distributed data record that we have

778
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:31,280
so if the block chain records data item

779
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:33,410
records program so chunks of code that

780
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,890
will be distributed from computing and

781
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:39,529
it's incomplete Turin actually and so

782
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:42,109
you can have a program as complicated as

783
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,940
you want it to be so probably this will

784
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:45,920
be implemented on one of those systems

785
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:48,460
because bitcoins blockchain was not

786
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,810
designed with this in mind so probably

787
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,490
but it still it's been quite an a

788
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,920
contribution to say they out of a block

789
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:57,080
change as a concept it's amazing it's

790
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,820
mind-blowing and that's why people are

791
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,400
so excited about it because I actually

792
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:05,030
sorts out the problem that was out there

793
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,520
but still the recipient or new designs

794
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:10,010
will come in and yet bitcoins blockchain

795
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,040
as I said we'll be there just for

796
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:15,500
currency support and I find it difficult

797
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,600
to have this coin out of its niche

798
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,450
because you've got the usability gap up

799
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:23,868
there still difficult to use Bitcoin as

800
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:28,189
you see Barry better

801
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:30,770
sorry the former Greek and financial

802
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,810
minister he was a bit upset you want me

803
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:36,380
out of the euro I will leave you and

804
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:38,650
little use Bitcoin as my carotid was bit

805
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,650
silly

806
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:44,940
I'm jealous as i seed bitcoins currency

807
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,650
I don't think I don't think we'll get

808
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,600
out of the niche beat this idea of

809
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:52,140
blockchain of course we'll make it out

810
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:54,509
of the niche you save Bitcoin to bunker

811
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:57,299
at NM and you upset them but blockchain

812
00:43:54,510 --> 00:44:00,750
they like it they like the idea itself

813
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:02,430
because it's in a septic or septic so

814
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,580
you can be used elsewhere and there's

815
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:08,609
another miss can you take the block

816
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:10,770
chain our way from the coin well now the

817
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:15,210
block chain is safe just because there

818
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:18,300
is ace currency support because there's

819
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:20,100
this well-known working tests that's the

820
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,250
mining that now they're trying to

821
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:26,640
incentive eight people encourage them to

822
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:29,640
behave to work just for the good of the

823
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,310
community of the network if you take out

824
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,650
the working test it will crash this is

825
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:36,630
in will not work so thanks come up with

826
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:40,440
other solutions at signature buying such

827
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:44,040
a fatass heart block chain right so a

828
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,310
blockchain makes sense just if it gives

829
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:49,140
its full potential within an environment

830
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:53,549
where there is a more less public access

831
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:56,850
if you restrict to a private chain and a

832
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,950
graph such as well known participants on

833
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,319
the limited amount there you don't need

834
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:04,950
a work a test system you can have it

835
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:08,190
organized using the well-known

836
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:11,299
cryptographic logarithms you need it to

837
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:15,910
have its potential develop outside

838
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:22,040
any more questions I'm blinded by the DS

839
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:23,839
what hi two questions related to what's

840
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:30,470
been asked will write about yet a start

841
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:33,170
of identity this chain of trust yes yeah

842
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:35,509
you say that it's cost effective by the

843
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:37,820
head there is a lack of identity that

844
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:41,030
would be from the point of view of block

845
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,890
change for private use such in the bank

846
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,800
there you need signature right but for

847
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:47,569
the public or the public is I guess the

848
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,280
only way to make sure that a person is

849
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:53,900
who they say they are all that a

850
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,970
signature is theirs would mean that we

851
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:01,370
need to have a central authority in

852
00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:05,990
place a past board support whatever and

853
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:08,000
then for private block chains well you

854
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:10,160
only have a limited amount of notes the

855
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,530
incentive for an outside attacker not

856
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,830
for the participant which is very high

857
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:18,650
but with a limited at a capacity you can

858
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:21,350
actually subvert a system like this is

859
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:23,180
there any research on the topic anyway

860
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,700
you've contracted well last thing you

861
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:29,390
mentioned is very interesting yes let's

862
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:32,450
a nap banks let's set up a series of

863
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:34,700
blocks block chains for us for ourselves

864
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:37,910
how many banks are there in Spain in

865
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:40,060
Europa couple hundreds right that's not

866
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:44,779
safe because we only have limited

867
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:47,570
participants and fill these system

868
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,370
cannot be just transfer to the banking

869
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:52,490
system just like that and the identity

870
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:55,490
yes it's interesting if we want to

871
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:56,819
preserve as well certified traditional

872
00:46:55,490 --> 00:47:00,209
identity

873
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:03,240
to have it connected to a PK ah which by

874
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:06,000
definition is very central there's

875
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:09,509
nothing more central than a pain k I and

876
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:14,790
we have disputed identity system systems

877
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:18,840
but they don't work for traditional sale

878
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:23,370
systems too well I'm Airbnb orever would

879
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:25,140
you rent your house to someone he on who

880
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,880
you have no information no information

881
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:30,720
can be found in them so this is all

882
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,630
based on multi signature custody systems

883
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:38,700
that work the middleman and use multi

884
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:41,940
signatures for it the use of those

885
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,950
elements so instead of paying you the

886
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,930
end user because you want to rent in my

887
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:48,890
house for a disability service instead

888
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:52,230
of paying you I pee custody system and

889
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:55,440
we use a multi signature system so they

890
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:58,170
cannot use that amount of money without

891
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,450
my authorization or yours so if

892
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:03,300
everything works out you get the Pegman

893
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:08,189
thesis at trust triangle this is the

894
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:10,920
only way to do so it is just a crashing

895
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:12,930
the this idea of trust I've thought of

896
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,790
it I thought how this can be linked

897
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:17,520
because those are public is all in all

898
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:20,220
and in the end we'll start with public

899
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,280
keys from passport not words and then we

900
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:25,350
generate and produce the keys and

901
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,870
elliptical curves and Bitcoin but the

902
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:31,339
minute did this so there is no canceling

903
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:31,339
I'm trying I'm trying though

904
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:47,670
crazy Billy team on your first lights

905
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:49,980
you say that it was not traceable when

906
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:52,200
all transactions are of an Edwin and Ira

907
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,970
physical doubt at all times it's not

908
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,850
anonymous but it's traceable it's not

909
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:59,250
the same day yes yes I I was not clear

910
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,990
what I meant is that you cannot take it

911
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:03,450
all the way down to a physical identity

912
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:05,459
that's what I meant it is fully

913
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:08,580
traceable at us as you've heard it maybe

914
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:11,610
I was not clear enough it's not

915
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:13,590
identifiable maybe it was a misnomer

916
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:17,220
it's not fully on animals either there

917
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:20,310
is a interesting paper where they

918
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:22,560
managed to find the identity with a

919
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:24,630
crypto Locker this one normal were using

920
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,620
plastering techniques that they managed

921
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:32,210
to said that some Bitcoin address this

922
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,210
 be

923
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:37,119
those are the crypto lockers and

924
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:42,549
creators or author so they managed to

925
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:43,690
identify that more questions no more

926
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,850
questions will thank you very much for

927
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:48,660
your attention and for getting up these

928
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,660
early thank you very much
