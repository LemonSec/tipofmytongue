1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,220
here we go how are you doing hackers are

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:10,590
you having about here yes mm-hmm ears

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,780
app you're sad players hello everybody

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,059
thank you for coming here today is

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,210
Saturday a pleasure to be waiting that

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,400
you mean yeah what a pleasure working

7
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:24,750
saturday morning here everybody here

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,570
with me for today I prepare a talk about

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,900
something that is strutting around my

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:34,110
head for the past few years I've just

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,239
rip out my slides all demos are going to

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,510
crash out to be a failure it's gonna be

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,899
total disaster you may be like it so my

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,930
talks about low-hanging fruit that

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,730
refers to a turn that insecurity is very

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,320
well known you know what is low-hanging

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:54,989
fruit you're zapped your sad please very

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,039
few people low-hanging fruit means easy

19
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:02,250
to find facts I've been working auditing

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,729
security systems and one of the things I

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,909
found out is that more and more you were

22
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,939
axed to audit many things and little

23
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,090
time you were state little money did you

24
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:20,070
experience this before yes so this is a

25
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:24,140
very typical of fam so so those who do

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,779
in pen testing our objective is to do

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,909
report as to be well paid for out so we

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,060
have been working there from them the

29
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,810
deer herd which is which is that hurt

30
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,560
dear to evaluate and get a super cool

31
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:45,990
report of incidences well my while my

32
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:50,970
audit him in computing the company sandy

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:53,280
waters we created a to created and the

34
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,329
name was a seal the seal looked for the

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,810
more vulnerability in the third deer in

36
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:03,449
the asses in the Communists as the Lions

37
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,240
hunt the deer how many have seen and

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,979
watch the channel two documentaries oh

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,790
hell did the deer run so quickly so it

40
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:14,069
is

41
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,489
if you if you put it in a slow motion

42
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:22,890
you can see how the deer turns around

43
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:27,650
and jokes and had fun at the deer so the

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:31,828
Lions hand they put side back on the

45
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:36,269
block of deers the deal with the belly

46
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:39,239
full of water the weaker deer is Hampton

47
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,430
by the line when you do intrusion on the

48
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:42,930
internet you don't go to the main server

49
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,599
because it's the most secure eyes one

50
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,000
you run through all the assets and you

51
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,429
check out what is the low-hanging fruit

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,250
which is the herd deer in this race

53
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,459
which is the weaker point-blank being

54
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,680
the weakest to enter into the castle so

55
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,500
we are moving from one server and to the

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,930
other and assets and play around these

57
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,470
permissions in the security world we

58
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,950
have seen over the past years that there

59
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:14,549
are so many important bugs which were

60
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:17,819
not that complicated as to attack should

61
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:20,280
they be oddities such as cell thought

62
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,750
there were the most remarkable bags

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,379
impacting the security on the internet

64
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:31,349
this opened my eyes and especially minds

65
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:34,078
regarding so simple yet important facts

66
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,540
there is an initiative promoted by

67
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:40,500
google google project zero whose

68
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:45,690
objective is to end up the low-hanging

69
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:48,659
fruit google google has put several

70
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:52,260
group of researchers to research on the

71
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:55,709
nose from use technologies internet what

72
00:03:52,260 --> 00:04:01,220
are the low-hanging fruit bags so the in

73
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:05,220
an open apache or am massively use

74
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:08,040
software this elizabeth south so Baxter

75
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,780
this is the main idea underlining so

76
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,828
when we go back to the enterprise world

77
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:16,440
we don't talk about software bags we

78
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:20,630
talk about in more evidence I don't know

79
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:24,349
if some of you is responsible in such

80
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:28,229
the company but since this being the

81
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:31,409
security officer is a tough job they're

82
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:34,260
such a complex issue for us to do so

83
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:38,340
that to wrap up the low-hanging fruit is

84
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:41,599
very difficult this is a report recently

85
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,130
published by the national security

86
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,909
homeland security department from the

87
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,639
USA ass off december this year in which

88
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:54,659
they talked about the deficiencies in to

89
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,940
security within their just stays

90
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:59,250
National Security Department so they

91
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,130
also have low hanging fruit a lot about

92
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,139
my abilities over the way these reports

93
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,710
shows there are operating systems

94
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:10,050
without being patch which is something

95
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,020
for them personally responsible student

96
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:16,889
is a real pain in the neck besides they

97
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,279
also have all the utilities which are

98
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:23,699
usually expected by the exploitation

99
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:27,599
kids are not updated flash Firefox

100
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:31,020
Chrome with dives they are not updated

101
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:33,659
which means that there are big evident

102
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,150
failures everybody with a mega exploit

103
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:38,729
over the right expedition to they came

104
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,460
targeted so let's move on to another

105
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:46,320
operating system which are not updated

106
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:48,719
without touch we password with our

107
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,349
second factor identification so many

108
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:53,520
vulnerabilities that are easily

109
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:55,740
exploitable an attack Yvonne you don't

110
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,710
need to go to a rocket science or

111
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,080
advanced first persistent threat to

112
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:04,560
attack a company in fact most of the

113
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,060
times a Tucker is getting into the

114
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,800
bigger learning station they are not

115
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,919
doing a complex than just the opposite

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,589
they are didn't speak fishing at that

117
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,930
within the network they a scale up and

118
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:18,419
down and so forth and so forth and so

119
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,320
forth so I can give you some examples of

120
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,109
Logan

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:28,260
good i got some demos i will start with

122
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:30,660
this this is this is the clear program

123
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:35,010
when i was in the stay is presenting for

124
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:38,430
cam or toll we created in 2007 in the

125
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:41,130
building systems i presented a pretty

126
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,960
constant demo where i went into the

127
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,170
internet i check out for the tablet

128
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,549
computing documents notation i did it

129
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,010
back then with the military in the

130
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,670
states within the American missile

131
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:56,730
agency we downloaded the documents we

132
00:06:53,670 --> 00:07:00,930
extracted the data and we map the

133
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:03,270
internal esculentus chitin after that

134
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,330
we're at the same time at the stage then

135
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,710
publish this program clear to avoid

136
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:13,950
published documents without being

137
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:18,000
metadata cleaned properly the truth is

138
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:21,090
that this does not work that is well

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,160
unfortunately I sort of today after so

140
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:29,789
long this seal batley down and we we got

141
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,170
low hanging fruit again let us enlarge

142
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:41,000
the image for its it properly can you

143
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:45,450
said properly good firstly I did them

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,220
demo with the MA point 1000 which is the

145
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:51,440
American missile aliens you know is

146
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:54,500
school the super cool am i am i right so

147
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:59,060
we went into google we downloaded

148
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:03,540
documents can we compete in office

149
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,820
documents extension do seem so the MDA

150
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,420
didn't like it and they thought about

151
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:13,170
all this let's delete the document saw

152
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:16,530
everything is sorted out the thing is

153
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:19,980
that even the this agency eliminated

154
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:22,020
these documents with a clear program you

155
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,150
can go to this web stand which is

156
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,450
scorpion all the archives you consider

157
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,650
on screen and you can type in md a

158
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,719
pinpoint one thousand documents

159
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:35,228
and let's see what happens we got all

160
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,250
the copies and back at from MDA point

161
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:41,260
one thousand from 2005 2013 with

162
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:46,020
asterisks and slashes we can get all the

163
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:49,290
files and we ask for when there is not

164
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,640
loading be eat me give me back

165
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:55,569
exclusively and only now it's loading

166
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:59,020
please slow down I can you sit please

167
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:02,410
get me back exclusively and solely files

168
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:05,380
point the old sea dog we can see all the

169
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,850
files of it were initially taken out but

170
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,600
there are still out there they're still

171
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,990
with metadata IP addresses user data all

172
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,250
this leaking of information is not a

173
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,870
disappear the only effective way that

174
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,700
would be that this metadata information

175
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,100
would not be affected it should have

176
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,550
changes but in spite of the program

177
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,820
clear existed and let's check out for

178
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:32,439
domain point 1000 let's check out files

179
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:38,529
PDF that in the field at the title name

180
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:45,660
you have to see users in order to get us

181
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:51,760
up today in entitled see users see point

182
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:57,520
1000x PDF did I type it in public now in

183
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:04,240
title seeing City users I didn't get

184
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:07,250
right on screen side side yes let's take

185
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,130
it out like this if we

186
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,280
we'll take it out on army domain which

187
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:17,210
is that in the military domain side army

188
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:20,870
we can see how us off today all users

189
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:23,330
using the military are stealing within

190
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:29,420
metadata so we can see that Jennifer Lee

191
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:34,130
Taylor is natick point meal this is what

192
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:37,030
a user and so on zone so years later

193
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:41,330
afternoon all the leaking of data

194
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:44,540
problem did the army point mean we would

195
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:47,480
have a data cleaning house still very

196
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,410
same issue not only that systematically

197
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,080
we can see the people once and again are

198
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,939
making the very same mistakes one of the

199
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,760
most typical biggest mysteries we can

200
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,420
see is how people are used in mobile

201
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,680
applications to promote their size and

202
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,329
they are transferring and web-based

203
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,770
technology into the mobile phone and

204
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,050
they're making so many mystics i will

205
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,780
show you one simple example with a lot

206
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,540
of film backs and failures which are

207
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,390
easily exploitable and you don't need

208
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:24,400
text specific technology to expect them

209
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:28,880
as how we can attack an organization

210
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:33,560
let's move on to the browser the life

211
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,439
find it yeah but I stole lock away

212
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,780
atheras a way out ed Sheeran elementa no

213
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,680
extra cannot permit I'm using a tool of

214
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:45,020
ourselves it allows us to research on

215
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,359
the mobile and applications works for

216
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,060
Android this is big data with all the

217
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,880
applications android phase 3 and this

218
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,310
allows us to look for things over here

219
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:59,089
so as of today we got a cloud-based

220
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,859
computing platform mood around internet

221
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:03,290
00 around all the markets looking for

222
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,910
apps from the android world they

223
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:09,980
downloaded they index them with a and

224
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,630
all the contextual information work when

225
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,900
there were plaques and publish and they

226
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:17,330
put in into edited base to be check out

227
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:21,480
this big date that we had

228
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:23,700
4.7 abson four-point million apps so we

229
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:28,470
can see so many things I've been

230
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:31,320
researching on which is the dab a bit it

231
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:35,850
is that induction techniques are well

232
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:40,620
known for you 2009 oh I published an

233
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:44,250
article data injection where I talk

234
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,680
about the injection techniques one of

235
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:50,460
the things of that what companies have

236
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:54,719
to have regarding developing software is

237
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:57,690
you need to secure mobile applications I

238
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,180
conducted the test which is let's check

239
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,610
out for applications on Android that

240
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:09,680
within the code they have a link to a

241
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:16,710
servant of I da p give me all ends to a

242
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:19,979
hostname with LD AP so I'm taking out I

243
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:24,060
got 24 some of them are eliminated the

244
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,970
application itself has been taken out if

245
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:32,369
we consider the eliminated applications

246
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:34,170
we got four info davay my TV and several

247
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:37,320
of them in this very case if we check

248
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:41,430
out this in particular and we check out

249
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:45,270
for the links we check out da pele our

250
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:47,550
lane we notice that they are you stay

251
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,010
back here based upon web services when

252
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,060
you take out an application on this

253
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:54,510
application has to be taken out

254
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,670
completely and you need to take out the

255
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,939
back hand in this very case you can see

256
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:03,479
all on service as working in the club

257
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,690
they take out the app and not date back

258
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,339
in which is a very very lander so check

259
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:12,690
out this one which will give us the

260
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:17,370
whole list of users to be done this is a

261
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:20,550
swap request that we need to use the

262
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,010
back end is working so we can behave as

263
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,540
the application and working with this

264
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:31,770
repository

265
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:35,040
for in doing so we open a big we do

266
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,569
birth shade we configure the tour

267
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,329
settings and we are still working with

268
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,540
the same server let's move on so far so

269
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:45,330
good we used the repeater to send a

270
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:50,780
request which is now configured over

271
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:56,100
here I copy copy it and I'm connecting

272
00:14:50,780 --> 00:15:00,060
myself with the server on the web Scott

273
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,830
serviced we are making a post petition

274
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:06,930
and we are typing in the consultation

275
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:10,920
and create a user a password directly we

276
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,349
are asked to do the consultation from

277
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,689
the user and that means user phrases but

278
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,360
we lack the credentials nothing's

279
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,700
happened because we were lacking some

280
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,550
credential that if the application is

281
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,380
working against this back hem of the

282
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,560
application is what gains backhand

283
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:32,330
probably this convention will be in the

284
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:35,189
code in this case the application is

285
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:38,970
downloaded because our database not only

286
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:45,140
a key content but also the application

287
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:48,300
codified so I'm only connecting myself

288
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:52,560
with an application to decompile the

289
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:56,609
code i connect myself to so my code and

290
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,010
I check out for the application this

291
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:03,020
very case application scary is my view p

292
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:07,439
now it's totally decompressed and I've

293
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:10,800
decompile the whole data oh I've Justin

294
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,370
I didn't I didn't decompress it totally

295
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,800
so I'm going to locks I login a check

296
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,560
out for the compressed code and become

297
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,199
pile I decompile the compares I got all

298
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,510
the application code now i'm looking for

299
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,600
the credentials within the code so i'm

300
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:32,390
looking for the file i connect to the

301
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,900
find myself and here this is

302
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:39,439
let's see what it is on the application

303
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:41,420
and insect all the files this is on bike

304
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,360
pro so let's take out the file from

305
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:49,520
there correctly and the file it will

306
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:53,900
fight where is it over here we got in

307
00:16:49,520 --> 00:17:00,110
this race case is some log in to point

308
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:02,689
dash I type in I put the cat shop and we

309
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,910
can see how the call to the web services

310
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,430
done which is worth doing now and how

311
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:12,260
this has been used we are using a user

312
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:15,650
password directly onto here is another

313
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,810
beginners mistakes they left it here the

314
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,870
end of the show is as simple as this we

315
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:26,869
go to burp we configure the user

316
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:30,350
password login as if we were the

317
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:33,020
application ourselves we configure the

318
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:36,980
password the user and now we can ask for

319
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:39,530
whatever it is in this very case the

320
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:43,160
only thing we did is to still work in

321
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:45,680
function oh we see this the server

322
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,070
cannot process the petition the repairs

323
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,070
why

324
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,139
well perhaps this password has been

325
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,720
changed someone changed the password

326
00:17:56,139 --> 00:18:04,110
well there's nothing we can do all in

327
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:08,860
all what we are doing we are just

328
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:12,309
tapping or using a beginner's mistake to

329
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:16,449
entry the sides in the corporate world

330
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:19,830
when you have to reposition security one

331
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:25,330
of the things that you will hear is like

332
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:30,609
antivirus are useless who think so all

333
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:33,609
right so when we talk about long low

334
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:36,070
hanging fruit one of the most curious

335
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:38,379
things is that people expect that one

336
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,779
technology will help correct everything

337
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:45,759
and they go and tell you av's our juices

338
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:49,239
or firewalls are useless or that users

339
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:51,850
control is useless but at the end of the

340
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:55,359
day no technology is one hundred percent

341
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:57,879
secure and no single technology will

342
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,850
remove all the problems if someone

343
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:04,689
thinks that av's are useless it that

344
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:08,109
person is mistaken they play a crucial

345
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:10,480
role to detect whatever is known if

346
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:14,559
someone believes that common sense is

347
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,179
enough for not being involved in a

348
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,249
security problem what you are browsing

349
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:20,499
to have a problem you have a problem

350
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:22,509
enjoy don't understand what happens is

351
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:24,429
the worlds of security security is much

352
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:27,730
more complex than that it is true that

353
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:29,950
there is no single security only and

354
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,590
then technologies have more and more

355
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,960
problems they have problems over time

356
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,668
but these problems are fixed over time

357
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,919
and as I said there are no one hundred

358
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:41,169
percent security technologies this is an

359
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,649
example that was made with windows 95

360
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:47,080
cool remembers window no 95 okay if you

361
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:48,998
skip the logging of windows 95 it was as

362
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,570
easy as to ask for help and to go into

363
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:57,159
that so what we find is that why we work

364
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:59,590
in security there are many new words

365
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,979
showing up all the time for instance

366
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:05,949
postpartum cryptography anti apts

367
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:08,440
machine learning savvy Brazilians so

368
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:12,460
very many technologies that many heads

369
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:16,330
of security or companies and brace when

370
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:19,029
it comes to develop the security plans

371
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:21,849
and projects and this is all good it is

372
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:25,210
all good that we apply cryptography by

373
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:29,139
the time we will have post quantum pcs

374
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:32,889
it's not bad either to include anti apts

375
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:35,320
and that I cloud takes a new cut cool

376
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:36,908
bags and to use machine learning to

377
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,470
control whatever happens in the network

378
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:41,080
of many companies and to detect

379
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,609
anomalies not only in the traffic of our

380
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,158
own network but also in the traffic of

381
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:48,609
other very many networks but what it is

382
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:51,340
essential is crucial is that security

383
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:55,389
also needs anti viruses and he also

384
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,988
needs all the basics so in this world of

385
00:20:55,389 --> 00:21:01,449
passwords I have an idea an idea to

386
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:03,639
become reaching 10 steps I've seen that

387
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,609
many times in many security companies

388
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:09,008
the colisee where they run a company

389
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:12,340
they say that antivirus are just garbage

390
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:14,830
that they are just useless then we point

391
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:18,580
out the limits of security text then we

392
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:21,369
call previous techniques technology

393
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,970
resolving a problem and then we come up

394
00:21:21,369 --> 00:21:30,820
with a very nice term apt then we've

395
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:35,470
analyzed it so we make all the security

396
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:40,479
heads make it included in the planning

397
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:42,549
and then by the time we go I put all

398
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:44,649
these disappears okay because the

399
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,869
company is eventually sold so that

400
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:48,488
happens in all these security companies

401
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:50,918
at the end of the day toes technology

402
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:54,909
have their own limits and there will be

403
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:58,090
one more piece within the any company

404
00:21:54,909 --> 00:22:01,309
security strategy but not the only one

405
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:04,490
so in this case we just tested some camp

406
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:07,249
in the magic quadrant so there were

407
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:10,850
leaders in dlp data loss protection

408
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:13,279
prevention and well the test that we did

409
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,959
was very simple we went to the side we

410
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,970
downloaded the documents and we wanted

411
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,720
to see whether there was any leak of

412
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:24,980
data and one hundred percent of them had

413
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:29,059
leaked of data you from meta data only

414
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:31,129
one of them didn't have it so at the end

415
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:33,080
of the day when companies are being

416
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:35,240
attacked all systems are being attacked

417
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,820
the vulnerabilities that continue to be

418
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,720
deuced at low hanging fruit number one

419
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:45,110
today continues to be injections

420
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,179
techniques SQL injection commands

421
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:52,008
injections these techniques have been

422
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:55,429
known for many years as he year SQL

423
00:22:52,009 --> 00:23:00,080
injection was discovered back in 1998 we

424
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:02,509
are close to entering 2016 so this

425
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,580
technique technique technique could be

426
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:06,289
older than some of the people presenting

427
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,199
here if we go to the department of

428
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:11,629
homeland security document even the

429
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,619
Homeland Security Department has

430
00:23:11,629 --> 00:23:19,428
admitted having SQL injection in the

431
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:21,470
company again so it is so basic when it

432
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:23,899
comes to managing two companies that you

433
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,869
have two options such as in frozen you

434
00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:28,699
have Elsa and Anna you know that the

435
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:32,269
main characters the protagonist is Anna

436
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:36,619
who knows Anna who has seen frozen okay

437
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:38,629
ears up who hasn't watched frozen please

438
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:44,178
those of you who haven't watched frozen

439
00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:48,070
leave the room immediately but you all

440
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:51,379
have heard the track let it go don't you

441
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:54,080
alright in this movie there are two

442
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:57,769
protagonists Elsa who is the queen of

443
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,139
snow and Anna who is powerless you'll

444
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:02,659
sell the powerful one cannot control her

445
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:06,408
powers at a given point in time in the

446
00:24:02,659 --> 00:24:09,030
movie Elsa goes into her castle gets

447
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:11,630
enclosed in there and then sings

448
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:15,030
son the lead glow and she's encouraging

449
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:19,770
herself and say I feel secure I feel I

450
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:22,410
have and actually she is just crap in

451
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:26,070
the end you know she cries and she goes

452
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:29,490
down and Anna who hasn't got any power

453
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:33,120
she is the one who fights really hard to

454
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:37,140
save her sister one of them feel secure

455
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:40,500
and the other one is secure or confident

456
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,440
the singles with companies the and then

457
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,890
we had a third company companies who

458
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,490
pretend to be secure so Ashley Madison I

459
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:54,660
very much love what they say below icon

460
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:57,300
and cycle 100% trusted and then of

461
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:00,240
course as L of course they have to show

462
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:04,379
that to be honest and I'm telling you

463
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,690
all this because I'm fed up of hearing

464
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:11,720
many people selling security people

465
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:15,200
talking security pretending all huh

466
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:18,300
expecting that a tool a single to

467
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,180
resolve some fixes all the security

468
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,970
issues so and this is not possible you

469
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,680
have to manage people taken process to

470
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,900
get integrity confidentiality and

471
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,600
availability and reaching acceptable

472
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:34,260
risks making your company resilience and

473
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,709
having your company complying with the

474
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,230
aldi legislation and this is not easy ok

475
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:45,510
so I'm showing you the photograph of

476
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:51,150
these people in 2006 07 and this person

477
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:53,580
was interviews and he's not very

478
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:55,800
friendly person he's got a reputation

479
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,919
for that and he was asked why they

480
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:02,490
didn't include Oh hands new people

481
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:05,100
working in the kernel liners and thin

482
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,950
and he admitted that they were not like

483
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:11,370
an open community but he said that the

484
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:15,030
time for simple problems and simple

485
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:18,600
solutions is over so what leanest what

486
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:22,539
turbit said about the line

487
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,850
lena colonel has to be applied to the

488
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,129
world of security if someone believes

489
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,899
that money in security in the company is

490
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,630
a simple thing to do this person is

491
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,900
fully mistaken and if that person

492
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:38,080
believes that that security problem will

493
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:43,690
be fixed through trendy technology

494
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:47,678
that's very very mistaken so you have to

495
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:51,760
make your system much more robust you

496
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:54,159
have to hardness to harden systems you

497
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,789
have to harden your people you have to

498
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:00,159
make you people aware of security risks

499
00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:02,110
do have to influence them so that they

500
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,950
do not generate any promise to you and

501
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:09,158
you have to train your employees you'll

502
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,580
have to attack them all the time so by

503
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,900
the time they will be attacked by and

504
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,539
third-party company they are ready for

505
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,870
that and you also have to harden your

506
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:21,820
processes you have to take care

507
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:24,219
providers you have to develop software

508
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:26,950
so nowadays will have companies

509
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,950
developing software with very many

510
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:34,210
trivial floors do you know what I told

511
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:37,570
you about the password before happens to

512
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,429
companies listed index some of the

513
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:42,610
companies listed in the stock exchange

514
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:46,990
in the IV's certified index so when it

515
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:50,168
comes to tackling security anyone who

516
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:52,870
works oh who wants to manage the

517
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,789
security and his company that is to say

518
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,580
a person who wants to be confident a

519
00:27:54,789 --> 00:28:01,120
person who wants to be secure that

520
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:03,580
person should do the basics and as I say

521
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,590
on the screen ok you have to patch the

522
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,189
gnome box you have to change default

523
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:12,780
password you have to harden default

524
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:16,120
configurations down code with easy bugs

525
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:19,149
teach Oh trained security to your people

526
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:24,428
Dupin testing apply security

527
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:26,440
cryptography so the security 101 in

528
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:28,389
terms of the

529
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,610
basics they're very very large there are

530
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:32,500
many things to do in your company before

531
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,809
you go and buy a super fashion

532
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,389
technology to resolve a specific problem

533
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:40,450
against a criminal organization that may

534
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:43,479
attack you from the outside and we don't

535
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,970
only have the 101 we also have this

536
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:51,700
ability to a one but you have to do and

537
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:53,409
die ap C code reviews hands or hard in

538
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,240
your network even more but don't you

539
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:57,759
have them other than three you have to

540
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,700
do predictive text alex the privileged

541
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:04,090
account control digital surveillance all

542
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:06,220
that and then you have to end up in the

543
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:10,330
coolest things I've very much

544
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:12,759
passionated for cool things I only know

545
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,730
a few companies who have a well-designed

546
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:19,750
map for the organization's they have a

547
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:23,409
network mapping including Wi-Fi and

548
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:28,710
structured cabling but they forget about

549
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:34,029
the USBs that are inserted into the

550
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:36,460
computers of the networks if you were to

551
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:41,379
analyze that you will find out that many

552
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:44,889
pen drives are being inserted into into

553
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:46,539
computers and they work like beads you

554
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:49,418
know they go from from one flower to

555
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:51,279
another if you want to investigate mal

556
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:54,129
well you can take a look at what you

557
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,250
have now and you also take a look at

558
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:59,639
what you had in the past to create

559
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:04,149
historical trends and then by the time

560
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:07,178
malware tools or anti viruses are being

561
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:10,779
updated you really want to find out

562
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:13,240
about that so security you can always

563
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:17,580
add one more layer to protect your

564
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:20,909
system because there is no technology

565
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:23,710
delivering one hundred percent security

566
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:27,110
because because we still have low hung

567
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:32,200
low hanging fruit and for that we

568
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:32,199
developed a tool the name of it is fast

569
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:45,610
and I'll shove it to you ok I'll do it

570
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:45,610
through apple I like to show it in Apple

571
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:07,520
ok I go to apple domain but these

572
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:15,740
technology looks for the assets of a

573
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:18,650
company scans twentyforseven the data of

574
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,860
the company and they have a scanning

575
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:28,010
base where all the vulnerabilities are

576
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:31,699
and stored so it's doing pen testing 365

577
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:35,000
days and I do that with Apple because

578
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,250
Apple is hacker friendly if you report

579
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,410
from their abilities you will have no

580
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:43,970
problems okay now I'll tell you what you

581
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:47,600
can find in Apple so the actual apple

582
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:50,720
also has problems to manage the parting

583
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,870
of all the vulnerabilities well some

584
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,030
service are not patched for

585
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:59,449
vulnerabilities if someone wants to

586
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:02,410
heart Apple will use those

587
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:07,190
vulnerabilities but we may also find and

588
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:10,309
servers that do not have URLs of other

589
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:13,549
domains what they are working so mixed

590
00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:17,418
content that you can do ssl strip that

591
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:19,700
is to say to show one file under that

592
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:23,030
ssl and then the rest of the information

593
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:27,620
to transfer it without that SS l some

594
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:30,559
cookies do not have any PHP they can be

595
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:33,040
captured through JavaScript perhaps

596
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,350
there is some advertising tracking a

597
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,520
cookie or PHP that is using that so at

598
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,428
the end of the day when you have to

599
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,850
manage a very

600
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:44,700
company if you do a security auditing

601
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:46,379
once every six months or once a year you

602
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,320
will be getting lots and lots of

603
00:32:46,379 --> 00:33:00,389
low-hanging fruit and that will make you

604
00:32:49,320 --> 00:33:02,820
very vulnerable of course by the time

605
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:04,529
you will evaluate the investment that

606
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,259
you are being made in security in your

607
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:09,929
company it is also very important to

608
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:14,970
take into account your level of maturity

609
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:21,389
maturity to assume where you are that is

610
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:23,999
to say with a capacity to recognize find

611
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:26,219
out about the basics that are still and

612
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:29,309
tackled for you to know that no matter

613
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:31,529
how much invest you will have attackers

614
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:34,080
in your network whether you like it or

615
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:36,210
not they will always be there and you

616
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,220
have to assume it and even if you are

617
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:41,369
not talking about an external attacker

618
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,429
could be someone in the company who

619
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:46,519
wants to steal or to breach data and

620
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:49,320
your company and you might as well have

621
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:52,590
technology in place to fight those

622
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:57,360
attackers and you have to make enough

623
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:59,249
investments and assuming that you will

624
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:05,719
be successful and that you will have to

625
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:07,610
respond to the attacks so please Bella

626
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,330
so you know that this summer the lounge

627
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:16,730
them they found a vulnerability in the

628
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:21,319
jeep chrysler so they took the control

629
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:25,190
of the cpu of a deep car and they do it

630
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:28,580
remotely and actually they did it they

631
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:33,679
took advantage of cars being connected

632
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:37,759
through a network of data so they just

633
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,069
set up the false base station that was 2

634
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,940
g's so when the car came they did

635
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:46,550
jamming they connected to the base

636
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,350
station then the car was connected to

637
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,840
the false based then they launched the

638
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,699
exploit and they change the

639
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,130
configuration of the car but they did

640
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:58,370
was just to stop the brakes that was

641
00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:05,180
very famous that was very famous at the

642
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:10,009
end of were reported by Jeep well many

643
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:12,950
people doesn't know but well Tesla cars

644
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:15,530
were hacked this summer ok who knew that

645
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,779
who didn't know that well the same

646
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,930
happened with Tesla okay so some

647
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,490
vulnerabilities to control Tesla

648
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,669
remotely so the difference between those

649
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:28,089
companies is that one company comes from

650
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:30,020
the digital worlds and it's more mature

651
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,090
digitally speaking whereas the other

652
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,700
company comes from the physical world

653
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:36,860
and it is not that mature in cyber

654
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:39,620
security to resolve the problem jeep

655
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:43,100
well first sends out a pen drive with a

656
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:46,220
patch to all the car owners imagine in

657
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:49,520
person that knows nothing about pc with

658
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:52,970
the bed and driving his hands were we

659
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:56,750
were shall instead inserted is so that

660
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:59,720
didn't work has to come well imagine so

661
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:02,960
therefore the organized training courses

662
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:06,399
for all the dealers but they trained all

663
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,560
the operators to update the jeep and

664
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,170
software then they also set up a cold

665
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,710
center they called all the jeep owners

666
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,590
after the ship owners to bring the car

667
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:20,860
to the dealer to

668
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:24,190
patch the vulnerabilities but not all

669
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:27,900
the owners took the car to the dealer so

670
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:32,260
you calculate the amount of money that

671
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:34,900
all these positives to Jeep is huge

672
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:37,930
amount of money and also the bad

673
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:41,050
reputation in the media okay Tesla Tesla

674
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:43,450
they just inserted reduced the patch by

675
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:49,080
default and they fix the problem in 15

676
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:51,580
minutes so meaning that even security

677
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,340
maturity of your company is very high

678
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:56,890
and if you have a problem you will be

679
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,370
able to resolve the problem very soon so

680
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:02,589
if you really want to manage the company

681
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:05,319
the security of your company first of

682
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:08,050
all balance the investment that you are

683
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,410
doing on physical security and digital

684
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:14,020
security and I'm saying so because many

685
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:16,629
companies and I guess many in your

686
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:19,870
company's you may see security guards

687
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:23,860
everywhere and sometimes security guards

688
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:28,540
that are staring at a camera that is

689
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:31,320
pointing as the garage door and they are

690
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:36,150
watching a weathered our garage door

691
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:40,180
opens or closes sometimes happens it

692
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:45,460
full in shift in the working shift that

693
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:50,290
is like 150 thousand euros per year does

694
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:53,410
the expense of for companies ok this is

695
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:56,890
for you to have a feel as to how your

696
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,690
company is investing money in security

697
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:01,240
however when it comes to digital

698
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:06,100
security the investment is never as

699
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:07,660
large as in physical security second do

700
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:12,098
the basics

701
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:16,410
it is very well that in the master plan

702
00:38:12,099 --> 00:38:19,930
for next year you include I know buying

703
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:22,950
apts or state-of-the-art technology

704
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:27,339
perfect but before that do the basics

705
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:32,859
manage these security updates manage the

706
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:35,558
patches so do not do not oil change the

707
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:38,859
default password of your router's okay

708
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:42,760
some companies do not change the default

709
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:45,279
password so remove the low-hanging fruit

710
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:50,470
in your company that's a vector of

711
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:54,849
attack so some listed companies say that

712
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:57,009
they are validly in thirty thousand

713
00:38:54,849 --> 00:38:59,559
million dollars and they were involved

714
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:01,780
in a security and they were asked a bad

715
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:03,970
well was the attack done through

716
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,730
spearfishing and say yes it was done

717
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:09,399
through spear fishing again said you

718
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:14,799
should configure your email properly and

719
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:17,859
do more than the basics go to 102 103 do

720
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:21,339
it and do it so that it is sustainable

721
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:24,970
in the future and last by the super

722
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:27,690
fashion tech and that's all for me thank

723
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,689
