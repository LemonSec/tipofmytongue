1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,250
I thought hello everybody good afternoon

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:12,599
my name is Luis the very truth is I

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,540
would like to start telling you why I'm

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,890
here you would be very identified with

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,419
myself with many things i'm going to

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:25,380
tell you i started aged 12 years with

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,619
the free software you may be developers

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,359
you or not but you're using software in

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,689
your everyday activities on your

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:38,280
smartphones with androids perhaps or

11
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:41,160
perhaps with your in the browser i mean

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,890
i was interested in freedom liberty and

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,190
pay attention to how systems journalists

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,670
speaking systems are is silly breakable

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,390
invulnerable not only by Agence but

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,670
other agents from then moment on I

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,309
decide on getting involved in the free

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,789
software because I was able to see what

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:06,780
the code was doing the code was sending

20
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:10,409
my locations to God servers every 36 sub

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,140
today this happens a lot many times so I

22
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,549
got involved in this i did a linux

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,880
distribution by nemesis strikes i named

24
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:24,990
it as strict because this girl i can

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,110
impress to yes this region the idea is

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,890
to move the operating systems linux and

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,619
so on around the world basically my

28
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,990
mother started working there is one year

29
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:41,250
ago has to be able to use her linux

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:44,789
distribution free software us she could

31
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,070
be able to use a mac computer I was with

32
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,229
this Angela I

33
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,199
was 15 years doesn't then I started

34
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,380
doing quest log in when you completely

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,410
get you can get into the website with

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,240
your face through a webcam with free

37
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:04,460
contributions to the free software when

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,459
I was 15 years I was awarded the first

39
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:11,609
mbaise European hacker being under 18

40
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,070
years old years old hackers has many

41
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,550
uses considered to be negative the

42
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:20,250
general definition of hackers such as

43
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:25,110
Linux Troy has this guy says that a

44
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,810
hacker is a person who uses a system in

45
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:32,070
a way for which this is no was not

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,620
thought of so the definition of

47
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,560
dissipation has a biggest scope we can

48
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,810
use them competing pirate many mass

49
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,540
media has to extrapolate this definition

50
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:47,550
to the typical guy who did with the I

51
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:50,519
fakes and animals hood by us touching

52
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,769
keys and buttons if you are but it makes

53
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,560
no sense because when an attacker at

54
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:57,600
home what's the point of creating a

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,440
anonymous but this created by us must

56
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:06,870
meet year the other companies i was like

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,209
vice president european commission in

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,190
our concern about cybersecurity there

59
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,290
are so strange things and decision don't

60
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,700
pay attention cookies presence cookies

61
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:19,798
how many of you are really bothered by

62
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,260
these cookies that the word that the rap

63
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,019
network is telling you i do you want to

64
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:29,130
store these cookies I'm bothered

65
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,530
by this so the Vice President of the

66
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:36,209
European Union dealing with the Digital

67
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:39,180
Agenda Nellie Nellie smart lady by the

68
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,970
time she was about 70 years old these

69
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,579
nearly these Nellie was updated with the

70
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,190
latest release his Nellie it has a big

71
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:52,739
responsibility he knew what she was

72
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:56,200
talking about there's an issue the trap

73
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,830
goes quicker than the rule

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,738
his true quick is allows you to track to

75
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,959
track down on but there are other brain

76
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:08,140
smart people who are giving a lot of

77
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,590
money with advertising ninety percent of

78
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:16,358
the revenue from google is not from

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:20,680
Andre door is Edward advertiser's

80
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:23,620
commercials I was like this these people

81
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,490
are giving me so much money and they're

82
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,970
about to learn how to do other citizens

83
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,250
there was so many ways to make it for

84
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:38,620
these cookies with other technologies so

85
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:42,220
the trap always goes quicker and the

86
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:46,810
rule of art William this vacation big

87
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,910
issue because people uses to sell the

88
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,250
merchants and you can control it a lot

89
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,169
of people use it for other purposes you

90
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,680
are familiar with national security

91
00:04:53,169 --> 00:05:00,219
agency NSA since there's no then we

92
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:03,400
build us what type of life way we're

93
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,280
getting through this is not them the

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,729
typical logo is an eagle with them

95
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,039
helmets spine everything this is not

96
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:15,610
their logo it's a promotional lower

97
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:18,789
created by the Electronic Frontier

98
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,280
Foundation devoted to protect you to

99
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:24,280
protect privacy and secrecy and they

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,650
keep supported free open-source preg is

101
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,309
true that is the best possible

102
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,820
description he is the ego is a

103
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:37,350
representative of DD the other values

104
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:42,039
and we're not at flags and we can see

105
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:45,580
all your data all your data and degree

106
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:49,030
is listening to this stage in a diabolic

107
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,080
like a d-mail way it has a demon face

108
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,479
behind

109
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,969
this logo it there is no air demon

110
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,169
behind your real computer but all that I

111
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:01,000
are getting through this as up today e

112
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,859
we cannot compare what we can do now

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,580
with the data compared to which is going

114
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,650
to have a next time big data presence

115
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,620
machine learning this is only the

116
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:13,419
beginning it's true that this is having

117
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,530
a pre pre Christian has been developed

118
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:20,349
over the past 40 years but it is true

119
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:26,469
this is going to have a lot of traction

120
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:28,479
I mean into the startup world and moving

121
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:31,780
from San Francisco to Madame vice versa

122
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,639
so the in intelligence in the artificial

123
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:38,340
intelligence is getting into the whole

124
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:40,840
thing many companies with doing research

125
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,409
artificial intelligence is a new trend

126
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:50,138
these new technology for every day cases

127
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:54,090
is amy amy is my secretary Amy does not

128
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:56,620
eat Amy does not sleep Amy doesn't need

129
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,679
absolutely and if they told any other

130
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:04,090
input from myself rather than my

131
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:06,610
calendar I poaching Amy on on coffee and

132
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:10,119
a mere speaks with everybody on that

133
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:13,690
email to coordinate the meet him how it

134
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,509
is possible big big data machine

135
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:20,979
learning which are if them if them fins

136
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:23,919
and in a bit of grammatical lesson this

137
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:26,229
all makes that when the robots receive

138
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,008
the emails they know who we are

139
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:34,120
referring to this technology has it use

140
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:36,069
and snow by anybody I don't need a real

141
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,520
human secretary you save money with

142
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:42,339
every every man but the real human

143
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:47,258
today's not do not like it so much but

144
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:49,300
but if it's used by the NSA many of

145
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:53,110
these noises are created by them what

146
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:56,680
would happen if what it can be exploited

147
00:07:53,110 --> 00:08:01,209
from our data is increased in the coming

148
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,360
years what happens if they break all our

149
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:05,270
encryption

150
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,340
which can happen in the time to come all

151
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:14,198
these secrets are revealed through IPS

152
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:19,609
encryption and decryption yesterday

153
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:21,800
yesterday a standard publish which says

154
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,530
that NSA cannot share a theoretical

155
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,090
speaking spy on you but we do know that

156
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:31,580
is not truth the we don't spend billions

157
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:36,348
and billions of dollars in big service

158
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:39,649
for nothing that's not true there's

159
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:43,099
another Orion issue which is this kind

160
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:46,970
of attackers attackers to which we are

161
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:52,070
in four directions we are paying this

162
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:54,820
attackers with our taxes people how the

163
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,329
NSA may have put a back door in our

164
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:01,070
essays cryptography a technical primer

165
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:04,640
prison from Cisco products which are the

166
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:08,209
leaders in the world and they publicly

167
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,060
many manifest what is screen with we're

168
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:13,910
going to keep NSA planted back doors in

169
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,800
Cisco products is like Theresa text

170
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,819
saying you I'm gonna send you over the

171
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:24,819
encryption and then we get reports that

172
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:28,970
playing MSS messages just by terrorists

173
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:32,959
they don't use even encryption you get

174
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:36,199
into all the encryption library to the

175
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,640
Crypt everything their petitions have no

176
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:43,099
idea at all about how things are working

177
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:46,279
there are more and more arguments and

178
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,420
tenants about this backdoors technically

179
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:52,910
open all the United USA president says I

180
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,670
wanted to wrap up with the encryption

181
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,339
you cannot finish and terminate an

182
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:00,349
algorithm that's impossible you get you

183
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:04,370
want to try you can try a prohibited

184
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,990
victim is not easy but otherwise you'd

185
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:11,250
have work

186
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:12,990
broken the whole world open SSL and NSA

187
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,500
back doors in crucial parts of operating

188
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:19,320
systems this is super super issue there

189
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,899
are solutions and applications that

190
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,730
someday allow us to be feared being

191
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:28,589
always a big depend in protector of

192
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:31,410
Linux little skips you so many tools

193
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:35,370
that allows you to protect your privacy

194
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:39,300
I don't only refer to tour Mac has also

195
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:41,820
super cool tool to severe speech which

196
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,130
is cyber prophecy all the inbounds and

197
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,610
at bound requests have to be authorized

198
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:52,140
this could be very bad we can create an

199
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:54,360
utter misery in rows to them mail server

200
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,370
but he had that something happens you

201
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,779
know what it's gonna be taurus is all

202
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:04,260
the time a pinging data into Google net

203
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:07,740
buyers what is net vias it's a service

204
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:11,240
updating the vials in remote control

205
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:15,420
that you don't have to be worried about

206
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:20,760
this kind problems totally dumped in

207
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:23,279
over your hard disk tour and face story

208
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:28,829
are you familiar with this how many of

209
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:32,689
you would use it knowing is good every

210
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:36,959
now and then and to create a networking

211
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:40,380
tour either think tour gives us the

212
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:44,819
power of recovering part of we have been

213
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:48,390
lost over this yes in security and

214
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:51,350
privacy and toward you can download it

215
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:55,140
as a browser in the similar way as

216
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:59,100
Firefox is based upon Firefox torque

217
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,560
connects to other huge amount of

218
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,079
computers online on this network and

219
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,279
your connections are routed through them

220
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,560
computers in such a way that the final

221
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,860
servicing the petition the request does

222
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,219
not know who you are this is is very

223
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,120
useful because we all know that our ISPs

224
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,700
is

225
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,560
is obviously we are revealing who we are

226
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,040
but with toward it's not impossible

227
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,560
because they did it take the silica road

228
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,069
creator the biggest port of selling

229
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:37,819
drugs weapons whatever online it was

230
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:40,589
free to use you she'll probably used to

231
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:43,650
bitcoins and he was caught up by the

232
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:47,779
players and he used tor he used the

233
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:51,930
hidden service store such as anonymous

234
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:55,520
battle inscribed by myself and and then

235
00:12:51,930 --> 00:13:00,839
American agencies spend a lot of money

236
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:03,510
in getting the the decryption of the

237
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,730
person behind second row it's not

238
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:09,240
perfect the more people use it the more

239
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,960
secures is separately is a fantastic

240
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,560
tool for the purpose of film producing

241
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:18,390
tales are you know are you familiar with

242
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,680
the Snowden did you see settlement city

243
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:27,180
citizen for the documentary is a

244
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:30,750
masterpiece snow them revealed so much

245
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,969
leaks to the press I this documentary

246
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:37,850
explains this very well to us is the

247
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:42,120
reality layer poitras this girl is

248
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:45,029
recording literally snow then when he is

249
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,730
first seen at the hotel super funny

250
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:52,140
because Snowden she's talking about then

251
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:56,610
she turns around in the room and picks

252
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:58,980
out the love online for the hotel they

253
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,890
could have been sniffing throughout this

254
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,650
man long form so this is a funny thing

255
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:08,360
chairs it's in operating system give

256
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,740
music recognition systems tales

257
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,270
appearances does not leave you track

258
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:17,160
short lose on USB in the computer you do

259
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:20,579
whatever you have to do you encrypted

260
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,949
information whichever and when you take

261
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:27,180
out the when you up like the USB it

262
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:29,550
eliminates all the round memory and this

263
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,439
little like you to do lectures

264
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:36,019
it's not indeed you can be more

265
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:39,029
anonymous down persons using your own

266
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:42,779
own encryption procedure which is the

267
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:47,100
next level not leaving traces another

268
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:48,510
two interesting options let's panky more

269
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,810
oriented to the general public and

270
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:57,510
domain which allows us to use pvp GPS

271
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,839
system it's it means been used a long

272
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:04,370
time pgp system allows us to have a set

273
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:08,070
of keys a public key and a private key

274
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:11,970
with this public key we can we can give

275
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:14,700
it to Pete port that can encrypt things

276
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:17,250
that became these decrypt with our

277
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,470
private ski this Vinick system for a

278
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:25,050
long time but the really key base is not

279
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:30,060
being induced but this mix of encryption

280
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:33,180
closer to the user when you see a green

281
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:37,410
bar is ok but the play is a side the

282
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:39,689
website and adding content against you

283
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,819
are doing the request knows what you're

284
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:45,209
doing if you see communication side to

285
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:48,839
side unlike with PDP we have an

286
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:52,739
encryption key Berenson allows you to

287
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:56,220
associate your PDP key with your social

288
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,260
identities everybody uses to chirping us

289
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,200
with this is associate in such a way

290
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:04,709
that is this exchange sup he is not that

291
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:08,850
complicated there's also strings and

292
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:11,279
funny how we can exchange pgp key with

293
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,260
one person so this is simple a place

294
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,930
with you guarantee you are yourself the

295
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:19,380
person enter then they see your pcp qian

296
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:23,819
period they have a super cool security

297
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:26,189
mode the web-based client can be hard

298
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,010
but there's also a command-line client

299
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:33,870
that you can use which is not user

300
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:37,290
friendly but i can use it kunia allows

301
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,870
me to encrypt things for the people

302
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,980
right by using their username which is

303
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:46,570
more funny user down

304
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:51,460
the other one or you can create create

305
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:55,330
your keeper in key base and is hosted by

306
00:16:51,460 --> 00:17:00,670
then encrypted with your password my

307
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:04,000
name is marked like with blockchain

308
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:06,940
technology behind the big coin

309
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,720
technology Bitcoin oh I like this this

310
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:15,460
currency and I will speak about you but

311
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,400
kind next minute like I said I am more

312
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:24,010
interested with the open-source back

313
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:26,830
doors you are open open SSL s library 3

314
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:29,560
an encryption platforms and the back

315
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:32,320
door is inside that some somebody has

316
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:37,179
put it is a super severe issue that one

317
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:41,020
in researching inscription so open open

318
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:44,440
open sores have back doors and good

319
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:46,470
at-bat advantages open source but we

320
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,580
don't have so many resources to

321
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:55,390
counteract against the disadvantages

322
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:57,730
medium-sized projects open source it's

323
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:01,380
very complicated that can be added no

324
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:05,380
audits are doing a massage prix

325
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:08,050
espionage issues related can put a back

326
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:11,770
door and it sound very well you don't

327
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:17,800
noticed there are chemicals as simple

328
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:20,020
bugs in the code no i am personally

329
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:26,080
interested in something I'm passionate

330
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:30,250
about this thing this big coil a Bitcoin

331
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,800
cuanto savage lokesh it going so how

332
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,950
many of you know Bitcoin how many of you

333
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,649
have two sips ever how many of you know

334
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:42,070
what block chain is well good number of

335
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:44,200
people and is not often they stand that

336
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,970
all right for those of you who are not

337
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,400
aware of it bitcoin is basically a

338
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,040
decentralized currency

339
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,310
and that means that there is no Bank of

340
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:01,139
regulator printing and controlling it

341
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:03,690
and actually it's the users who control

342
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,990
the nodes that is to say the nodes that

343
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:10,920
validate the intersections so therefore

344
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:14,370
that makes it fully anonymous it is not

345
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:18,540
anonymous by default and it does not

346
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:23,100
require any central regulating agency so

347
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:24,629
that opens up doors to freedom okay many

348
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:29,240
people thought that it was only reduced

349
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:33,690
to four drug drilling etc however now

350
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:36,090
well one percent of the transactions for

351
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:42,270
drug trafficking are carried housing

352
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:44,909
with bitcoins however but the other day

353
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,680
they reopened Union wanted to study you

354
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,770
know Bitcoin some of the relationship

355
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,110
with the terrorist attacks in France and

356
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:55,080
I'm sure the 99 percent of those people

357
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,729
choose dollars because ninety nine

358
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:03,090
percent of the things that happens in

359
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:06,810
the world of use dollars the currency so

360
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:10,199
I don't think that bitcoin is so much

361
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:12,330
widely used okay as to say and what is

362
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:16,020
most interesting about bitcoin is the

363
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:20,370
technology behind it so there is not a

364
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:22,620
great technological advanced it has

365
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:27,330
encryption a little less but in terms of

366
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:28,919
the game theory it's amazing so what I

367
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,889
mean is that incentives are aligned

368
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,370
correctly so that no one attacks the

369
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:37,860
network and no one makes that profitable

370
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:41,060
or worthwhile so I'll give you an

371
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:44,959
example monetary transactions have to be

372
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:49,080
recorded so in case an ordinary core

373
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,360
currency or standard currency so that

374
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,659
stress actions are registered in the

375
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,000
bank registry what happens with bitcoin

376
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,880
is that we have a network of computers

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,740
that contribute

378
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,049
computational power so that it is

379
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,429
centralized register that they all share

380
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:11,549
becomes unchanged so those computers

381
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:13,649
every 10 minutes agree on the status of

382
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:16,529
the network to go and say okay destro

383
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:19,889
section is valid okay it will go into a

384
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:26,399
block think about the notary register

385
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:30,480
page you know that money it is kind of

386
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:35,209
like that but decentralized so agreement

387
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:39,110
is reached Eddie 10 minutes and then

388
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:43,260
those computers make money from

389
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:46,129
resolving those mathematical issues so

390
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:52,110
let me give you an example all the

391
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:54,299
Bitcoin blocks well they tribute the

392
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:59,459
next block has the hash of the previous

393
00:21:54,299 --> 00:22:02,010
block ok so they want to prove that the

394
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,740
previous hands has changed and it is not

395
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,919
the same hash than the previous block

396
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,710
heart it also does proof of work that is

397
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,409
to say you apply computational power to

398
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,049
a mathematical program and that

399
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:18,450
mathematical problem has a level of

400
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:22,408
difficulty that changes so that at least

401
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:25,279
one of those with the computers resolves

402
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:28,200
it in at least 10 minutes so the

403
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:32,190
revolutionary side about this technology

404
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:34,620
is that it eliminate the need to forest

405
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,120
so because if we have a decentralized by

406
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,908
example we know that what happens is

407
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,059
true I'll give you a piece of

408
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:47,460
information to know what will happen on

409
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:48,750
the its access ian happening in bitcoin

410
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,779
you will have to spend like 10 million

411
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,549
euros yes to change one transaction

412
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:57,179
intersection so half a billion dollars

413
00:22:53,549 --> 00:23:01,520
which is not worthwhile so my startup is

414
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:04,250
a bit about that ok so

415
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,430
I'm not going to bore you more about

416
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,200
with VidCon so a theorem is basically

417
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,510
shows on the screen but is for

418
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,570
peer-to-peer computing two men have

419
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:17,080
applications being run being executed in

420
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:21,470
several notes and thrown out of results

421
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,720
so in the future we want i want

422
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:26,930
contracts to be executed automatically

423
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,570
for instance you may wait your bed so

424
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:32,690
it's and conditions that requires I've

425
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:37,070
met the money automatically sends out

426
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:40,460
the person who has won the bet and a

427
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:42,110
girl is exactly the same thing but for

428
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,140
provision markets and because it is

429
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:50,510
anonymous and decentralized may you may

430
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:52,910
have inside trading so you may go best

431
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,460
that tomorrow microsoft shares will

432
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:58,310
increase and someone may place a bet on

433
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:01,490
that and say i'm betting 1 million euros

434
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,710
is kind of predicting the future it is

435
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,510
fascinating it's fascinating because it

436
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,960
is anonymous and opens up these

437
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:12,110
possibilities and opportunities so this

438
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,570
is a takeaway message traditional

439
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:17,179
securities about centralized servers and

440
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:20,600
people working really hard to prevent

441
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:23,630
bugs from entering the system to make

442
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,790
this service impenetrable however in the

443
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,520
future everything will be much more

444
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,950
decentralized using game theory is about

445
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,790
aligning incentives in a correct manner

446
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:37,340
to have decentralized networks flawless

447
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:40,100
okay with no single point of failure of

448
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:41,810
course we are talking about Bitcoin it

449
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,419
is the most powerful network of

450
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:47,870
computers in the world ensuring that

451
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:49,820
that network is secure and for instance

452
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:54,080
that has connotation for security for

453
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:57,980
instance your database and you right

454
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,590
away notarized or certify your data base

455
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,980
so if an attacker breaks into your

456
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:06,439
database you may notice it you will

457
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,010
notice it so every time you modified you

458
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,920
there

459
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:12,770
do sign that modification but if an

460
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,480
attacker enters into your database you

461
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,220
will be able to know that that has

462
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,050
happened and you can go back to the

463
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:23,510
original status and my startup is about

464
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:28,310
that it's about notarizing on type of

465
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:30,500
data and it is a very exciting use for

466
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:34,090
security it's amazing what you can do in

467
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:36,830
terms of security do they need to trust

468
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:41,540
parties anymore you don't need trust

469
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:43,820
anymore you know also when someone has

470
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,520
changed dude data because internet data

471
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:50,510
digital data very easy to modify to

472
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,480
destroy to change however the what stays

473
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,310
in that database it's time fans they

474
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,770
have forever this is mind-blowing

475
00:25:55,310 --> 00:26:00,590
because incentives are aligned so that

476
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,080
those computers do not make any changes

477
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,840
as to what has happened in the last 10

478
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,460
minutes okay if only changing one of the

479
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,169
transaction costs you have a million

480
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:14,060
dollars in managing what happens and

481
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:17,060
because this is exponential so if you

482
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,010
are into security I would highly

483
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,500
recommend you to go right away into this

484
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:25,400
topic and if you have a curiosity for it

485
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:28,430
I will recommend you to the null Bitcoin

486
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:31,100
and to buy bitcoins it's a good time to

487
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:33,080
buy bitcoins now they are 300 they used

488
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,500
to be SAS and that was the best

489
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:41,300
investment in 2015 buying bitcoins no

490
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:45,020
well actually it was worth being and to

491
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:48,649
buy it to sell in 2014 because the value

492
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,660
went down and when it has a good future

493
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,240
ahead of it it is not that we reduce it

494
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:56,330
on a daily basis but now bats are kind

495
00:26:53,240 --> 00:27:00,260
of wanting kind of want to embrace it

496
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:02,629
into the system because it makes it more

497
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:07,460
we make things safer and it also

498
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:10,460
improves operability so it is the

499
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,310
database which is shared how well you

500
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,020
may publish whatever you want to make

501
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,649
publish on their hash you don't need to

502
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,230
publish

503
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,270
banking transaction and then you can go

504
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:22,160
with your heart chakra inside here this

505
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,530
is my dark interception and that has

506
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,200
that hash and that hash was in the

507
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:30,379
blockchain okay on the X date on the X

508
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,850
year and that's extremely interesting

509
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,280
and this is what we're doing stammering

510
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:38,120
and which is like my blowing in terms of

511
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,540
security so if you come up with any good

512
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:44,179
idea my name is mister Rowbotham bring

513
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,159
calm and I would like to get that email

514
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,100
a communication from you that's a great

515
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,930
technology because it centralizes

516
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,060
decentralizing makes things secure and

517
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:55,040
it gives back the freedom to the people

518
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,659
involved on participating and

519
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,310
interacting with the network so you

520
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,960
don't need to trust you don't need to

521
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:04,639
depend on a third party controlling

522
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,980
everything such as it's a case of states

523
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,210
some people are talking about

524
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,210
decentralizing states with that

525
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:13,910
technology has multiple applications and

526
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,070
at the end of the day make us move free

527
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:19,220
okay so security is all about that

528
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:21,320
making us freer than we are okay this

529
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:31,670
all for me and I'm happy to take any

530
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:39,200
questions that you may have how are you

531
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:40,580
doing I've rights I'd like to ask you

532
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,550
what do you think he should happen for

533
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,230
me bit country becomes mainstream and

534
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:50,530
you also say that our governments and

535
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:50,530
institutions want to support Bitcoin or

536
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:56,060
what happens with freedom if they were

537
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,490
to go into it so for it to be mainstream

538
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,340
you don't need anything now because out

539
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:03,410
of the sudden Bitcoin well and people in

540
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:08,750
general thought that it was just as

541
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:13,460
currency to buy prostitution weapons and

542
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:16,220
and drugs but now it is seen as a cool

543
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:20,120
technology and there is an American bank

544
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:21,560
who wants to interpret blockchain into

545
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:26,600
that okay at the end of the day

546
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:28,639
blockchain is Bitcoin so big block chain

547
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,580
is for certifying things is a

548
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:36,740
certification thing so mainstream is

549
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:40,699
already and as I said before we are not

550
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:43,070
going to pay with bitcoins tomorrow but

551
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:46,220
it would be like a backbone it will be

552
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:49,790
there operating behind us and making our

553
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,030
life easier and then when you told me

554
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:57,100
you asked me about countries yes the

555
00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:01,010
European Union is reviewing impact on

556
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,620
Bitcoin in the French terrorist attacks

557
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,850
which is like known okay because it

558
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,909
while communicating with each other

559
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:10,730
through SMS it so it's just a question

560
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:12,590
of time by the time thanks will embrace

561
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:15,020
it when integrated it would be

562
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:17,270
impossible for a state to say no because

563
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:20,510
at the end of the day we all know who

564
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:23,750
rules the world well if JPMorgan like a

565
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:25,970
huge bank and braces implemented it okay

566
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:28,580
that's it you know it will spread over

567
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,590
two governments so I'm quite optimistic

568
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,550
i never thought that this would go as

569
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:36,800
fast as it is going this is just crazy

570
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:41,720
bitcoin wasn't there well seven years

571
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:45,240
ago bitcoin was non-existent and well it

572
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:50,200
was the project of a person

573
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:53,620
that shows up with a millions from Japan

574
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,740
and now it is hot worldwide reputation

575
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,689
game theory is so good that's what makes

576
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,410
Bitcoin so good yeah I invite you to

577
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:05,919
read out the paper 14 pages it would

578
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:09,299
take a half an hour to read it but it is

579
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,260
highly recommended reading for any

580
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:14,110
morning laughs to know what you'll have

581
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,600
some free time it is mind-blowing like I

582
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:20,520
really wow these would change the world

583
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,520
and it is changing the world

584
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:43,100
okay question about bitcoins you set our

585
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:47,879
computers are running mathematical

586
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:51,000
programs okay but programs are jobs or

587
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,429
software well it is very easy well the

588
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,260
network agrees every sometime on a

589
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:58,530
difficulty difficulty it stands for a

590
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:05,129
number this is like a fresh code proof

591
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:07,620
of work is kind of showing that you have

592
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:11,220
contributed computational power to a

593
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:13,739
problem so in this case they make hashes

594
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,520
okay they have a number and they have to

595
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,559
convert or transform that hash that has

596
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,830
to be computed all the time they have to

597
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,299
be converted into a numerical serious

598
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,610
and then if the number is below the

599
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:28,500
threshold it is validated and if it is

600
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:31,799
above the high school the network does

601
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,919
not validate it well if you know about

602
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,539
hashing you wouldn't find out that you

603
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,059
can imagine that that is very

604
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:41,970
complicated when the knee with a hash if

605
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:45,990
you convert it to an integer it should

606
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:48,840
be below the threshold and that's

607
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,510
basically about it and proof of work has

608
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,678
very many utilities and capacities were

609
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:57,840
for security for disability so if an

610
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,970
attacker doesn't find it profitable to

611
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,799
attack you because it has to use lots of

612
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,679
computational power for the money that

613
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:06,750
he will get out of it if you will not do

614
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,919
it okay so that's mind-blowing in terms

615
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,919
of security as well

616
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:28,940
I have two questions so what is the size

617
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:31,520
of blockchain now my plan you what the

618
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,930
maximum number of bitcoins that is

619
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:38,450
allowed 21 million well actually we are

620
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:42,560
talking about 40 60 gigabytes for the

621
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:46,430
blockchain it continues to grow the

622
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:48,350
thing is that it should continue to keep

623
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:51,110
its small size because it is

624
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:54,830
decentralized you know I maybe my

625
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:59,649
computer I may have a Bitcoin chains and

626
00:33:54,830 --> 00:34:02,540
running operating if it grows a lot if

627
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:04,670
you will need a supercomputer to have it

628
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,310
okay there for for it will become

629
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:10,159
centralized there are proposals for it

630
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:12,469
to feed it oh no to increase the size of

631
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,270
the block so that more transactions can

632
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:16,580
be carried out because we are reaching

633
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:17,780
up to the maximum number of transactions

634
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,480
but at the end of the days that

635
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:24,380
centralizes the network if only you can

636
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,560
have super if you you can only use like

637
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,990
super computers then you will end up

638
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:32,719
centralizing it but this is synchronized

639
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:34,939
okay so 60 gigabytes okay and the other

640
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,270
question is 20 million 20 million

641
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:40,790
bitcoins by default to be honest if more

642
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:44,030
than thirty one percent of them VidCon

643
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:46,219
network address on changing whatever for

644
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:50,510
instance instead of 21 million they make

645
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:54,129
it I don't know 48 the limit will become

646
00:34:50,510 --> 00:35:00,820
48 so this is like huge democracy

647
00:34:54,130 --> 00:35:03,400
bitcoin is like a massive democracy so

648
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:05,590
so I wouldn't go into macroeconomics

649
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:09,190
because i'm sure that economies know

650
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:13,410
much more than me of course but roughly

651
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:17,950
speaking the money that we have now

652
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:19,480
every so often gets devalued however the

653
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,669
opposite happens with Bitcoin because

654
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,260
there are only 20 1,000,000 and there

655
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,240
are more and more because being

656
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,580
generated bitcoins are being generated

657
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,009
whenever problem resources mathematical

658
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,920
problem as a reward because it has

659
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:37,300
contributed computational power to make

660
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:41,320
the network sefa of MU secure so we are

661
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:45,490
at 12 million now so it is one way to

662
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,830
keep it limited and for its value to go

663
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,560
up and this is what weeds it's

664
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:54,040
interesting to keep the network security

665
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,029
secur this is kind of this is a theory I

666
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,190
don't know where they are the

667
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:59,380
implications as a macroeconomic level

668
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,510
there are studies and papers proving

669
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,570
that it's positive and negative but

670
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:08,260
anyway it is very very very well thought

671
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:13,990
and very very well designed hello good

672
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:19,270
afternoon wrists my question is whether

673
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:21,910
this inspires in system mmm Betty which

674
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:26,620
is like a neuronal and network of

675
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:29,080
computers with the most is exploded from

676
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:32,080
each computer in that sense yes it is

677
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,390
like that it is about tapping or using

678
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:39,430
exploding the competition and power

679
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:41,350
however SETI is like a freak out things

680
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:43,509
which is like really cool okay you

681
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:46,360
participate in me but in bit going to

682
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:48,970
have a clear incentive to make money if

683
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,520
you make bitcoins and you can sell your

684
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:55,600
bitcoins for three hundred dollars you

685
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,490
can make money you make money yes sent

686
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,410
it's okay because there is a network of

687
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:02,169
people contributing the competition

688
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:04,450
network part in the case of bitcoins

689
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,730
every sexier incentive okay it's

690
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,899
something to make money which is also

691
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,960
part of the

692
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:13,779
general or overview or mindset of these

693
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,240
the geniuses the geniuses behind it

694
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:18,579
again they have also aligned the

695
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:28,828
objectives again that's where the genius

696
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:33,789
lies my questions are about concerns

697
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:42,099
first concern pub will happen with an

698
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:45,670
event kind of Black Swan something so

699
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:46,829
because the Creator is anonymous but we

700
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:50,589
don't know whether there will be any

701
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:53,500
vested interests behind that i very much

702
00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:59,970
believe in decentralized networks they

703
00:37:53,500 --> 00:38:04,210
offer good opportunities but they also

704
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:07,118
remove or take away the opportunity for

705
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:09,039
yourself to be to be yourself it will

706
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,829
have the system which is being fully

707
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:16,390
decentralized well whether we'll talk

708
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:18,190
about services or computational power so

709
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,618
we have removing the power from the

710
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:24,970
lobbies from the big groups that

711
00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:28,539
currently hold the power however however

712
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:38,078
we are directing that for in that to

713
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:40,660
kind of something which is big imagining

714
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,750
but that would also be like a free state

715
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:47,200
but it was so eliminate our science of

716
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:50,579
identity what happens in the case of yes

717
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:55,299
black from events if it were to happen

718
00:38:50,579 --> 00:39:00,539
so very broad questions that we try to

719
00:38:55,299 --> 00:39:00,538
be as short as possible in my answer

720
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:09,210
so sad to see have good number of

721
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:12,990
bitcoins okay because it was the first

722
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:15,870
one to do the mining okay he's got quite

723
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:20,700
a lot of them and he hasn't moved them

724
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:25,109
it is Satoshi were to move his all his

725
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:27,359
bit consumer he will just sync but he

726
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:33,690
will recover having a centralized

727
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:36,530
database has more than economic power so

728
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:41,510
regarding the mattress state some

729
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:45,150
projects are very interesting if you

730
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:48,440
google if you type in the centralized

731
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:50,970
big cone and nature's if you have

732
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,730
internet and Bitcoin you can communicate

733
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,459
information from one part of the world

734
00:39:53,730 --> 00:40:00,300
to another without going through state

735
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,310
without the need for state so we are at

736
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:08,040
the time when mana police have been

737
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:10,310
removed so PMD when everyone reduce it

738
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:15,590
in the world will become a monopoly

739
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:18,540
balance is after the same over some time

740
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:21,360
travel RB will be decentralized and

741
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:24,420
there would be no one executing the

742
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,270
service in a centralized manner at the

743
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,490
end of the day of the centralized

744
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:32,130
networks are decentralized okay and

745
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:36,620
that's the most receipt somehow and then

746
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,620
you may go and say whether nvidia Intel

747
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:45,509
with the largest computational power may

748
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:48,120
end up owning and controlling 51% of the

749
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:51,510
network probably the never will exclude

750
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:57,750
them from it because they will classify

751
00:40:51,510 --> 00:41:00,300
them as the evil people okay or well my

752
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,130
answer is I don't know if I knew the

753
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,440
answer I will be God but still very

754
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:09,650
interesting times are ahead of us and

755
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,650
especially 10 years from now

756
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,740
hello

757
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:21,680
when you said that fans will implement

758
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:24,680
block chain in the networks as far as I

759
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,799
know that we implement block chain for

760
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:30,319
the for the currencies okay for the

761
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:32,630
currency that standard currency the

762
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,460
mainstream one that we all use but will

763
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:42,019
be the impact on Bitcoin in terms of the

764
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:44,680
use of it and wouldn't it be also an

765
00:41:42,019 --> 00:41:48,109
opportunity to strengthen to enhance

766
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:53,058
standard currencies vessels Bitcoin oh

767
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:57,769
yes to have heat and you have hit the

768
00:41:53,059 --> 00:42:02,210
nail on the head yes okay they will be

769
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:04,308
using layers layers that are shared by

770
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:06,109
all the banksy with no longer happen

771
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:07,970
what happened in two thousand April

772
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:10,430
thanks i started to distract each other

773
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:13,459
and then the system blew up yes the

774
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:16,220
blockchain could fix the or improve the

775
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:19,220
current banking system that should not

776
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:24,410
be a concern having a peer-to-peer and

777
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:28,399
such a secure website and that is

778
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:32,480
decentralized is just like winning big

779
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,519
big game and other people will end up in

780
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,710
using Bitcoin or not they will do it

781
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:38,419
however it's a question of times a

782
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:41,420
question of maturity people have to be

783
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:44,089
ready versus in the US I was the other

784
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,640
day I was Center oh I got the credit

785
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:49,160
cards of my company and they said that

786
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,400
pin was a great innovation pin number

787
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:55,578
was a great innovation and in Spain for

788
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,980
instance I don't know in on buzz you

789
00:42:55,579 --> 00:43:02,539
cannot really change pay with your

790
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:05,630
credit cards things are going slowly but

791
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:06,920
in some tears time but design people

792
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,160
would realize that you don't need to

793
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:12,500
centralize anything to do things okay

794
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:15,259
bitcoin will be just explode with just

795
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,000
be really really mind-blowing or would

796
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:20,029
be a great revolution i think it would

797
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:28,589
take less than five years just

798
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:31,609
by cultures any other questions all

799
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:31,609
right thank you very much
