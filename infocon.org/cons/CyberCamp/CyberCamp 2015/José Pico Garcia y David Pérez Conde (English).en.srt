on yours dedicado plane Ahmet ok and he

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,359
has been working in advanced security

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,849
services for 10 years now he's got a

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,920
degree in telecommunication he has

10
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,370
written books and he has given training

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,350
on cybersecurity and he's one of the few

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,680
professionals Cuzco did Jack security

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,280
experts certificates and we also have

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,170
Javier Perez Garcia he's an IT expert 18

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,840
years of experience in ID technology

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,199
together with David they found it I

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,649
Jackie in the year 2013 when they

18
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,608
develop highly technical security

19
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,440
services and training so hello good

20
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,390
morning to all of you how are you doing

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,360
this morning but we do will tell us

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,060
about today well thank you very much and

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:14,010
we're it's a pleasure to be with you

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,950
today we will be discussing 3g well 2g

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,100
we know for a long time now that it is

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,710
highly vulnerable 3g is a slightly

27
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,350
better than 2g but is still there are

28
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,189
some vulnerabilities and we'd like to

29
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,130
share that with you well mobiles have

30
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,408
two sides to them okay they have an OS

31
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,520
that you need to be protected but then

32
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,500
the second part is about communication

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,869
communication from mobile phones ok

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,170
yesterday we want to be the skirt and

35
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,450
frightened about mobile phones computers

36
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,299
laptops and yesterday we also heard

37
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,970
about the possibility of hacking cars ok

38
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:58,159
we do be frightening as well today or

39
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,658
not oh you will be just when selling us

40
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,200
training as well do you have to be

41
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,329
really aware of the risks ok it's not a

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,789
question of getting afraid of it and not

43
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,709
using technology but just being aware

44
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,410
being aware and use

45
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,270
technology Wesley okay and well I always

46
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,280
give this an example you go to an ATM

47
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,380
and they tend to be kind of dangerous

48
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,720
but okay you just don't get your money

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,910
and then you just wave it and show it to

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,440
everyone okay you have to be careful we

51
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,049
have to use technology you have to be

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,150
aware of the risks and that's as much as

53
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,450
you need to do okay for those of you who

54
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,210
are not only hear the LG tarian so we

55
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,799
have a box here and we can encourage you

56
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,320
to come over here they told us that

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,870
there is something in that box and if

58
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,140
that thing would not be in that box that

59
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:49,680
they will be illegal so I would kindly

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,420
ask you to come into this auditorium so

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,570
that you find out about what's in that

62
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,420
box and what you can do with it could

63
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,640
you please anticipate something for us

64
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,130
oh yes that's the father died box all

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,829
the electromagnetic radiation that is

66
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,210
the immediate doesn't come out now what

67
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,500
do we do that well because the

68
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:12,090
frequencies that are used for mobile

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:15,300
telephony a half proprietor so we kind

70
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,310
of really Amit Amit those frequency not

71
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,170
in the opening in space and if we do

72
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:25,560
that we will be replacing a movie star

73
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,059
or any telecom operators so we are not

74
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,980
know yours but we believe that if we

75
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,080
were to do so that will be illegal and

76
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,140
then everything that will happen over

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,210
there will be just generating a number

78
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,100
of flows in the mobile phones of the

79
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:41,220
audience and that's why we will be doing

80
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,500
everything in there in that box ok we

81
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,600
can rest assured everything in the box

82
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,660
no problems with the mobile phones of

83
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,730
the audience ok and well we are here

84
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,680
anyone who would like to come they are

85
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,869
very very welcome ok so do you have the

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,860
floor good morning everyone my name is

87
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,860
David he is how set

88
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:16,459
okay we are colleagues and we live and

89
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:21,199
working Valencia we founded our company

90
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:24,889
logic as you can read on the screen so

91
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:29,000
we do technical security services and we

92
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:31,250
also do security research for instance

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,580
we have researched communication of

94
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:37,370
moment of mobile telephony we were

95
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,289
passionate for it and we believe that is

96
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,800
very important because we are all the

97
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:50,810
time interacting with the telephony now

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:54,919
SiC G is being tested ok so today we are

99
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:58,789
here to share through you 3g with you we

100
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:01,849
know that chewy is it is very vulnerable

101
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:04,400
well be tog raphy that is being used is

102
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:06,919
broken with and without cryptography you

103
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,719
can do many things you can do intercept

104
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:13,789
ation you can listen to the traffic

105
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:18,050
whether it is been encrypted or not you

106
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:22,669
can listen to GPRS data everything you

107
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:27,199
can manipulate those data well we tell

108
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:29,510
you what false base attack is about so

109
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,340
you can be in between the communication

110
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,479
of the victims so everything that is

111
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,750
sent out to the network can be

112
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,990
manipulated and otherwise so you can

113
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:43,220
also do users identification each sim

114
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:46,460
card has sick code has an ID we refer to

115
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,490
it it is a unique heidi code for that

116
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,070
sim card so if anyone could see the

117
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,789
unique identifiers of those sim card

118
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:58,280
stable they could know who is in here ok

119
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:00,740
you can do that in 2g and we know that

120
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,539
for we've known that for a long time

121
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:09,050
geolocation once to detect

122
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,420
a smartphone that you really want to

123
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,150
know exactly what it is you may know

124
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:17,540
that it is around but how you may want

125
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,909
to know which specific home that mobile

126
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,600
phone is you can do it you can do it

127
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:26,660
perfectly arrives in 2g and then denial

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,360
of service in mobile communication any

129
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:33,350
wireless communication is always

130
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,960
acceptable or prone to have denial of

131
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,930
service you can do it through jammers or

132
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,729
through signup inhibitors they generate

133
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,370
lots of noise and then you cannot really

134
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,920
tell the sign all apart from the noise

135
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,400
and then you can do denial of service

136
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,800
that's one way to do it in Wi-Fi but

137
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,679
there are other ways to do in very many

138
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,770
ways to do the Nile of service and as I

139
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,580
saying all that about Gigi has been

140
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:04,340
known for a long time now and and an

141
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,520
attacker to do that perhaps many years

142
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:11,060
ago meet it hi investment to do so

143
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,969
however now you can do all that with

144
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,440
hard way which is a thousand euros so

145
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,440
you have everything that you need

146
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,400
gadgets that you may buy on ebay on the

147
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,480
internet with a very low cost you can do

148
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,479
all those attacks

149
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:31,909
so the attacks we are discussing today

150
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,650
but today we will be talking about it

151
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,140
classical attacks the false based

152
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,390
attacks they have been there for a long

153
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,479
time because in 2g you can do a full

154
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:46,080
attack and that is simple thing to do

155
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:51,000
where you can do attacks in telephony or

156
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:54,479
using false telephones but today we will

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,910
talk about only false based attacks okay

158
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,610
we really start by summarizing and

159
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:03,000
giving you an overview about them so

160
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,460
this type of attack we have an attacker

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,880
that simulates or pretends to be the

162
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:12,090
telecom operator orange movie star etc

163
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,420
actually the operator is not relevant

164
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:18,659
the attacker can pretend that he is man

165
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:20,970
of the widgets operators in the country

166
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,650
and what does the attacker has to do to

167
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,800
pretend that he is the operator well

168
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:29,549
first of all he has to locate itself in

169
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,010
a position or in a location close to the

170
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,870
potential victim if I want to attack you

171
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,760
I am in the right position why is that

172
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:44,010
so because the base station that i will

173
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:46,380
be using has limited scope okay limited

174
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,490
strength okay so i have to locate myself

175
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,140
in the best location to attack my victim

176
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,930
once i'm in that location what do i need

177
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:59,699
to do well as a result problem have to

178
00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:03,060
configure my cell so that the victim my

179
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:07,260
victims telephone registers itself in

180
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:10,290
that cell and if i don't do that i may

181
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,350
be emitting a signal but if i don't

182
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:17,240
configure myself fradley the victim will

183
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:20,790
never register his phone against myself

184
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:23,610
myself okay so we are emitting like if

185
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,640
we were a false cell that is to say a

186
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:29,340
cell that does not exist because we want

187
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,160
the attacker to register itself for

188
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,970
himself against ourselves and when that

189
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,579
happened

190
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,730
okay we refer to it as camping camping

191
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:42,719
in our cells when that happens the 2g

192
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:45,740
communication of the victim become and

193
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,660
go under the control of the attacker

194
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,959
full control so what does that mean we

195
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,790
can manipulate that we can denial to

196
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,989
denial of service we can redirect

197
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,660
communications we are talking about data

198
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:06,300
and voice here any type of communication

199
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:10,170
and as we are saying well this is well

200
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:14,279
known other researchers as well as us

201
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:24,050
having given presentations about that

202
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:24,050
within black heart black hat all right

203
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:39,809
okay right so intestines intercept ation

204
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:42,329
manipulation we think representations

205
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:45,050
how about how you can do those attacks

206
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:47,729
okay with k presentation scenes trust

207
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:55,319
conferences and talks okay all these is

208
00:10:47,730 --> 00:11:00,449
for 2g however for when it comes to 3g

209
00:10:55,319 --> 00:11:02,250
can we also do these false waste attacks

210
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,109
as well well initially in the beginning

211
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:08,870
we thought that it was not possible to

212
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,870
do it because we thought

213
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:19,790
that when that was designed for 2g so it

214
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,760
was needed to have the authentication of

215
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,530
the mobile phone against the network

216
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,140
because the operator needed to know who

217
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,720
was making the call just to charge for

218
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:33,290
that kool however in the standard they

219
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,360
did not include just the opposite that

220
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,510
is to say that the moment had to prove

221
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,300
to the hard to prove that the network

222
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,490
had to prove the identity not only the

223
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,650
mobile phone so it is very easy to set

224
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,840
up a station to say that you are movie

225
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,520
star and then the mobile phone will

226
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,100
believe it because the mobile phone

227
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,579
doesn't have a way to check whether that

228
00:11:52,100 --> 00:12:00,940
is true or not however in 3g when they

229
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:04,070
decided 3g they added a two-way

230
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:07,070
authentication so both the mobile phone

231
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:11,710
and the network me to prove to each

232
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:16,130
other who or that they are there at

233
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:19,730
identification and then the ciphering or

234
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,140
cryptography of 2g is broken okay that

235
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:26,770
is to say that someone has gotten the

236
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:30,890
key to decipher amo decrypt

237
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:33,260
communications but in 3g cryptography

238
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,710
has not been broken if something is

239
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:39,410
encrypted you cannot really do any

240
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,930
tricks in there so with those two things

241
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:46,219
that is to say to white authentication

242
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:50,209
and a non broken encryption can we still

243
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,100
do a false base attack of wealth and you

244
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,260
may think that you cannot do it but if

245
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,950
you read this standard the norm

246
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:01,170
carefully we notice that most of the

247
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:05,550
messages are encrypted

248
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:10,469
but not all of them so does that are not

249
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:13,079
encrypted so we looked at the scenes

250
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:16,980
that we were doing in 2g that would be

251
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:21,029
taken over to 3g and then in 2013 are

252
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,149
the rigid we gave a presentation we said

253
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:26,189
that is a catchy which is users

254
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:29,639
identification could also be done in 3g

255
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:32,639
geolocation you could also with the

256
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:37,410
tabula rasa do it denial of service or

257
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:41,100
jamming that also works and we could see

258
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:45,660
that it was also feasible in theory for

259
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:49,019
3g and then also setting to a mobile

260
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:53,910
phone ok instead of talking 3g now

261
00:13:49,019 --> 00:14:00,510
please change to yourself and go to this

262
00:13:53,910 --> 00:14:03,779
false self into g that i have here ready

263
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:06,899
for you and then we said ok all that is

264
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:09,750
possible for 3g however at that time we

265
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:13,860
didn't have this hardware or software or

266
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:17,910
the time to do the testing and this is

267
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,730
what we will be showing you today and as

268
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:23,610
we were saying today the first problem

269
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,730
that the attacker has to resolve is to

270
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:30,360
determine how to configure his cell and

271
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:34,279
before we do that let us go through how

272
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:37,170
mobile phones decide which cell to

273
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,180
connect with well mobile phone is not

274
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,490
only time is scanning the radiographic a

275
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,279
spectrum to determine which is the best

276
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:48,540
one ok they do not do it because we will

277
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:50,970
take up lots of battery and time hand

278
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,610
CPU once a mobile phone is in the cell

279
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,810
before decides whether to change another

280
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:56,810
seller not get

281
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:03,089
sign up message that he gets from the

282
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,269
cells and says monitor these cells

283
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:09,089
monitor the cells that are around you

284
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:12,620
then mobile phone does that and measures

285
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:16,860
the power of those cells it measures the

286
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:19,649
power of the cells then the tower tells

287
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:22,019
him to monitor and what does the mobile

288
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:25,050
phone does well then does the ranking

289
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,810
and says okay first second third sale so

290
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:31,740
when the Fed cell of the ranking has a

291
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:33,750
higher signing or stronger talent that

292
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,540
it's ainol that i'm getting i will

293
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,269
switched on to that cell this is quite

294
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:42,060
simple all mobile phones do that and

295
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:45,720
some mobile phones have an engineering

296
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:48,089
module implementing that so this is the

297
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,980
Sampson that I have and now I like to

298
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,850
share with you that ranking that I just

299
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:57,689
mentioned again I'll show you the camera

300
00:15:52,850 --> 00:16:01,680
okay hi I start the camera now all right

301
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:05,189
d camera is in the cell will show you

302
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:10,378
the infrastructure later on ok this is

303
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:13,490
ok to not close it this is the ranking

304
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:16,290
of cells that the mobile phone is sing

305
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,300
its ranking the cells and it says number

306
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:23,099
one number two number said this is

307
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:27,120
dynamic this is online and this is how

308
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,730
mobile phones work all the time did I

309
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,329
understand myself did I make myself

310
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:35,490
clear did you all get it have right so

311
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:37,589
what is that for well one of the things

312
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:41,100
that will have to do in our phone cell

313
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:44,670
is the frequency in which we will be a

314
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,889
meaning so in 2g knowing the frequency

315
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:50,430
is very important because as you can see

316
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:54,300
here there is a range of frequencies any

317
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:57,029
of these could be of interest to us and

318
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:02,219
then choosing the frequencies importance

319
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:04,109
ok ha bhava in 3g well we could also

320
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,530
have overlapping frequency but in

321
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,939
practice in 3g each operator uses two or

322
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,730
three frequencies

323
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,730
so therefore basically we could say that

324
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,470
each of these frequency because

325
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:20,280
frequencies could be good for us however

326
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:23,430
in 3g thank you to mathematics and also

327
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,220
canal codes well several cells could

328
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:28,830
emit in the same frequency that is to

329
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,920
say overlapping in the same frequency so

330
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,770
therefore we have to be aware of the

331
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,320
code so that's the primary scanning one

332
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,420
and we need to know that towed because

333
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,950
these are the two main parameters for us

334
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:46,590
to configure our false cell and where do

335
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,750
we get that information from well the

336
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,419
ideal solution would be to have a nice

337
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,600
knife Alice neither listening to all the

338
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:57,210
traffic so that the traffic that is not

339
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,810
encrypted could be listened we did that

340
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:03,690
in 2014 we came to the modem or router

341
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:07,740
part it's a hard work and we it is in

342
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:11,850
progress we are working on it so we do

343
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,830
it when we do it cut off it's kind of a

344
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:16,620
hobby for us ok we are working on it and

345
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:20,070
we don't know when we will finish and

346
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,770
what is the alternative solution so we

347
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,840
don't want to talk about work around ok

348
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,600
we prefer to say alternative solution

349
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,480
alternative solution is getting a mobile

350
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,270
phone and to its tractor information we

351
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,610
will be using the messages that this my

352
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:42,260
phone only this mobile phone x.x

353
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:47,909
changing with the cell so those messages

354
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:50,040
go to the cell ok that's the ex-con true

355
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,140
and then it says I have identified this

356
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,230
message I did not identify this message

357
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:58,800
so all these messages are being

358
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:03,450
transferred onto white Zac so white

359
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:08,158
shark again this

360
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:10,409
for you to see well d some activity in

361
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:15,019
this mobile phone ok let us go to Google

362
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:17,789
let us do some search engine you know

363
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:20,190
just let us do a search and here these

364
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:23,639
are the control messages that we see in

365
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:27,299
that fight shock and what did we do to

366
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:29,399
get that information well instead of

367
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:34,580
doing that manually and distracted from

368
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:34,580
white shark we just did parser

369
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:47,420
so when we do it online oks subway we

370
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:52,929
will be showing now the initial cell

371
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:56,240
takes some time for us to get to it okay

372
00:19:52,929 --> 00:20:02,510
so engineering mo tells us about the

373
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:04,809
frequency XL decimal mode again give me

374
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,809
a sec

375
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:28,929
okay I needed to hatch include the

376
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,420
function so this is what we are doing

377
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,370
online well we are getting messages okay

378
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:38,020
these messages are taking some time to

379
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:40,149
get to us each dot is a message we are

380
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,370
parsing it and we are transforming it

381
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:45,160
into the type of information that we

382
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,560
want we will be doing that quick so that

383
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,530
we do not lose any time soon and these

384
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,780
are the results of that characterization

385
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:56,590
these are the active cells of our mobile

386
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:59,590
phone and these are the cells candidates

387
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:05,470
candidate cells to be in full cells

388
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:07,600
false cells well we don't want to use

389
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:11,890
these ones because they are being just

390
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,649
these are and induced these are being

391
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:18,010
juiced so therefore we want to use the

392
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:20,890
cell which is not being used okay so

393
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:24,040
half an hour before we started this

394
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,620
precipitation we configured our full

395
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,690
self with one of these values we could

396
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:35,370
also do that online we could stop that

397
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:41,610
capture we could save it in a file and

398
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:41,610
we could use our parcel our program and

399
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:51,030
information is extracted from that file

400
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,430
the information that is distracted is

401
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:59,680
much more comprehensive okay because it

402
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:02,700
has been doing so before before even we

403
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:07,230
started the presentation ok this is the

404
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:11,920
alternative solution how about how to

405
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:15,400
configure the fall cell so that mobile

406
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,980
phone tries to connect to our cell and

407
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,940
what do we need what do we need for that

408
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:24,460
Thunder for this paper principles to

409
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,160
cheer tad with a very simple app let's

410
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:31,450
say we can do it ourselves to do with

411
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:34,390
three team let's show ash is the the the

412
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:38,770
mounted we're seeing out stage listed we

413
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:42,280
need a pc with the software's MTC we

414
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:46,330
also need some specific hardware which

415
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:50,139
is a well-defined radius software which

416
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:52,120
is a device that sends out signals and

417
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,400
receptive signals all the processing of

418
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:59,800
signals is done by the bc you are

419
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:04,950
connected on software we use them USB

420
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:09,700
tooth up 200 and with the pc with this

421
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:15,420
well ready defined by software radio we

422
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:20,230
can do all this we also used is this a

423
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:23,500
far dive box will sit in detail as we

424
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:27,010
said before if we send out this signal

425
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,930
into the air will be infringing enters

426
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:32,950
passing the law but the attackers own

427
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:35,830
don't care about trespassing laws but we

428
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:39,400
have been commanded we are not going to

429
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,889
jail we are good guys especially when in

430
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,350
front of you on the spot light no no

431
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,720
that's not good stuff this part I box

432
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,149
and there's no radiation getting into

433
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,280
this box everything inside happens

434
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,340
inside period we are not sent out

435
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,460
sending out signals into the space so

436
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,300
let's put it in a very first spot on on

437
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:03,940
screen this is a very normal p seem that

438
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:09,460
it's useful for presentations this is

439
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:11,890
abnormal pc with linux and the opt for g

440
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,340
software it's very simple a lot of no

441
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:18,390
secrets at all nothing behind the USB is

442
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:23,520
connected with this device which is the

443
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:28,180
urs p200 a radio frequency of where

444
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,700
defiance fan and this sends out and

445
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:34,270
receive signals through these connectors

446
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,490
over here which are oddly the exits into

447
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,408
the antenna two antennas connected

448
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:42,859
undies

449
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:46,639
outlets and we have connected some wires

450
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:48,320
coming into this side the panel in of

451
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:52,459
the box and such a way they are

452
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,979
connected and inside we can see the two

453
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,239
antennas connect is inside the two

454
00:24:54,979 --> 00:25:01,700
antennas connect it and here we can see

455
00:24:58,239 --> 00:25:05,899
the victim of foam well fine and the

456
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:09,679
middle here we go and do to operate this

457
00:25:05,899 --> 00:25:11,748
is like like an incubator you lock the

458
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,139
incubator it's totally isolated to

459
00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:19,419
operate inside you got some crystal and

460
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:22,789
some gloves very simply this incubator

461
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:25,369
let's see it's really incubated we

462
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:30,229
needed gloves and we can check out we

463
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:34,158
can manipulate the mobile as that the

464
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:37,219
cage is totally closed and shut down as

465
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,649
we said this is to do so in a legal away

466
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:43,519
in accordance with the law we want to

467
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:45,768
avoid the legal issues in reality with

468
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:52,849
two simple antennas well connected with

469
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:55,570
this would be festival so far so good so

470
00:25:52,849 --> 00:26:01,700
let's now proceed with the very first

471
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:05,539
attack on 3g in a live show very simply

472
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:08,029
is a very inception in the catching

473
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:11,239
attack on 3g happy number many years now

474
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:15,859
and we need to know in our already

475
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:20,929
electric space our outreach surrounding

476
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:22,519
a spectrum as an insidious and identify

477
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:27,049
an identifier given to you by the

478
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:29,779
operator on yours s i am car MC is

479
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:32,629
associated with your sim card so this

480
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:34,940
prepaid card associated with the idea

481
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:37,519
that in most of the characters the MC

482
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,909
identifies you as a person for this race

483
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:42,379
so the MC Kachin is considered to be

484
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:43,210
sensitive information because the

485
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:44,830
Germans

486
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:49,510
you have if you are or have been you're

487
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:51,699
in the various places at certain moment

488
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:54,700
in time several so if you're precisely

489
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,529
here as of today on this sport I check

490
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,210
out if you are in on these disparities

491
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:00,880
that can attack you so this is very

492
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,539
sensitive information you we extract the

493
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,940
info from one or several a mobile phones

494
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:10,840
with either within the radio legged

495
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:15,549
space which is now inside the far die

496
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:19,840
cage so far so good so we should chop

497
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:23,350
these we can stop this and now like I

498
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:28,029
said we're going to extract basically in

499
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:33,459
this bass stays station we can see this

500
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:35,590
is the external primary code appearing

501
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:39,130
on the possible list of candidates which

502
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:41,949
is something randomly this code belongs

503
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:45,970
to the country's operator or cancers are

504
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:50,740
given the 07 movie star operator /

505
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:55,330
countries so this does not depend on the

506
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:58,419
operator this is the band one of the

507
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:03,730
neighboring cells reporting by the

508
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:10,990
mobile phone on the nine hundred and one

509
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:14,649
of the very few cells use for volume so

510
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:19,240
this configuration this software is as

511
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:24,459
marvelous the 3g radio stations always

512
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:27,750
super cool if it becomes a problem we

513
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:31,900
restarted so with very simple commands

514
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:35,180
we switch on the radio

515
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,970
quit man this is the driver from the

516
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:40,570
radio station and we're going to start

517
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:45,560
to signal out with this configuration

518
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:49,850
this mal phone is in service yes let's

519
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:53,990
check it out we see is reporting 3d so

520
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:57,290
then it has a legitimate so phone

521
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:00,320
service we're going to close the cage

522
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:04,220
and the phone will stop receiving the

523
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,530
legitimist signal if the attack is

524
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:09,170
configuring the default Space Station

525
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:11,840
can work on actor and real environments

526
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:15,380
we're going to do it within the case due

527
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,780
to legal restrictions you can see the

528
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,930
image on screen with ins it in there

529
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:23,540
that's the cage because inside we have

530
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:27,050
what can install nected through USB to a

531
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,570
connector as the antennas are connected

532
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:32,540
which is the USB cable connecting with a

533
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:37,040
camera you're seen whether the webcam is

534
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:39,260
Stern as I'm shutting down a lot of my

535
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,680
coverage and we are emitting and

536
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:45,410
signaling with this configuration I need

537
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,900
to check out that everything sorry let's

538
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:50,440
wait for some moments please can you

539
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,440
hear me properly

540
00:29:50,580 --> 00:30:01,039
I got a call here there is no coverage

541
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:06,090
little bars there in telling us the game

542
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:08,010
so far so good so the prohibition signal

543
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:14,939
appeared on screen we have captured the

544
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:16,980
MC from this terminal in C is my own MC

545
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,140
excessive it's my own enzymes giving

546
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,630
giving out my own envy for you to use it

547
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,179
if somebody want to attack me the in

548
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:28,049
sick catching attack is totally first of

549
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:30,000
all we need but now we had primitive to

550
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:34,200
the test in the practical is totally

551
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:39,139
possible on 3g and 2g as well so we're

552
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:41,399
stop emitting and to open the cage again

553
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:45,539
so far so good can you open the cage

554
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:48,719
pleased with this let's imagine the the

555
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:50,820
case worse scenario this is not a real

556
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,899
scenario an attacker interest in knowing

557
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:58,168
who is here will be walking around with

558
00:30:54,899 --> 00:31:02,510
a back pad inside without knowing

559
00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:05,279
ourselves and he is selling out

560
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:08,429
transmissions he is compiling all

561
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:12,389
instance from all mobile phones in this

562
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:14,580
room to be honest as we are sippers

563
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:17,330
experts on this we are we haven't done

564
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,269
anything regarding this so somebody

565
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:23,820
installing snap these software on is bc

566
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:26,940
but this is we're following the protocol

567
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:30,950
we accelerate all the configuration the

568
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:33,350
base station for this process to be the

569
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:36,330
successful if you are attacking

570
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:39,350
indiscriminately with implicating can be

571
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:42,590
done by any any any anybody else any

572
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:48,070
internet users can do MC catching

573
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:51,320
randomly and freely as well

574
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:53,000
hey I walk over to riah so so far so

575
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,270
good this is my phone God to the

576
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:01,490
coverage again so let's move on to the

577
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:06,800
next attack model is as dangerous one is

578
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:10,220
the denial of service attack for mobile

579
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:13,430
phones very beginning perhaps the night

580
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:15,740
of service was not start important but

581
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:19,570
today is so important the night of

582
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:22,220
servicing current mobile phone is

583
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:25,429
relevant for emergencies we need

584
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,560
coverage to receive to call somebody to

585
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,080
connect with data the most important

586
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,780
thing to stand wise apps of course

587
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,960
whatsapp's while using mobile phones to

588
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:39,430
send out with us all the time service is

589
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,200
a must service have to be with us but

590
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:44,540
this the mobile phone service there are

591
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:48,140
so many ways to deny the service the

592
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:50,110
most typical and rude way is what it

593
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,600
called inhibition that represents wicked

594
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:55,969
inhibitor we send out an electromagnetic

595
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,260
noise into the atmosphere and this is it

596
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:02,360
period with this we deny the service so

597
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,180
we kind of be selected when attacking I

598
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,189
cannot say okay I attack tu and not the

599
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,950
others I'm gonna be selected it's not

600
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:12,890
also a persistent attack if I switch out

601
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:18,350
my inhibitor and the night of service

602
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:21,860
stops working and of course on the user

603
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:24,219
can see that it does that there is no

604
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,659
coverage we saw that the prohibition

605
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:30,590
sign again there is another attack with

606
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:32,240
ease the exhaustion of radio channels

607
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:36,050
from the base station and still they are

608
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,390
ran out but I I I need to do to do to do

609
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:41,840
so so he's not persistence like the one

610
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:46,730
possible and likely attack on three

611
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:49,399
students 2g and if I inhibit at tone a

612
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:51,920
bit 33 this is the denied service

613
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:56,020
because the user fans I have a service

614
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:59,330
but I don't have it I am sending this

615
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,800
code to an a black hole this can be a

616
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,899
massive attack

617
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,460
selective dragon I can see I can say

618
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,090
okay this insist attackable and the

619
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:11,020
other is not but it's not it is

620
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:14,750
transparent because the user knows but

621
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:17,620
they must have a service but it is a

622
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:24,409
persist persist because the base station

623
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:28,130
needs to have it so some two years ago

624
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:30,350
on to team there's a kind of attack with

625
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:34,130
an effect 3 green in a massive and

626
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:36,949
selective way this side is persistent I

627
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:40,640
go there if I deny the service to you

628
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:43,669
just having a service for when depending

629
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,109
on your terminal and I did you pointed

630
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:50,270
to put it on open mode or until it is

631
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:53,210
initiated but years yourself in many

632
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:56,420
cases and in some of the cases depending

633
00:34:53,210 --> 00:35:00,170
on the other the phone the phone tells

634
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:03,980
you okay you have the coverage because

635
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:06,170
when you are calling somebody that the

636
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,270
phone tells you okay I cannot proceed

637
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:12,730
with this phone call so this kind of

638
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:16,040
attack some implications that will see

639
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:18,980
later so what's the main part

640
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:23,000
technically speaking of d is the attack

641
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:25,280
very simply when the phone tries to

642
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,860
register itself in the stage and I can

643
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,790
accept it or deny it if I accepted phone

644
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:34,580
I'm giving service on three mm 2g I can

645
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:37,670
accept it back in on 3g I cannot do so

646
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:40,130
because on 3g acceptance is encrypted

647
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:43,670
and protected I cannot accept it at both

648
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:46,060
on 2g and 3G I can refuse it because

649
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:49,880
refuser is not protected on encryption

650
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:53,170
so we on the refusal we can see a code a

651
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:57,530
refusal code I refuse you because I

652
00:35:53,170 --> 00:36:01,100
don't know you you are strange MC for

653
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:06,670
myself why refuse you because you are an

654
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:09,410
illegal mobile phone what does the phone

655
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:12,740
do one is in a league of mobile phone

656
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:13,270
the standard procedure is to verify that

657
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:19,959
the

658
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:22,600
must must must have stopped service the

659
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,210
mall formats stopped working without

660
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,160
service this simple technique is used to

661
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:30,070
deny the service to a very specific

662
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:35,109
particular model phone or several others

663
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:37,720
we can put a NC filter or not suggest

664
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:42,360
like the current technique is in place

665
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:46,419
for what do we need as of today when you

666
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:49,180
UMTS on 2d or 3d there is no

667
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:53,230
configuration parameter to select the

668
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:57,009
refusal code so we need to take the

669
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:59,140
software to modify it lightly to refuse

670
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:02,410
it with this specific code we have

671
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:04,240
implemented this with very simple code

672
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:11,620
modification purposely down let's see

673
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:14,910
what happens this is a mall phone which

674
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:19,990
is now in service and instead of

675
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:22,839
starting the radio base version let's

676
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:26,379
start a different release which is

677
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:31,210
called with his name please shut down

678
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:37,360
this some cage place otherwise it could

679
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:41,700
be able to refuse any of you so let's

680
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,700
wait for the mall font register

681
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,340
is reporting there is little little

682
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:52,340
coverage inside the room there's no

683
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:55,010
coverage now it is what the model is

684
00:37:52,340 --> 00:38:04,730
reporting is either modify is going to

685
00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:08,870
register very briefly Wow we got the

686
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:11,360
prohibition signal coming in now it's

687
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:18,200
not fixed it's not fixed this this

688
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:20,510
provision signals not fix oh it should

689
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:25,700
be should be there just a sec one sec

690
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:36,470
players so far so good please one more

691
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:38,750
sec you can see that the log which still

692
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:44,689
says that as of today the 28th of

693
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:47,620
November 2015 ad 1046 this is that the

694
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:50,720
information given to them one sec please

695
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:54,560
pay attention to the mobile phone the

696
00:38:50,720 --> 00:39:03,230
mobile has coverage as says but these

697
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:05,000
three key athena vanished you can see it

698
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:08,120
it hasn't coverage but this the 3g

699
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,300
signal has disappeared but the user

700
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:15,950
would mpa wouldn't notice this there's

701
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:18,380
now opened the cage please open the cage

702
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,899
we are not signaling out we are not

703
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:25,100
sending out signals now let's open the

704
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:27,230
cage for the mobile phone to to get

705
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,710
coverage again let's see if our mail

706
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,240
phone has coverage in grey in a wire the

707
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:35,080
more the mobile phone will tell us it

708
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,080
has coverage game

709
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:46,099
it's reporting the house cabbage the

710
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:48,739
mobile phone says has have coverage

711
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:52,909
because discovered is only for doing

712
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:56,209
emergency calls if you call 1120 the

713
00:39:52,909 --> 00:39:58,609
captors emergency number the protocol

714
00:39:56,209 --> 00:40:02,299
specifically goes through our channel

715
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:04,429
you make an emergency call even though

716
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,959
you haven't different operators it is

717
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:09,349
thought for this purpose even though you

718
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:12,969
have even you don't have a sim card you

719
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:16,039
can do so so let us proceed let's cool

720
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:28,209
let's call yourself on this entire

721
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:31,969
agenda if you remember you have to press

722
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:34,868
this button it's tried to do so when

723
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:39,219
calling we are not sending out signals

724
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:41,779
the attacker has gone nonetheless the

725
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:44,829
the mall phone and says I have no

726
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:48,409
coverage until when until you put it on

727
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:53,169
open mode or you initiated the Dimona

728
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:55,219
phone let's see that we didn't break the

729
00:40:53,169 --> 00:41:00,558
terminal the mobile phone is now

730
00:40:55,219 --> 00:41:05,239
operational again let's see if it's on

731
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:09,769
plane mode if you press the button upper

732
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:14,490
right where can I say it in the middle

733
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:18,509
of the screen here we go

734
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:21,899
this is plane mode I take them change

735
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:25,880
them plane mode and it goes back to the

736
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:30,270
the thing I'm out of service but in

737
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:32,580
little sex okay you can get h flowers oh

738
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:36,660
we got the voice and data connection we

739
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:42,600
tried to make a phone call we got

740
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:47,060
service again and please press down to

741
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,060
the button the boxing of the bathroom

742
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:56,670
this is the block on the screen but the

743
00:41:50,640 --> 00:42:01,230
core is currently being there so far so

744
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:03,960
good let's proceed yes the call the

745
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:06,780
phone call is not going to to to riches

746
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,910
because it's our claim amount not to

747
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:12,090
disturb you during this presentation but

748
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:19,200
it nice the phone call is being

749
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:27,510
projecting I can I can suppress the

750
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:30,868
plane Mary if you want you it would be a

751
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:34,320
register and will be beeping and sunday

752
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:36,750
in the moment he gets the phone call we

753
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,490
want to show you to our disappointment

754
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:43,680
when we check out for the very first

755
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:46,950
time when the we shut down the raytheon

756
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,799
the mall phone we put on the plane mode

757
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:52,859
and we're initiate the telephone gets

758
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,100
back to normal we reread some standard

759
00:42:52,859 --> 00:43:00,480
this will be the activity 4 for 4 good

760
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:03,930
for life but we saw that the phone works

761
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,859
properly perfectly so it was feasible to

762
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:10,770
tea but now is visible on 3g how can we

763
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:12,960
apply this technique us for good things

764
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:15,509
and bad things for the battle that guy

765
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,660
is not jacquard that want to deny us the

766
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:23,010
service can go with a car having this

767
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:25,009
radio station running around the city he

768
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,980
wants to target

769
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:29,810
and you been i applying this technique

770
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:33,800
the attackers lips around with a car and

771
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:36,529
the nice services to all people with the

772
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,870
operator sending out signals or

773
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,370
different operators or mobile phones

774
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,920
connected with different operators on

775
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:46,700
the attack around and his car can

776
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:50,140
specifically target me can be nice meet

777
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:53,629
my service specifically on me that this

778
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:56,000
procedure can also be down by good

779
00:43:53,630 --> 00:44:00,110
things this application scenario prison

780
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,880
a bomb explosive device activated the

781
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,970
model phones if we want to secure eyes

782
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:08,510
scenario we want to this you want to

783
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:11,200
display frequency inhibitors on the area

784
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:14,300
another option more aggression alee

785
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,970
where specific circumstances we can have

786
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:21,260
this service we can run around this area

787
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:24,049
and deny that service on this area so

788
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:28,450
we'll get a fabulous reasonable security

789
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:32,720
especially if it's a conventionally

790
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:36,169
non-modified mobile phone and on it days

791
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,149
man we can't deny wicked night out of

792
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,460
the models on the area he only has the

793
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:43,130
attacker reinitiate the mobile phones

794
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:46,310
manually he the attacker wouldn't be

795
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:49,310
able to activate a bomb or an explosive

796
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:52,640
so so many applications with these

797
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:56,509
mechanisms it's very interesting for us

798
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,370
to know that this is inject systems for

799
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:02,090
the people to know how to protect

800
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:05,240
against these menaces and threats so so

801
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:08,420
far so good we have shown today that out

802
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:13,129
of the previous things and checking out

803
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:16,100
the rules and standards visible on 2g

804
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:19,280
are now in the country and denial of

805
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:23,029
service selective and permanently or

806
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,730
semi-permanently doable is it we have

807
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:29,840
tested to you that is absolutely

808
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:35,090
workable what else are we doing i can

809
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:39,570
show now regarding geo localization on

810
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:44,100
we constructed a system that allows us

811
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:49,350
on the screen gives you the position of

812
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:52,860
a telephone the MC arm that the seam as

813
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:55,589
I am a code card and you put it on a car

814
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:59,400
so on that area you will be driving

815
00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:01,950
around area until detected and gives you

816
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:05,100
the geolocation coordinates where

817
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:09,720
supposedly the target was situated as

818
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:16,040
you a drug around the estimation of the

819
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:18,509
targetable thin was exactly determined

820
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:20,910
there are some parts of the standard

821
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:24,120
procedure that allowed the carrier to

822
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:26,490
xml phone okay where am i and the mobile

823
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:31,740
phone says this is my dps oh it's your

824
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:34,549
location but can we find mouth home even

825
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:37,200
though try not to answer these network

826
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:41,270
questions not revealing the GPS

827
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:46,220
coordinates this was based upon the GMs

828
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:49,259
standard not an not on geo localization

829
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:51,899
specific services regarding jee loke

830
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,060
station feasible for 2 T is also

831
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,520
feasible for 3d we're trying to

832
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:00,180
implement it let's see how we can get

833
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:03,440
this is a time estimation database and

834
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:07,620
to get the triangle of our mobile phone

835
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,780
so regarding 2g selected drug and brandt

836
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:15,210
downgrade to convince a mobile phone in

837
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:18,660
step 3 team not now I please connect

838
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:19,980
yourself to these 2 g's cell because

839
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:23,670
this is going to give a marvelous

840
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:27,570
service this is a select downgrade to

841
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:29,550
this mobile yes not to the other this is

842
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,830
this another kind of attack

843
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:34,410
theoretically speaking by looking at the

844
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:36,779
standard is visible so we need to find

845
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:39,089
time to prove it and implement it

846
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:41,700
properly

847
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:44,400
and regarding the future we'll have to

848
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,868
continue with the sniffer words because

849
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,239
it's been abandoned by us because its

850
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:55,400
own hard work we have a little time and

851
00:47:51,239 --> 00:48:00,989
of course we need to study and to test

852
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:04,440
this on 30 40 40 we need to look into

853
00:48:00,989 --> 00:48:05,729
detail on these scale scenarios but we

854
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,589
need to study improve all these

855
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:15,118
techniques equally visible on 4G

856
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:18,690
networks on the black on the black hat

857
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:22,710
they talk about MC catching we can move

858
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:26,819
on from three get into 40 39 of service

859
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:29,579
and refuses we're visible on to g3 pad

860
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:32,190
is also facing long 40 we need to check

861
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:34,349
out all these on 40 on ourselves but

862
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:37,499
it's going to work as well let's see if

863
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:43,319
the other remaining attacks given can be

864
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:47,700
done on 440 like I said so conclusions

865
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:50,519
we can draw from obvious this is MC

866
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:52,710
Canton and the Negev services you saw it

867
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:55,618
in a very practical terms are totally

868
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:58,440
feasible didn't remain attacks on the 2g

869
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:04,079
about geo localization and then

870
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:06,119
downgrade selectively we have some high

871
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,089
expectations about that they are visible

872
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:13,829
well we are trying to implement it

873
00:49:09,089 --> 00:49:16,200
depending on our timing and on for Jesus

874
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:18,359
David told to us these attacks are also

875
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,759
festival and like clay this is the

876
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:22,828
conclusion we can draw from our talk

877
00:49:20,759 --> 00:49:25,079
thank you very much for your time your

878
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:27,569
attendance so you have any questions

879
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:28,920
please raise your hands we're we're free

880
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:31,069
to answer your questions thank you very

881
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,069
much

882
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:52,130
all I want ask all another one question

883
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:56,629
please once the attack is conducted the

884
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:58,760
attacker leaves some trays tried there

885
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:02,300
is any way for me to know if have been

886
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:07,010
attacked I lost my coverage and I have

887
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:08,900
to initiate my phone I both from well

888
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:12,470
depending on the the hands at the dimona

889
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:15,200
phone on a normal mobile phone locks are

890
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:17,270
on days dance and they are not

891
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,069
accessible for users if your instrument

892
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:23,240
instrumentalized a mobile phone to

893
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:25,340
accept you will receive a refusal code

894
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:28,790
it's very spaced range would be very

895
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:31,610
funny when your model phone is Robert

896
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:34,370
stolen you get this denial cup if it's

897
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:36,560
your mobile phone this refusal code is

898
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:39,650
very strange for you to receive it would

899
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:42,140
be an unequivocal indicator that either

900
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:44,720
they operate or got run or you are being

901
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:46,970
attacked by somebody so the answer if

902
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,089
you instrumentalize the model phone you

903
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:53,779
see in the Nile code and you haven't

904
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:56,510
been a rough or stolen is definitely an

905
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:59,390
attack being you have been attacked so

906
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:01,640
you detect you don't have a coverage so

907
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:04,400
it's not because perhaps the attack

908
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:07,700
itself sanka man from a security point

909
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:11,000
would be idea that the screen she should

910
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:14,689
have told you something I got an illegal

911
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,330
MC refusal that's so far so good more

912
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:19,630
and more the screens don't give you

913
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:23,569
details on the mobile phone because the

914
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:27,920
the user should be worried about every

915
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:29,870
day light not about their security so if

916
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,180
it's not an encrypted communication

917
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:34,430
would be different from myself being

918
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:37,569
interested in my mobile phone showing me

919
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:41,839
an icon when it is not encrypted on 2g

920
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:45,140
can do so without encryption I would

921
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:49,690
like to sew in you we saw it in the

922
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:54,410
former all mobile phones that we got a

923
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:57,630
lock open when the communication was not

924
00:51:54,410 --> 00:52:01,140
encrypted this was in our model phone

925
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:03,619
so modern model phones smart phones do

926
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:09,750
not notify about these security issues

927
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:12,450
unfortunately regarding some phone so

928
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:15,269
that we can we can configure okay I'm

929
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:18,210
only accepting 3g service or 2g but

930
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:22,250
other other muffins done and allow us to

931
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:28,289
configure specific and accepting 4G 3G

932
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:31,559
to avoid doing a downgrade to 2t from 4G

933
00:52:28,289 --> 00:52:36,680
and getting non proper communications

934
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:39,119
once MCS codified can we duplicate and

935
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:42,180
can we put ourselves on the receiver

936
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:45,750
mode in such a way that when the

937
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:48,299
original is transmitting you can see it

938
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:51,690
as your stud you can see the messages on

939
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:54,480
your own being sent out to you from the

940
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:57,690
original is its visible very interesting

941
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,839
question my answer is no you cannot do

942
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:04,049
so with the inset you got the users

943
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:05,849
identifier so and you will be able to

944
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:07,440
know where the user is located when you

945
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:10,109
are around up because the ins in the

946
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,900
very end so soon but this does not allow

947
00:53:10,109 --> 00:53:16,680
you to duplicate the user himsel do to

948
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:19,559
pretend impersonate the user you cannot

949
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,788
listen to the real communications that

950
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:22,740
you should have with the network you

951
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:25,529
cannot pretend to be the user within

952
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,089
simple aims that's not first of all if

953
00:53:25,529 --> 00:53:29,309
you want to have service on the network

954
00:53:27,089 --> 00:53:31,920
you need to tell the network ok I have

955
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:34,950
this in zebra and it also to prove that

956
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,160
the and the owner of the dis in sync

957
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:40,439
with the channels channel response the

958
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,200
network sanction a random number and the

959
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:46,470
model phone has to answer back to you

960
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:49,980
with a with a key with them not the in

961
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:53,669
CA key which is a store on the sim card

962
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:57,420
only on the sinker inside and the o/n on

963
00:53:53,670 --> 00:54:01,740
the courier on the database service on

964
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:05,009
the carrier these two these kids share

965
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:06,808
by the two parts and it has to be used

966
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:09,509
by the mall phone to calculate figure

967
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:10,470
out the answer you may have the answer

968
00:54:09,509 --> 00:54:14,160
but since

969
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:16,200
don't have the shared kitchen share

970
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,750
inside you cannot get back give out a

971
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,140
valid answer but you can also perhaps

972
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:25,530
get this key in such a way because the

973
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:26,879
there is a broken cryptography and you

974
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:29,700
are listening the dialogue between the

975
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:33,810
mobile phone and the operator so with

976
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:35,580
the accession key here you can tamper

977
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:39,060
with the mall phone and in person

978
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:42,119
somebody on three key there have been

979
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:46,230
attacks where you could get the session

980
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:50,640
a key without breaking the the

981
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:54,270
cryptography but weird I Aquarius ss7 if

982
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:56,339
somebody in filters in this network and

983
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:59,040
the operator still chance it tells you

984
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:01,920
the carrion key in the session with this

985
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:05,609
thing on 3g they can pretend not to be

986
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,520
under the victim sweet but the MC is not

987
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:15,210
enough you also need the keys through

988
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:17,130
other methods sorry please please use

989
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:19,339
the microphone there is no microphone in

990
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:24,630
use we cannot hear the question

991
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:28,529
unfortunately there is no microphone you

992
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:30,990
used you said before about the certain

993
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:33,570
packages to the activated bomb if the

994
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:36,540
attacker the terrorists configures that

995
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:39,830
I have received a package can you know

996
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:41,970
if the package is correctly configured

997
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:43,200
inhibitors would be the only way to know

998
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:46,319
in this case we could you cannot know

999
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,660
that to do so the attacker needs to have

1000
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,339
the control of the baseband not about

1001
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,220
the operation of a consistent on the

1002
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:56,130
model phone what is running through the

1003
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:58,740
chipset specifically on world font is

1004
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:01,740
free word if you can throw the baseband

1005
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:04,189
you can program that otherwise not so

1006
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:08,879
its own is only feasible with this

1007
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:10,530
protection measure to the normal phones

1008
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,040
where users don't have access to the

1009
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:15,480
baseband please there is no microphone

1010
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,790
in use interpreters kind of hear the

1011
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,240
question

1012
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:24,170
it's my my my question is when you clone

1013
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,029
an operator with a sim the MC and the

1014
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:29,840
keys are there is saying on the two

1015
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:33,620
seems very good question the question my

1016
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:36,020
answer is now what is unique for you as

1017
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:37,580
a user is that your phone number the

1018
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:40,880
phone number does not appear on the

1019
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:44,750
scene car is high in car there is an MC

1020
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:47,540
on the scene car and a secret key the

1021
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:50,420
operator takes another is I am car with

1022
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:52,520
another MC as a secret key and they

1023
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:56,840
write down and tells you this now

1024
00:56:52,520 --> 00:57:00,880
belongs to mr. Joe name they assign

1025
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:03,050
allocate this on the database and the

1026
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,540
phone number that is going to answer to

1027
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:06,800
this M situation as previous the aims is

1028
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:09,050
not the same the keys on saying that

1029
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:12,350
very same thing is that on the operators

1030
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:15,560
career database where they said the

1031
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:20,240
picture Paris in say is I take it out

1032
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:23,000

yes please there is no microphone in use

1035
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,920
interpreters cannot hear the question

1036
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:37,900
a last question no no more questions

1037
