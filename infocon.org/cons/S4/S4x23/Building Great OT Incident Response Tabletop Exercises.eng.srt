1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm Leslie I am the person you never

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,440
want to see outside the context of this

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,880
wonderful educational environment

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,120
because my team and I are at dragos

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,680
are the people who show up on

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,020
organizations worst day ever when they

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,240
are having a cyber security incident in

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,279
their critical process environment

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,619
so basically people see me for training

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,420
for talks and they're like I hope I

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,519
never see you ever again I don't I don't

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,859
take any offense to that

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,040
when I end up in those worst days ever

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,380
for these organizations

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,360
there's something that I find I find

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,000
that there's been a lot of assumptions

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,460
and those assumptions tend to be about

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,980
organizations capacity to do incident

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,379
response or even that they would have to

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,660
deal with incident response in their OT

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,660
environments

23
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,239
so first of all let's nip this one in

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,180
the bud every single one of us in this

25
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,000
room outside of it who has a process

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,099
environment can potentially have a cyber

27
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,200
security incident in it I keep running

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,060
into organizations where they've made

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,979
these assumptions they have said things

30
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:11,820
like

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,799
I'm too big to have a cyber security

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,119
incident I've got all these security

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,860
controls I've got this huge cyber

34
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,580
security team and it will never be me

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,860
and then somebody makes a human error or

36
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,180
something gets connected to the internet

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,159
in the wrong way a transient asset comes

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,040
in there's an Insider and they have a

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
cyber security incident and they're not

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,100
ready for it

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,560
or they think that they're too small

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,020
and uninteresting have a cyber security

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,820
incident

44
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,220
and that's wrong because big bad

45
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,960
adversary comes in and uses them as a

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,880
test bed for an attack against a bigger

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,939
organization or ransomware actor has a

48
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,500
campaign and they're just a target of

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,540
opportunity but in the end they have a

50
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,060
cyber security incident unfortunately

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,360
so planning to do good incident response

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,640
in your OT environment not just your it

53
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,619
Enterprise environment is really

54
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,659
important this is something that can

55
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,579
potentially happen to all of us and I

56
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,259
see it all the time people just aren't

57
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,699
ready

58
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,038
and like any other crisis we can

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,540
potentially have in a process

60
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,160
environment in a life and safety

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,959
environment it's really important to

62
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,819
drill these plans and procedures in

63
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,680
advance

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
so today I want to tell you about

65
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,080
tabletop exercises for your OT

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,980
environments for your process

67
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,800
environments or cyber security incidents

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,080
let's get on the same page here what I'm

69
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280
talking about when I talk about a

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,819
tabletop exercise or TTX is a totally

71
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,040
safe practice of your incident response

72
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,260
processes and procedures around a table

73
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,900
it's entirely in your brains and on pen

74
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,879
and paper not interacting with your

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,560
critical systems you're not touching

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
anything there's no concerns about

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
messing up your process creating a

78
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
downtime window you're getting all your

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,660
stakeholders in incident response into a

80
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,640
room and you're talking through and

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,379
testing your ability to go through your

82
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,780
processes and procedures for that worst

83
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,140
day ever

84
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,400
do I have a very short amount of time

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
here very short amount of time here to

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,239
tell you what a TTX is and give my

87
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,739
elevator pitch on why you should be

88
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,540
doing it and then I want to give you a

89
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,099
little crash course so you can make

90
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,680
educated decisions about whether you

91
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,120
need some help if you need to bring in

92
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,920
some outside parties to help you run a

93
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,720
tabletop or be ready to do it internally

94
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,940
or whether you should be doing it yet at

95
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,800
all where you should be building some

96
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,659
more basic cyber security architecture

97
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,980
in advance

98
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,599
I want to tell you a little bit about

99
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,940
how these table tops in OT are different

100
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,739
ones than ones you might have done in

101
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,780
your it environment because incident

102
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,700
response really is different in OT

103
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,920
that's why I specialize in that

104
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,239
specifically

105
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,220
I'm going to tell you some gotchas that

106
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,260
I always see happen in these table tops

107
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,640
you can get ahead of them a little bit

108
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,560
and then the stuff that you'll need to

109
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,860
develop to make these exercises happen

110
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,680
and I will tell you some things about

111
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,140
measuring success so how to quantify

112
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,560
success in your tabletop exercises

113
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,360
because you know everybody loves kpis

114
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,799
especially as you go up the ladder right

115
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,140
all right

116
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,360
so you should this is my elevator pitch

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,159
I'm not trying to sell you something

118
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,980
here you can do ttx's internally if you

119
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,540
have the capacity to do it that's great

120
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,279
just do them

121
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,459
incident response in OT is not the same

122
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,860
as incident response in I.T you have

123
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,600
life and safety concerns you're dealing

124
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,060
with different types of systems I often

125
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,560
talk talk to organizations that have

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,060
made assumptions about this and I'm like

127
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,919
so what happens if somebody tampers with

128
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,600
this rtu what do you do forensically

129
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,639
then and there's like this this look of

130
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,800
shock on their faces like oh I didn't

131
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,720
think about that like I don't know how

132
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,160
to do forensics on that what kind of

133
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,960
cable does it take does it have some

134
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,060
kind of firmware I can work with I don't

135
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,740
know do we need to think through these

136
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,240
things in advance

137
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
there's also all the the safety decision

138
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,199
making in terms of where you can do

139
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,880
incident response how you do it who

140
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,259
needs to be involved in decision making

141
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,240
for things like containment these

142
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,040
environments are totally different and

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,780
the way that we do digital forensics and

144
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,160
incident response in them is totally

145
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
different you need to be doing these

146
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
discrete tabletops for those really

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,040
important environments

148
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,259
incidents are really high pressure if

149
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,880
you've never had to deal with a cyber

150
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,160
security incident they are scary they

151
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,660
are fast paced sometimes they happen at

152
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,280
2 A.M on Christmas when everybody's

153
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,240
hungover

154
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,220
yeah that's when they have a series they

155
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,840
know when to attack come on they're not

156
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,900
stupid and there's a lot of stages and

157
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,520
moving parts that need to happen to

158
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,979
respond to these terrible days

159
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,740
so this is really important to do in a

160
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,080
safe environment in advance you need to

161
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,400
practice these plans you need to build

162
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,139
these plans you need to have an idea

163
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,940
what these plans need to look like and

164
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,560
then you need to give them a shot in a

165
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,300
safe environment and there is no safer

166
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,280
environment to test your plans than

167
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,960
sitting in chairs like this and talking

168
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,100
through it

169
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,780
but it's a little more complicated than

170
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,520
that so let's talk about that

171
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,039
first of all to be able to do tabletop

172
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,500
exercises you need some basic

173
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,660
prerequisite stuff okay

174
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,000
so you need to have some procedures even

175
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,740
if they're back of a napkin you need to

176
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,600
have some idea

177
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,580
of what your process is for incident

178
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,220
response so who gets called how do you

179
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,960
communicate what are you going to do

180
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,520
step by step how are you going to do

181
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,860
forensics etc etc so you need to have

182
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,120
something written down to follow

183
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,280
otherwise what are you drilling you know

184
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,020
and that means that you need to have a

185
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,759
basic understanding of Who's involved

186
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,160
who is going to be a member of your

187
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,960
broader incident Response Team not just

188
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,660
the cyber security people but in OT like

189
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,520
who needs to be involved in safety

190
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
decision making who are your business

191
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,600
continuity planners

192
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,280
um would you need to have legal or HR

193
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,900
potentially involved so who are the

194
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,060
stakeholder holders in incident response

195
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,819
in your organization in OT

196
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,319
and what data sources do you have to

197
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,520
work with you're going to do some

198
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,080
analysis right you're going to do some

199
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,360
forensics you might want to have an idea

200
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,520
of what stuff you have to work with so

201
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,319
that you can walk through those

202
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,520
processes

203
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,319
and you need to have an understanding of

204
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,880
what your worst day ever could

205
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,280
potentially look like right that's

206
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,900
that's a difficult question sometimes

207
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,400
that can take a lot of time to talk

208
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,620
through your crown jewels what's really

209
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,780
important in your environment

210
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,840
what is your terrible day in your in

211
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,160
your environment that's not an easy

212
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,840
question you need to ask that at the

213
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,120
highest levels is it

214
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,580
life and safety issues could somebody

215
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,080
get injured could they get killed is

216
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,400
that your worst day ever is it your

217
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,400
facility catching on fire is it your

218
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,680
equipment getting damaged so once you

219
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,180
start working down from there you start

220
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,639
making very realistic scary scenarios of

221
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,080
what that worth today ever could look

222
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,460
like and then you can figure out whether

223
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,460
there's potentially a cyber Clause of

224
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,919
those hazards of those potential

225
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,720
terrible things that could happen

226
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,000
so those give you those ideas of what

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,340
you should actually drill so what could

228
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,680
go wrong why might we need to respond to

229
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,479
a cyber security incident

230
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,400
and finally you need to have a

231
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,919
willingness to play the game and be a

232
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,780
good sport about it I know this sounds

233
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,400
really straightforward and really simple

234
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,139
but it's not

235
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,240
there is a lot of bad blood between I.T

236
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,460
cyber security and OT we all know that

237
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,080
there's bad relationships out there and

238
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,759
that makes it challenging to do this

239
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,919
stuff right because people think that

240
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,000
they're being graded they're being

241
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,440
audited and they don't want to play

242
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,599
nicely so if you don't have Cooperative

243
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,580
players who are there to learn to

244
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,500
succeed and to support each other your

245
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,539
tabletop isn't going to be a success so

246
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,479
if those things are not in place yet you

247
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:22,919
probably want to take a step back and

248
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,599
look at those issues before you even

249
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,160
start drilling

250
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,520
stuff because it's going to go awry

251
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,379
this is pretty basic though almost

252
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,880
everybody in here should be doing

253
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,880
tabletop exercises

254
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,740
and then once you have those things in

255
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,659
place you have to begin the process of

256
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,640
developing a TTX so some simple

257
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,440
questions you need to answer right away

258
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,420
is how long do we have to dedicate to

259
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,060
this TTX when are we going to do it and

260
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,220
who's going to be involved who are our

261
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,560
IR stakeholders and you can do a

262
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,380
tabletop exercise with just your core IR

263
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,959
cyber security people or you can do one

264
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,940
with your broader team of stakeholders

265
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,459
so everybody up to your Executives your

266
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,740
OT people your legal people your

267
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,240
corporate Communications people all

268
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,560
those would be involved in a cyber

269
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,540
security incident I'm not going to tell

270
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,640
you one is better than the other they're

271
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,440
both different things you're testing out

272
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
different capabilities you should do

273
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,779
both

274
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,459
so you need to make decisions about that

275
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,720
who's going to play

276
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,580
and then your scenario again I told you

277
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,620
you need to have some idea of what a bad

278
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,360
day might look like so that you can

279
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,399
drill it out and we'll talk about how

280
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,560
you develop that in a formulaic way

281
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,940
because you're going to need to develop

282
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,040
some documents to support that building

283
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,200
a game is it's hard work it takes a

284
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,060
little time what you're going to need to

285
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,060
produce is a timeline and from that

286
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,680
timeline you're going to select a series

287
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,120
of injects I'll show you what those

288
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,100
looks like if you are in the government

289
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,019
or the military you may have heard of

290
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,940
this timeline with injects referred to

291
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,700
as a misal a master scenario event list

292
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,680
I see a few nodding heads out there

293
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,360
people who are in the military

294
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,820
but in general you're going to need to

295
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,620
develop these two documents which are a

296
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,040
timeline and a set of injects so your

297
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,380
players have a game to play

298
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,180
and you're going to probably need to

299
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,040
develop some documents some collateral

300
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,839
as well so they'll probably need their

301
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,700
documentation for how they handle an

302
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,399
incident they might need printouts of

303
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,200
this timeline and inject that we'll talk

304
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,820
about but you're probably going to need

305
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,440
to hand them some paperwork so that

306
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,920
they're prepared to play the game well

307
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,800
now who here I'm going to ask I'm

308
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
putting the audience on the spot who

309
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,820
here has ever played a tabletop RPG

310
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,160
Dungeons and Dragons groups Pathfinder

311
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,720
oh there's some hand look I thought

312
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,860
there was going to be no one and I would

313
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,380
just be standing up here like an idiot

314
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,600
um something that you will find as you

315
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
play

316
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,779
non-educational games as you play

317
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,820
recreational tabletop games is that

318
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,100
players never do what you expect them to

319
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,100
do you will plan out a scenario for your

320
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,440
players to go fight the dragon and they

321
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,300
will decide to go to the pub and chat up

322
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,579
a wizard instead so that's that's kind

323
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,320
of how that works with these tabletops

324
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,420
as well your players will never follow

325
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,459
your plan for what is supposed to happen

326
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,740
you'll expect them to contain the

327
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,600
malware and they will be like arguing

328
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,060
over who to call about lunch or

329
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,459
something so that will happen

330
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,079
and that means that we need to have

331
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,240
really good documentation and plans to

332
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,940
try to keep them kind of on track as

333
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,920
best as we can and they're going to ask

334
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,240
you questions right too because we're

335
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,339
playing this out on paper they don't

336
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,560
actually have access to do forensics on

337
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,940
a computer so they're going to ask you

338
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,380
hey I did forensics on this computer

339
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,420
what did I find so you don't want to be

340
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,760
caught and have to like Wing that I do

341
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,740
it's fun but really you don't want to be

342
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,660
caught and have to Wing that you want to

343
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,040
have that written down you want to have

344
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,660
a good idea of everything that happened

345
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,279
that the bad people did to the

346
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,019
environment during your worst day ever

347
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,760
so that when they ask that question

348
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,860
you're like well you find this

349
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,420
and you then you're ready to go then

350
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,920
it's less threatening when your players

351
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,540
are like yeah we're going to go to the

352
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,800
pub and chat up the wizard and you're

353
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
like you guys you're doing cyber

354
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,380
security incident response right now

355
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,060
there's no Wizards

356
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,339
um but anyway so you you want it you

357
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,959
want to build that good timeline and

358
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,240
have those artifacts for them to find as

359
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,339
they do pretend forensics and log

360
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,720
analysis and they look at their

361
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,160
industrial devices and look at their

362
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,360
process

363
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,100
and then you're going to select some

364
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,899
stuff out of that timeline so you've

365
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,579
built this big timeline of the stuff

366
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,380
that happens that the bad people did Big

367
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,600
Bad adversary did or the malware did

368
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,160
and then you're going to select some

369
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,200
visible things that they see happening

370
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,600
that impact their response as injects

371
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,940
out of that timeline so the stuff that

372
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,040
would impact their decision making and

373
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
make them change course and make them

374
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,779
escalate things you're going to select a

375
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,279
few of those depending on the amount of

376
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,620
time you have as your injects and those

377
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,300
are things you're going to announce on a

378
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,920
schedule so let's look at what this

379
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,480
actually looks like

380
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
so here I show you an example of a

381
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,220
timeline for a TTX and those of you have

382
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,459
done incident response reports before

383
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:51,959
are probably going hey that looks just

384
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,339
like a timeline from an incident

385
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,040
response report because it is you are

386
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,620
making up an incident right you've got a

387
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,420
time stamp and you've got things in time

388
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,399
order that the bad people did to the

389
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,040
computers so maybe they they did they

390
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,260
stole a computer in this you know this

391
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,600
is an exploitation of a computer using a

392
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,459
phishing email so there's a series of

393
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,079
events that happens there right behind

394
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:14,940
the scenes so somebody clicks on the

395
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,380
phishing email then the computer gets

396
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,600
exploited and then the adversary gets

397
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,980
onto the computer and they start moving

398
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,600
laterally those all have times

399
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,639
associated with them right just like a

400
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,440
incident report you would read about an

401
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,540
intrusion into an organization

402
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,820
and you can leave yourself some notes

403
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,380
about where they might find records of

404
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,540
those things if that helps you but if

405
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,180
they ask hey I checked my fishing

406
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,279
security Appliance to see if there was a

407
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,100
phishing email you go yeah and you check

408
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,500
and you see that at 804 there was an

409
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,300
email link clicked in an email that

410
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,399
looks rather suspicious and you've got

411
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,839
that it's written down so they can't

412
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,399
Blindside You by going to talk to the

413
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,500
wizard in the bar now so you got this

414
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,700
ready to go

415
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,660
and now now we have to choose some super

416
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,060
special moments in this timeline to

417
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,579
challenge them which are our injects and

418
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:04,139
an inject ends up looking like this

419
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,519
we're picking some things that are

420
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,480
visible

421
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,700
so in this case we have an employee

422
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,120
Susan Jones got her transient asset

423
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,040
laptop stolen out of her car and she

424
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,019
called loss prevention that's a thing

425
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,540
that's visible to the security team they

426
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,820
got a call that's a visible thing that

427
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,380
happened in that timeline of events

428
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,240
there might be things happening behind

429
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,620
the scenes there that they don't see

430
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,300
until they start doing forensics and

431
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,399
looking into their logs and things but

432
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,839
that's the thing that they know about

433
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,220
and they have to make some decisions

434
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,139
right they have to make some decisions

435
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,639
they have to ask Susan some questions

436
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,620
they have to escalate that to the right

437
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,940
people and now they might have an

438
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,380
incident on their hands depending on

439
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,300
their incident criteria

440
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,839
so these are things that push them to

441
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,760
start making decisions about incident

442
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
response whatever part of the incident

443
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,480
response team they are

444
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,779
so we select a few moments in time out

445
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,279
of our timeline of what the bad people

446
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,560
did that we developed and then we say

447
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,019
this is inject one two three and they

448
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,019
happen at XYZ times and so as we go

449
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,779
through our tabletop exercise we will

450
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,180
every so often stand up and say okay

451
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,880
guys this just happened Susan Jones is

452
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,740
on the phone ring ring you might put

453
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,139
this up on a big screen and say

454
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,639
she's called your Loss Prevention

455
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,500
Hotline and she says my laptop's been

456
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,540
stolen out of my car and then later on

457
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,399
you might have a different inject as the

458
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,100
adversary uses that laptop to VPN in and

459
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,380
they tamper with a safety system and

460
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,240
your process Engineers call in and say

461
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,899
hey I saw some wonky stuff happen so

462
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,940
that's how you develop these injects you

463
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,579
build that big timeline data dump of

464
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,019
everything that happens that the bad

465
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,300
people do and then you select some stuff

466
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,480
that's going to educate your users

467
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,000
all right so we've built our big

468
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,680
timeline that just looks like a normal

469
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,660
incident response time limit of stuff so

470
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,760
we're ready to go for most of the things

471
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,920
that our players will do and we selected

472
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,320
some injects to read through during the

473
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,300
course of the exercise that's our

474
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,980
exercise now we have to decide who's

475
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,940
going to play

476
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,680
so where are we going to hold this

477
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,680
exercise and who's going to do what so

478
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,519
you're going to need some different

479
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,100
roles in your tabletop okay you're going

480
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,779
to need a facilitator so they are your

481
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,760
game master you have to deal with all

482
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,199
this Mayhem that the players come up

483
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,880
with they are the people who are reading

484
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,160
off the injects when people want to go

485
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,019
look in logs or talk to somebody who's

486
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,480
in the game they talk to that person and

487
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,399
that that facilitator has to be ready to

488
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,220
say you look in the log and you see XYZ

489
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,980
at this time or yeah you call so and so

490
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,600
forth that I was totally not ready to

491
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,699
have you call and this is what they say

492
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,800
you call dragos and dragos gives you

493
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,079
this advice whatever you know you you

494
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,079
call whoever you call you Call uh sisa

495
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:44,579
and sisa says this

496
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,519
and so that person has to be ready to be

497
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,079
flexible and kind of play the game

498
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,300
they're as prepared as they can be but

499
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,360
they are acting as all those roles for

500
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
your players

501
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,820
and then you probably want to have

502
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,680
somebody taking notes and doing some

503
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,360
grading you know however you're going to

504
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,399
do that I'll suggest a few things in

505
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,079
this talk but you probably want to have

506
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,880
somebody dedicated just to seeing how

507
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,760
well you do and taking notes Etc so that

508
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,160
you can do better on the next exercise

509
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,439
and you'll have all your players and you

510
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,660
might have some observers the the thing

511
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,119
that's risky about having observers just

512
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,500
watching you play is that they're going

513
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,240
to want to jump in they always want to

514
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,040
jump in they're like I'll just observe

515
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,540
and then they're they're up front two

516
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,919
hours later they're up front in front of

517
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,240
the whole table taking over the whole

518
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,419
thing so if you have observers make sure

519
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:32,460
it's very very clear to them that they

520
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,500
are observers and they are not playing

521
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
the game they cannot they have to yeah

522
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,179
it's hard it's really hard they're going

523
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,160
to want to jump in so be cautious about

524
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,059
that

525
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,620
and for your injects that you've

526
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,020
selected out of your timeline you will

527
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,240
want to kind of Define those in advance

528
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,980
you'll kind of want to make sure you

529
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,240
know when you're going to call out each

530
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,799
one of the injects that you've selected

531
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,600
so again those visible things that are

532
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,220
going to change how their incident is

533
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,440
progressing and what's changing as they

534
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,480
go through the timeline of events

535
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,860
so you'll want to make sure that you

536
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,380
know when you're going to call those out

537
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,000
and then you execute this then you're

538
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,380
going to go play the game it's fun it's

539
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,120
a game you should be you should be chill

540
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,400
about this it's it's totally safe you're

541
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,840
just seeing whether things work or not

542
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,700
so you'll want to make sure you've got a

543
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,679
good environment to play in conducive to

544
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,900
practice so you'll want to make sure

545
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,580
that you can see everybody here

546
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,679
everybody everybody can get their voice

547
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:23,940
in

548
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,559
um that people are comfortable too now

549
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,940
things are a little bit different now

550
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,559
that a lot of events are hybrid or

551
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,600
remote the considerations are a little

552
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,740
bit different there if you're remote

553
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,600
make sure that there's no back

554
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,700
channeling going on on other chats so

555
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,140
that the Raiders the people who are

556
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,460
running the exercise could see

557
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,440
everything that's going on and if you're

558
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,179
in a hybrid environment make sure that

559
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,340
like everybody in a conference room is

560
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,720
around the microphone so the remote

561
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,240
people can hear them so the normal

562
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,760
challenges we face just escalated more

563
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,780
so because there's a lot of people

564
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,700
playing and you want them to be all able

565
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,780
to equitably participate in the exercise

566
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,340
and make sure that somebody's taking

567
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,860
good notes about what's happening so if

568
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,240
you're doing this remotely you could

569
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,160
potentially record it but either way you

570
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,539
need somebody who's doing rating and

571
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:09,179
recording if you're using collateral

572
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,740
like documents make sure they're

573
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,440
distributed the logistics of this aren't

574
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,720
super complex but if you don't do these

575
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,900
things it'll be a little uncomfortable

576
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,600
here's some gotchas that you're going to

577
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,980
run into whether you run your own

578
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,840
tabletop or you bring somebody in to

579
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,280
help you these things are going to

580
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,919
happen okay and it's okay it's okay it's

581
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,380
all right first of all don't get caught

582
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,140
up in minutia you will go down rabbit

583
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,000
holes you'll get an argument over

584
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
whether page 3B of your appendix of your

585
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,440
incident response plan should be

586
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,380
switched to 2A or should we really call

587
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,360
Bob if he's on vacation you know like

588
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,919
you will go down rabbit holes and you'll

589
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,660
waste your entire exercise doing that

590
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,000
and you don't want to do that okay you

591
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,980
want to gently try to keep your players

592
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,480
on track a little bit that's why you

593
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,580
have the timeline and the index but you

594
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,559
don't want to push them really hard

595
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,080
either you want to you know let them

596
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,700
fail if they're going to fail let them

597
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,440
fail a little bit that's how you learn

598
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,660
this is a safe environment nobody's

599
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,100
actually going to get hurt no

600
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,660
catastrophes are really going to happen

601
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:12,660
you know don't don't get too caught up

602
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,580
in everything happening exactly like you

603
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,600
planned it

604
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,400
and you can decide when to give them a

605
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,900
hint if they're really getting stuck if

606
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,880
things are not proceeding if they're not

607
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,380
going to make it to the next inject okay

608
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,179
yeah you can absolutely give them a hint

609
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,100
as a facilitator but you need to make

610
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,900
careful decisions about that that can be

611
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,280
a little challenging again your players

612
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,780
are not going to do what you expect and

613
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,120
that's fine in the end the point of this

614
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,700
all is to educate your team and make

615
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,200
them feel better and more confident

616
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,240
about doing incident response in a real

617
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,320
crisis

618
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,480
so make sure everybody's chill about

619
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,880
this again they you might be doing some

620
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,440
raiding but that's just to track your

621
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,120
progress nobody's going to get fired

622
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,280
over this it's chill you know get some

623
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,200
pizzas in if it's in person have a nice

624
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,100
lunch

625
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,900
make sure that people are relaxed and

626
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,400
know why you're playing this game no

627
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,960
it's not an audit

628
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,120
and you know be ready to improv a little

629
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,360
bit right be ready to to be chill and

630
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,340
improv things that your players do that

631
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,080
you don't expect

632
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,000
this is really different from doing it

633
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,679
okay this is this is again I do I've

634
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,140
done both it and OT incident response

635
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,299
and your OT environment is very very

636
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,160
different and that means you need to

637
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,380
have otpeople participate your tabletop

638
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,000
exercises because

639
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,160
OT decisions have to be made if you're

640
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,780
talking about containment cutting off

641
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,640
Network assets cutting off potentially

642
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,100
critical process systems those people

643
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,900
are not you you don't get to make those

644
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,640
decisions as cyber security people you

645
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,740
can advise but the people who actually

646
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,480
make those decisions decisions should

647
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,520
probably be involved in your cyber

648
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,799
security tabletop exercises

649
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,179
your tooling is going to be different

650
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,799
right you're not going to use the same

651
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,720
forensics tools on your lower level

652
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,000
devices or your legacy devices

653
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,480
your systems may be less known to your

654
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,980
incident response team as well your

655
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,200
cyber security Personnel so

656
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,299
expect things to be different expect

657
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,400
different issues to come up during this

658
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,320
play safety issues are going to come up

659
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,120
can you go in and do forensics on these

660
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,740
systems when there's a potential process

661
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,780
issue are you going to be able to do

662
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,240
that on site can you get in there do you

663
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,980
have the right PPE all those things are

664
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,020
going to come up in play

665
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,159
um you're gonna have different plans and

666
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,900
playbooks so

667
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,460
really and there's going to be a heavy

668
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,340
focus on containing the issue and making

669
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,200
sure that things are safe and you're

670
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,299
restoring service over Enterprise where

671
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:28,980
you might have the luxury of doing a lot

672
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,840
of forensics right away

673
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,520
you might need to get your process up

674
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,980
and running safely immediately that may

675
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,440
be your top priority so understanding

676
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
those distinctions and priorities

677
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,640
Technologies Etc are an important thing

678
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,380
you get out of doing these tabletops and

679
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,919
this is going to arise as you play

680
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,840
some stuff that's going to go wrong for

681
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,159
sure you're going to run into this

682
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,240
you're going to get players who fight

683
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,559
the scenario and you're going to have to

684
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,820
calm them down

685
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,380
you're also going to be really

686
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,880
uncomfortable because people are going

687
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,500
to go off on their tangents to the bar

688
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,880
with the wizard and you're going to be

689
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,380
like come back you need to do the

690
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,240
network containment like you're going to

691
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,100
have to be gently guide them let them

692
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,320
fail but give them gentle guidance to

693
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,940
keep them on track

694
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,440
you're not going to be totally prepared

695
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,000
and that's fine you might not have

696
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,440
people's complete attention especially

697
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,000
if they're remote and that's challenging

698
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,820
too and your scenario night might not be

699
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,220
exactly realistic or accurate and that's

700
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,900
okay too

701
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,159
um you might not have the right person

702
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:25,260
there you just have to adapt and

703
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,000
overcome really that's that's the be all

704
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,340
end all there adapt and overcome you're

705
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,860
playing a game it's safe it's okay but

706
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,120
this stuff is going to happen you're

707
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,159
going to have a management call away

708
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,659
somebody who's really critical to the

709
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:37,919
exercise and you might have to step in

710
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,140
and improv and pretend to be them that

711
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,120
stuff is going to happen it's okay it

712
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,559
happens to everybody it happens to

713
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,120
people like me who do these exercises

714
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,539
professionally it's all right

715
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:50,460
you'll want to measure your success so

716
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,320
you'll want to quantify your success in

717
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,700
some manner it could be based on

718
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,500
people's success at different stages of

719
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,840
incident response like P curl it could

720
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,880
also be on time to recover your business

721
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,220
continuity you'll need to choose some

722
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,140
criteria that you measure your exercises

723
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,400
against

724
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,900
and you'll want to keep doing these

725
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,659
exercises a lot you want to do them at

726
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,059
regular intervals like any other safety

727
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:14,039
exercise you have to drill drill drill

728
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,840
so when it happens at 2 am on Christmas

729
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,200
you are ready and in those exercises you

730
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,059
want to focus on different elements and

731
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,799
stakeholder groups make sure everybody's

732
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,960
involved and you'll want to focus on

733
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,640
different critical scenarios different

734
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,159
worst days ever

735
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,440
so some final thoughts here you should

736
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,179
go home and plan a TTX it's really

737
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,400
really really important with some basic

738
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,500
caveats about maturity you should be

739
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,419
doing a TTX if you're not ready to do it

740
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,100
yourself bring in an organization to

741
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,059
help you

742
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,159
and consider this full life cycle I

743
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,380
expressed of what goes into it but you

744
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,299
can totally do it just figure out how

745
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,220
you're going to measure success don't

746
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,500
worry about it being perfect you're just

747
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,419
you're just playing a game it's just a

748
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,760
game it's fun have some pizza and

749
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,380
document everything you do so you can do

750
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,780
better next time

751
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,940
so thank you everybody if anybody has

752
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,860
any questions I would love it if you

753
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,179
could come up and use the microphone

754
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:07,799
right here so that it gets on the

755
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,960
recording that'd be very helpful but I

756
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,400
would love to answer any questions you

757
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,100
have for my quick elevator pitch on how

758
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,919
to do tabletop exercises

759
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:18,539
or Dungeons and Dragons you can ask me

760
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,039
questions about Dungeons and Dragons too

761
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,539
I don't mind

762
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,580
given your experience

763
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,900
um an incident response real life

764
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,880
incident response what would you think

765
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,820
the most too common well uh initial

766
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,760
access vectors you see that should be

767
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,380
included if you're you're kind of baby

768
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,240
stepping into this so it's based on

769
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,120
reality and then uh I'm kind of curious

770
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,220
after that what are the most obvious

771
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,659
systems you'd want to be able to do

772
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,480
incident response or or forensics on

773
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,220
that are involved with those two

774
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,020
scenarios it depends a lot on the

775
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,700
architecture of the environment but I

776
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,620
can tell you the three most common types

777
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,020
of incidents that we respond to so the

778
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,059
first one is Insider threat cases both

779
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,279
unintentional and intentional so people

780
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,320
doing things maliciously or people who

781
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,000
just really want to watch Netflix in the

782
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,380
process environment at three in the

783
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,460
morning

784
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,279
and then the second one of course is

785
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,799
commodity malware so ransomware you just

786
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,240
get swept up in a campaign your

787
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,039
credentials get reused they get dumped

788
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,659
on the dark web and you're just part of

789
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,940
the big money making campaign and the

790
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,260
third one of course is the advanced

791
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,059
adversaries either intentional because

792
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,559
they're doing foothold building or

793
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,360
reconnaissance or because they want to

794
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,620
test out their attack and they think

795
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,179
nobody's looking at your your small

796
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,240
organization so all those things happen

797
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,100
I hope that gives you some food the

798
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,539
thought for thought about initial access

799
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,520
vectors you know thinking about those

800
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,200
three types of cases and how they could

801
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,760
potentially happen in your OT

802
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,919
environment how they actually get in is

803
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,140
going to depend a lot on do you really

804
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
have a pretty decent

805
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,900
DMZ going on how full of holes is your

806
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,240
DMZ you know do you have a really do you

807
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,500
follow the Purdue model pretty

808
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,760
accurately do you have proper

809
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,980
segmentation is it one big flat Network

810
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,539
I mean that's going to change things a

811
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,940
lot so I hope that gives you some ideas

812
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,620
about about where you might want to

813
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,020
focus in your own environment

814
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,620
what else

815
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,960
um can you

816
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,700
can you like the maturity model of

817
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,760
exercises within an organization and

818
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,220
maybe they do one and then they're like

819
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,960
oh this was really rough and then they

820
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,240
don't do anything for six months but can

821
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,799
you talk a little bit about the maturity

822
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,620
curve for organizations who do this on

823
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,200
an ongoing basis you will at your first

824
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,720
exercise your very first tabletop you

825
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,400
are going to learn so much it will be

826
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,960
drinking from a fire hose and I talked

827
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,340
really briefly and I only had a few

828
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,900
minutes but some of the things that will

829
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,520
go wrong they just will go wrong your

830
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,779
players will go in a different direction

831
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,880
management won't be totally bought in

832
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,159
you'll be missing people people who get

833
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,659
distracted all those things are going to

834
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,000
happen but still you're going to learn a

835
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,380
lot about your organization you're going

836
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,000
to reach up inject in your in your

837
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,980
exercise where you're like

838
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,500
do we have a firewall there does it have

839
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,140
logs do we have any monitoring or

840
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,580
visibility we don't know how to do

841
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,799
forensics on that who has access to that

842
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,419
system all those things are going to

843
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,580
come up as you play so your your

844
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,679
increase in maturity is going to be

845
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,200
drastic after your first decent honest

846
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,080
bottom tabletop exercise it's really

847
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,700
going to help you I promise I'm not

848
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,740
trying to sell you anything

849
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,260
thank you why hello there

850
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,779
thanks for the talk sir so my question

851
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,980
was about metrics used to you know score

852
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,440
the incident responders especially you

853
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,600
know as this is a repeated activity what

854
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,039
are kind of preferred metrics and I

855
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:33,840
heard you use the term P curl what's

856
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,299
that yes so P curl is one of the life

857
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,799
cycle models and you know academic

858
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,360
models are academic models they're

859
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,740
they're like the Purdue model like

860
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,240
they're they're okay they're not really

861
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,760
realistic for everything but P curl is

862
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,440
one of the models that describes the

863
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,299
life cycle for incident response from

864
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,039
preparation to Lessons Learned and

865
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,220
concludes containment recovery Etc so

866
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,840
you're breaking your incident response

867
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,600
efforts into stages and then you can

868
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,820
look at each stage in an independent

869
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,640
Focus so how did you do on containment

870
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,919
were you able to contain the threat were

871
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,480
you able to keep the adversary from

872
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,400
infecting more computers or doing more

873
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,580
bad stuff and for Recovery how fast

874
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,320
could you potentially get your systems

875
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,299
up and running again so that's one way

876
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,400
that you can engage success is look at

877
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,899
those incident response stages but like

878
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,820
I mentioned you could also measure time

879
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,100
to recovery from a business continuity

880
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,600
planning perspective you're supposed to

881
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,820
have a certain amount of uptime that's a

882
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,080
perfectly good way to do it too it's

883
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,700
going to depend on your environment and

884
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,919
how you want to measure success great

885
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,820
thank you of course

886
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,320
I don't know if I'm getting cut off in

887
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,580
questions this might be the last one we

888
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,140
have time for but I'm happy to talk to

889
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,880
people in the hallway afterwards thank

890
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,380
you of course

891
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,840
I'm just curious if forensics is ever

892
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,620
successful in OT and given devices give

893
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,380
it an incident I just pretend to do this

894
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,600
no no really it is it is

895
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,380
um

896
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,659
um yes we do quite a lot of forensics in

897
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:01,440
OT

898
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,020
um at the higher levels systems are

899
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,059
pretty familiar a lot of Windows out

900
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:07,860
there a lot of Legacy Windows you have

901
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,000
to be able to go back and do like

902
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,039
forensics on Windows NT which is a

903
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,120
different challenge a lot of people

904
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,700
never learned how to do that but for the

905
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,039
low level devices yes you can absolutely

906
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,380
do forensics on them you have to learn a

907
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,940
lot about the system so you have to kind

908
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,380
of reverse engineer it you have to

909
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,820
reverse engineer it from a physical

910
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,679
perspective so what's the interface you

911
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,679
have to build a plug and then what does

912
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:30,600
it actually log a lot of them do have

913
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,640
some pretty good Telemetry in them some

914
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,899
of them have logging it depends on the

915
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,640
system the vendor what they desire and

916
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,919
you just have to find that out some of

917
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,539
the systems are better documented than

918
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:43,919
others you know some of the

919
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,720
organizations out there really did

920
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,760
document where they log things for the

921
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,220
sake of Diagnostics but other things are

922
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,960
old or they're undocumented and you're

923
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,820
digging through them to try to find if

924
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,679
there's anything useful on them now

925
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,120
there's stuff like historian data too

926
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,679
which can be very useful for forensics

927
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,659
that's on it's a little bit different

928
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,279
from I.T because you're suddenly looking

929
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,980
at process data so what happened to the

930
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,720
process but that can be very relevant to

931
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,760
forensics too so yes we do lots of

932
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,080
forensics on both high level and

933
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,000
low-level devices in industrial networks

934
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,039
and it can be challenging it's very

935
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,659
different than doing Enterprise

936
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:18,120
forensics where you maybe have agents I

937
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,159
mean there's there's uh there's no

938
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,679
next-gen EDR in your in most of your OT

939
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,299
environments so you don't have that

940
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,039
luxury and what people are used to in

941
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,080
cyber security today you have to do

942
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,299
manual old school forensics sometimes on

943
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:31,919
very old systems

944
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,919
foreign
