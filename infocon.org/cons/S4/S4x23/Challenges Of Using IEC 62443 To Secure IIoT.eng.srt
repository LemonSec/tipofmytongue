1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,679
just making sure that you're all in the

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,980
right room this is the session on 62443

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,079
and iiot

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,560
okay

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,240
so welcome to this session uh I'm Ryan

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,000
de Souza and I'm a principal Solutions

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,880
architect at AWS it's a real pleasure to

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,700
be with you all here today and the topic

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
I'm going to discuss is 62443 and how to

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,980
apply it to iiot or the industrial

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,559
Internet of Things uh in this session

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,559
we'll be going over some of the changes

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,660
in the standards as well as the

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,520
certifications we've got really a lot of

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,480
content to cover uh so let's get started

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,879
so as most of you know or most of you

18
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,640
are aware industrial iot is used across

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,680
Industries

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,940
and uh

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,680
these are some of the industries that

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,339
it's it's used in it gets introduced

23
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,900
into the OT environment so industrial

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,100
iot or iiot devices integrate into the

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,740
OT environment and you do that when you

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,580
implement industrial iot use cases

27
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,100
throughout the stock today I will be

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,840
discussing and talking about

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
OT devices as well as I iot devices and

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,900
just to level set when I mention OT

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,960
devices I mean traditional OT devices

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,280
like plcs hmis scada systems when I

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,100
mentioned I iot devices I mean modern

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,640
iiot devices like IP based cameras

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,619
secondary sensors as well as Edge

36
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,880
gateways these iiot devices get

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,799
introduced into the OT environment when

38
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,840
you implement industrial iot use cases

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,119
so what are these industrial iot use

40
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,100
cases here are some of them it's

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,020
improving operational efficiencies in

42
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,780
the factory okay reducing unplanned

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,479
downtime with predictive maintenance

44
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,340
improving product quality

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,440
supply chain improvements in Supply

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,680
Chain management as well as creating new

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
Revenue opportunities for manufacturers

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,560
with smart products and services

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,660
let's go ahead and take the take a look

50
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,580
at the evolving manufacturing data

51
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,680
landscape and I've tried to lay this out

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,400
based on Isa 95 and based on three

53
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,220
different time zones okay so the first

54
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,020
time zone we'll take a look at is

55
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,459
yesterday

56
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,980
in yesterday's world you had asset

57
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,200
owners that implemented the traditional

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,500
para model or Isa 95 model OKAY in this

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,480
model you had Standalone applications

60
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,700
you had data silos very little

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,440
connectivity between the different

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,319
layers and few connections to external

63
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,540
networks right so that's the yesterday

64
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,060
scenario let's go ahead and take a look

65
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,280
at what's happening today and tomorrow

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
in the today tomorrow time frame

67
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,739
what we have over here is the

68
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,080
introduction of iiot so the ongoing

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,420
convergence of OT and it and the

70
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,300
introduction of industrial iot into the

71
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,640
OT landscape what is also happening is

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
that in the same way that the cloud

73
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,800
transformed the I.T landscape the cloud

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,260
is transforming and revolutionizing OT

75
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,379
in new ways in what is called industrial

76
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:30,679
digital transformation or industry 4.0

77
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,420
what's going to happen in the future is

78
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,459
even more convergence continued

79
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,340
convergence of 40 and it okay I would

80
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,560
say full convergence of otnit with any

81
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,840
to any Communications in this scenario

82
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,060
you have digital factories and smart

83
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,580
factories this trend is going to

84
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,920
continue this trend is going to

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,739
accelerate there's nothing stopping this

86
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,799
from happening uh what is slowing this

87
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,099
down is security right so security is

88
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,260
one of the factors that is slowing down

89
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,819
this transition towards a full

90
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:05,760
convergence and uh understandably so

91
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,519
because asset owners need to secure

92
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,959
OT when doing iiot and Cloud projects so

93
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,780
this convergence of otnit introduces new

94
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,918
opportunities

95
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,220
for manufacturers for industrial digital

96
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,139
transformation for industry for a door

97
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,560
but it also introduces new risk which

98
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,800
needs to be properly managed okay if you

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,960
look at this this architecture over here

100
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,199
it is drawn out to the ISA 95 model what

101
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,320
iiot introduces is new connections so

102
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,479
you can have iiot devices at different

103
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,000
layers of the stack establishing

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,340
connections to external networks or

105
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,440
untrusted networks and when this happens

106
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,860
you increase the attack surface okay so

107
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,720
this introduces new risk into the

108
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,580
environment which asset owners need to

109
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,320
be aware of and need to be able to

110
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,440
protect the full attack surface

111
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,259
so let's go ahead and look at the iiot

112
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,620
threat vectors these threat vectors are

113
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,320
not unique to iiot but they do exist

114
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,199
with the industrial internet of things

115
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,199
okay and essentially an iiot device can

116
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,180
get compromised or may be compromised

117
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,759
and may be then used for a denial of

118
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,199
service attack

119
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,900
an iiot device can lead to lateral

120
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,940
threat escalation on the network

121
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,100
it can lead to surveillance of the

122
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,120
network

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,400
an iiot device can lead to sabotage

124
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,039
attacks on operational technology

125
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,660
some of these devices are pretty

126
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,280
powerful right some of these Edge

127
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,100
Computers are powerful devices and if

128
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,840
compromised they can be used for

129
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,960
cryptocurrency mining activities

130
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
lastly the data on the device or the

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,500
date on the edge Gateway can get

132
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,960
encrypted leading to a ransomware attack

133
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,720
okay or you could have data that is

134
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,600
being exfiltrated from the factory once

135
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,060
again these threat vectors are not

136
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,820
unique to iiot what is different is that

137
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,560
these devices when introduced into the

138
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,780
OT environment significantly increase

139
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,000
the attack surface which needs to be

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,220
protected the consequences of a

141
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,900
compromise is also what is different

142
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,539
because if there is a compromise it can

143
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,180
have environment health and safety

144
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,180
implications as you're well aware

145
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,580
so I'll give you a second to read uh

146
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,639
this view of little Bob that or what

147
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,740
little Bobby has on the six two four

148
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,730
four three standards

149
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,980
[Music]

150
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,860
uh so what I am going to add is that uh

151
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,720
62443 is comprehensive

152
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,660
it's a comprehensive set of Standards it

153
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,380
also uh is consensus based and it can

154
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,060
actually run into thousands of pages

155
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,340
right thousands of pages of guidance

156
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,199
which makes reading all of this a

157
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,319
challenge

158
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:59,639
in order to level set on 62443 and the

159
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,740
standards uh so that we are all on the

160
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,080
same page it is a series of security

161
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,720
standards for Industrial Automation and

162
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,180
control systems it was jointly developed

163
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,960
and supported and managed by Isa and IEC

164
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,440
and therefore it's called Isa

165
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,360
iec62443 standards

166
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,400
it is structured into different groups

167
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,319
and you can see the groups of years you

168
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,840
have a general category you've got uh

169
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,660
policies and procedures components as

170
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,699
well as system

171
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,280
uh it is important to note that these

172
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,280
standards predate iiot right so they

173
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,340
were written before iiot uh you know

174
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,000
came into existence and therefore iiot

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,900
is not already represented in 62443 that

176
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,400
needs to change and that's one of the

177
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,479
challenges

178
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,340
so let's go ahead and take a look at the

179
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,759
the challenges uh with using 62443 for

180
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,340
the industrial Internet of Things the

181
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,500
first is that it predates iiot so it

182
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,500
came basically before iiot and therefore

183
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,819
you know the standards need to be

184
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,919
updated

185
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,139
um iiot introduces new communication

186
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,720
channels into the OT environment but

187
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,000
also brings in lots of new functionality

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
which asset owners can take advantage of

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,080
uh there are different roles in 62443 so

190
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,479
there is the asset owner role uh there

191
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,099
is the product supplier role there's

192
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,500
also a service provider role there is no

193
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,020
formal role for the cloud provider okay

194
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,479
so that needs to change a recognition

195
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,000
that a cloud provider can play a role in

196
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,419
62443 in the iiot environment uh and and

197
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,919
that's one of the changes that needs to

198
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
happen many of the requirements that

199
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,320
62443 has or does actually apply to

200
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,800
Cloud providers okay so it's not that so

201
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,120
there are some changes that need to be

202
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,800
made but many of the requirements

203
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,040
already apply to a cloud provider

204
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,100
uh six two four four three considers a

205
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,140
segmented environment so it considers

206
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,180
the segmentation it considers this

207
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,940
parameter-based security guess what when

208
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,680
you have iiot and you have these

209
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,660
connections coming in

210
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,480
um from that iiot introduces into the OT

211
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,860
environment and if you look at the

212
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,540
Purdue model you've got these

213
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,339
connections to external networks and

214
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,279
untrusted networks okay uh so Network

215
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,660
segmentation

216
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,880
is important but parameter-based

217
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,160
security alone is not sufficient you

218
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,839
really need to get into a zero trust

219
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,940
security model because now you have

220
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,700
these incremental connections uh that

221
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,100
are different layers of the OT stack

222
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,839
that have connections to external

223
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,380
untrusted Networks uh iiot upsets the

224
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,180
traditional para model and we took a

225
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,680
look at that in one of my earlier slides

226
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,839
where I showed you a different layers of

227
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,580
the Purdue model you can have iot

228
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,620
devices making connections to external

229
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,839
untrusted Networks

230
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,940
so what's actually changing in the

231
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,980
standards uh this is one of the

232
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,200
important changes that you will see to

233
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,620
the standard it is uh the TR or

234
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,180
technical report six to four four three

235
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,120
four dash three this was jointly created

236
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,360
and published by Isa 99 working group

237
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,180
nine I'm part of that committee and they

238
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,680
published this technical report it's

239
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,880
called 62443 4-3 it's also available as

240
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,980
an iecpas 62443 4-3 it is yet in draft

241
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,080
so it is not yet part of the standards

242
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,760
but it will be

243
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,000
uh it discusses the application of 62443

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,240
to iiot and in my view it's a great

245
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,760
document for asset owners because it

246
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,500
provides asset owners with prescriptive

247
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,100
guidance on introducing iiot into OT

248
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,519
environments and yet following the 62443

249
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,839
security standards

250
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,220
security Concepts like zones and

251
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,920
conduits have a new meaning for iiot and

252
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,839
we'll take a look at that momentarily

253
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,940
there is a section in the document that

254
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,440
has that talks about the special

255
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,620
considerations of using iiot with

256
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,200
cloud-based services

257
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,839
the document has no normative content so

258
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,360
there are no obligations and also this

259
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,760
document has got guidance but no

260
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,620
technical requirements the technical

261
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,660
requirements have not yet been written

262
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,940
and and that's one of the ongoing works

263
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,220
for the standards

264
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,680
so we'll now transition and take a look

265
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,500
at using Zone and conduit models uh

266
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,760
those of you in the room that have used

267
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,880
62443 this should not be a surprise

268
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,279
these are Zone and conduit diagrams they

269
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
follow six to four four three three-2

270
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,260
for risk assessments this is a really

271
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,880
simple example where I have a secondary

272
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,339
sensor connected to in the OT

273
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,019
environment connected to an asset so it

274
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,399
could be a temperature sensor or a

275
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,860
vibration sensor it is connected to an

276
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,220
industrial iot Gateway this gateway then

277
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,899
establishes a connection to an external

278
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:50,760
network or an untrusted Network like the

279
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,160
internet in order to get out get

280
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,980
connected to cloud services running

281
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,560
remotely okay so this is really a simple

282
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,200
use case in this use case we're using

283
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,240
the zone and conduit model so you've got

284
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,680
different zones you've got the local

285
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,200
Zone you've got an edge Zone and you can

286
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
have multiple trust zones in the cloud

287
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,360
as you can see right over here

288
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,880
uh this Zone and conduit model diagrams

289
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,540
are very useful even for industrial iot

290
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,540
use cases in order to understand threats

291
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,600
and vulnerabilities right in order to in

292
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,880
order to then inform your risk as well

293
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,279
as understanding consequences

294
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,560
so we briefly spoke about this earlier

295
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,100
that 62443 has got standards uh has got

296
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,220
sorry roles these roles are the acetona

297
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,380
role the product supplier role the

298
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,600
service provider role there is no role

299
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,240
for cloud provider okay and the cloud

300
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,579
provider can actually play multiple

301
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,620
roles multiple of the multiple existing

302
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,579
roles that 62443 has so for example uh

303
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:54,779
the cloud provider can be a product

304
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,880
supplier why is that because cloud

305
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,800
services is the product

306
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,720
uh the cloud provider can also be a

307
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,639
maintenance service provider and why is

308
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,019
that because the cloud provider

309
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,899
maintains cloud services and in some

310
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,760
cases the cloud provider can even be a

311
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,800
system integrator if the cloud provider

312
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,940
is playing the role of a system

313
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,639
integrator on an iiot project

314
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,860
so these are the changes that need to

315
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,660
happen in the standards in order to

316
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,459
recognize that there is a cloud provider

317
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,440
and the cloud provider does play a role

318
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,540
on iiot projects and related with 62443

319
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,860
so when asset owners do use iiot and

320
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,899
introduce iiot into their OT

321
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,240
environments uh there's always going to

322
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,220
be cloud services

323
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,079
so it's important for the asset owner to

324
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,240
understand what is called the shared

325
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,120
responsibility model for the cloud so

326
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,700
what is the shared responsibility model

327
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,560
essentially it is defined as security of

328
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,139
the cloud versus Security in the cloud

329
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,720
okay so the cloud provider is

330
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,579
responsible for security off the cloud

331
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:59,339
and the asset owner is responsible for

332
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,800
security in the cloud what does that

333
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,880
mean exactly

334
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,339
so this is another view of what I just

335
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,560
mentioned where the cloud provider is

336
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,300
responsible for the cloud infrastructure

337
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,300
right the data centers the services the

338
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,100
cloud infrastructure that's the cloud

339
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,740
provider's responsibility to secure that

340
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,920
part of the solution the asset owner on

341
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,120
the other hand is responsible for

342
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,639
security in the cloud which means that

343
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,279
they are applications okay they are OT

344
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,440
and iot applications that they place in

345
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,120
the cloud security for those

346
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,100
applications and security of that data

347
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,680
is the responsibility of the asset owner

348
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,720
the cloud provider does provide a lot of

349
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,940
Security Services as well as

350
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,160
prescriptive guidance in order to help

351
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,500
the asset owner with their part of the

352
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,060
responsibility

353
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,519
in addition to that the cloud provider

354
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,800
is continuously monitoring and achieving

355
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,199
third-party validation for literally

356
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,000
thousands of different

357
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,980
compliance requirements security

358
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,139
compliance requirements and the asset

359
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,820
owner can take advantage of all of that

360
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,980
okay because the asset owner inherits

361
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,899
those security controls that are

362
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,180
operated by the cloud provider

363
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,199
so we talked about the Purdue model and

364
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:18,480
how the Purdue model gets upset I do

365
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,279
want to mention that the Purdue model is

366
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,160
yet very useful okay and this is an

367
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,940
example of using the Purdue model with

368
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,680
industrial internet of things with

369
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,480
Industrial Automation and control

370
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,959
systems and uh this is the iiot security

371
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:36,600
architecture it is aligned and it is

372
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,300
based on the Purdue model you can see

373
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,920
the different layers or levels of the

374
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,959
model at the bottom so you've got level

375
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,500
zero one two and three zero one two and

376
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,540
three that's part of the OT Network or

377
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,880
the operational technology network if we

378
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,220
take a look at that I actually have some

379
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,220
details in this architecture which is

380
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,459
shown in in different cells so in the

381
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,740
top cell you've got plcs or industrial

382
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,260
automation systems that support insecure

383
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,000
protocols and in this security

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
architecture we're converting the

385
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,139
insecure protocol to a secure protocol

386
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,480
right so taking like modbus or ethernet

387
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,639
IP and converting it to a secure

388
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,000
protocol like OPC UA or mqtt and doing

389
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,300
that as close to the source as possible

390
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,579
I have a second cell there and in that

391
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,500
second cell if you notice I have a data

392
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,680
diode or a unidirectional Gateway in

393
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,779
order to Able so that you can get data

394
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:32,699
out of that cell without allowing

395
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,980
anything to go into that cell

396
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,399
in my third cell I've got modern PLC so

397
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,139
modern Industrial Automation and control

398
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:42,720
systems that support secure protocols

399
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,100
out of the box

400
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,440
under the last cell at the bottom is an

401
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,320
iiot device in the OT Network that

402
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,560
supports secure protocols like mqtt

403
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,100
between layer 3 and layer 4 I I'm

404
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,040
crossing the otit network boundary so

405
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,139
level four and level five is ITN cloud

406
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,899
between level three and four I cross the

407
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,579
otit network boundary and I've

408
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,240
introduced an idmz or an industrial

409
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,160
demilitarized zone which can inspect all

410
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,799
the traffic going northbound as well as

411
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,439
southbound you can establish there are

412
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,760
different ways to establish secure

413
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,220
connectivity to cloud services you can

414
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,459
see on the top you can go over a VPN

415
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,679
connection so you can have side to side

416
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,780
VPN you can have a private connection or

417
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,280
Direct Connect

418
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,640
in addition in the center uh you can

419
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,200
have uh you can go over the public

420
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,480
internet in order to connect to cloud

421
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
services on the cloud side you've got

422
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,679
different services that can ingest data

423
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,500
manage devices store data and build

424
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,020
industrial iot applications in addition

425
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,820
to that the cloud provider provides

426
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,760
Security Services in order to secure the

427
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,620
edge the industrial Edge and the cloud

428
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,480
so in the technical report 62443 4-3

429
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,400
there is a section in that report which

430
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,140
talks about

431
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,419
the security capability is that cloud

432
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,640
providers can provide okay so when

433
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,380
implementing industrial iot use cases

434
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,559
the asset owner can take advantage of

435
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,480
different security capabilities provided

436
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,760
by the cloud provider what are some of

437
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,100
these capabilities so you have connected

438
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,380
asset inventory to manage your assets

439
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,660
your connected assets and iiot devices

440
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,140
you have identity and access control so

441
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,000
the cloud provider provides mechanisms

442
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,580
that every device every iot device is

443
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,400
given a unique identity with an x.509

444
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
certificate and you can manage

445
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,600
fine-grained policies using iot policies

446
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,120
in addition to that the cloud provider

447
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,720
provides mechanisms in order to generate

448
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,360
rotate and revocate credentials for your

449
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,340
iiot devices

450
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,380
patching and software updates is super

451
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,600
important and critical for iiot devices

452
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,760
and these are capabilities and services

453
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
for over-the-air updates

454
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,740
securing The Edge Gateway so in iiot

455
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,419
you'll always have an industrial Edge

456
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,000
that consolidates the data pre-processes

457
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,860
the data and then sends it off to the

458
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,960
cloud so you've got to secure the

459
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,120
industrial Edge you've got to secure the

460
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,860
edge Gateway and you've got to secure

461
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,620
the credentials on the edge Gateway

462
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,360
uh there are different ways as I

463
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,500
mentioned to establish secure

464
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,020
connections to cloud services as well as

465
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,000
secure remote access to on-prem

466
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,120
resources you go to encrypt data both at

467
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,280
rest as well as in transit and the cloud

468
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,960
provider provides services to encrypt

469
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,720
your data at the edge in transit in the

470
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
cloud

471
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,559
alerting and monitoring across the full

472
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,880
attack surface

473
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,059
as well as alerting and mitigation the

474
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,280
ability to create a security data Lake

475
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,039
in the cloud and security analytics in

476
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,660
the cloud can be provided by the cloud

477
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,240
provider and last but not the least is

478
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,720
backup and recovery of OT data and iiot

479
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,539
data in the cloud so the cloud provider

480
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:57,000
provides lots of different Services very

481
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,039
useful for asset owners to take

482
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,620
advantage of when building and securing

483
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,580
industrial iot applications at scale

484
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,320
foreign

485
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,500
so let's transition to Let's transition

486
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
to certifications so Isa secure is the

487
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,340
certification Institute for 62443 uh and

488
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,220
with that we've got the first iiot

489
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,280
certification that is available today it

490
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,820
is the icsa certification or the iiot

491
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,919
component security Assurance

492
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,419
certification

493
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:33,419
it is for iiot devices so these include

494
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:35,760
iiot sensors they could be temperature

495
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,280
sensors vibration sensor any iot device

496
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,380
that establishes a direct connectivity

497
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,320
to cloud services or it could be an edge

498
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,600
Gateway that consolidates data from

499
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,940
multiple devices processes the data at

500
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,620
the edge and then sends it to the cloud

501
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,860
so if you have any of these devices an

502
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,220
iiot sensor or an iot device or an iiot

503
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,980
Gateway you can take advantage of this

504
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,480
certification that's available today

505
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,740
okay by Isa secure

506
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,660
getting into some details on the

507
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,400
certification it is for devices and

508
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,380
gateways there are two certification

509
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,539
tiers you have the code here as well as

510
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,720
the advanced tier it is based on 4-1 and

511
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,660
4-2 which is the component grouping of

512
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,700
standards

513
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,940
um it does have extensions as well as

514
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,860
exceptions in terms of extensions it

515
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,440
provides the ability for

516
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,200
compartmentalization on the device

517
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,280
um

518
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,260
controlling software updates so these

519
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,940
devices need to have the ability to

520
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,159
control and manage software updates

521
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,520
secure remote access to the device

522
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,320
uh strong methods of authentication

523
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,960
using pki and we talked about x.509

524
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,700
certificates earlier as well as

525
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,480
component resilience of to DDOS attacks

526
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,940
there is also a requirement for security

527
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,640
maintenance audit in order to maintain

528
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,159
your certifications it's important to

529
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,020
note that this certification the

530
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,059
component certification does not include

531
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,460
does not incorporate and does not have

532
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,700
in it cloud services okay so for cloud

533
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,679
services we've got the system

534
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,780
certification the system certification

535
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,600
is yet work in progress it is again

536
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,179
going to be based on

537
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:22,919
um 4-1 3-3 as well as 2-4 it's going to

538
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,159
consider iiot use cases so one type of I

539
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,280
iot use case is data being sent to the

540
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,100
cloud for visualization and analytics a

541
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,659
second type of use case could be a

542
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:35,280
closed loop use case where you have

543
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,440
command and control from the cloud down

544
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,539
to on-prem resources yeah so this

545
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,340
certification the system certification

546
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,860
is going to consider industrial iot use

547
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,260
cases most of the requirements that

548
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,020
62443 has does apply to Cloud providers

549
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,419
as I mentioned earlier and risk

550
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:52,980
assessment and Zone and conduit models

551
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,720
can be used we took a look at that

552
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,480
earlier when I showed you a simple iiot

553
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,640
use case which used the zone and conduit

554
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,059
model

555
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,440
so these are the two certifications the

556
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,659
the component certification and the

557
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,520
system certification which is yet a work

558
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,860
in progress

559
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,820
so finally and I'm almost out of time

560
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,520
I'd like to end by saying that

561
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,080
uh 62443 right in terms of

562
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,539
uh in terms of the standards

563
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,940
there's a lot in there that can support

564
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,240
industrial iot use cases okay uh it

565
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,919
really provides a strong Foundation

566
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,400
there's no need to start over 62443 can

567
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,039
be reused and built upon right and and

568
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,260
the required iot requirements can be

569
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,299
added four six two four four three to

570
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:46,020
support industrial iot use cases a new

571
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,400
interpretation of six to four for three

572
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,679
concepts is needed uh the new

573
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,600
requirements that need to be added to

574
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,480
the 62443 standards and specifically the

575
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,260
sections 4-1 4-2 3-3 and 2-4

576
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,100
it's important to note that the

577
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,539
technical report that is published and

578
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,340
the feedback that is received that's

579
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,679
going to provide valuable inputs to the

580
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,000
different committees and the different

581
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,039
working groups in order to go and create

582
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,260
the technical requirements okay that

583
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,299
then finally get added and incorporated

584
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,700
into the standards uh these

585
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,220
certifications Isa secure certification

586
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,159
and Ice certifications need to be

587
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:25,740
updated new training materials will need

588
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,700
to be added uh related to iiot and 62443

589
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,940
and last but not the least uh my view is

590
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,440
that these standards and certification

591
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,900
bodies need to move faster because this

592
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,059
is happening industrial iot is already

593
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:42,000
used and will continue to be used in OT

594
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,520
environments because asset owners need

595
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,260
to improve and and want to improve

596
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,620
operational efficiencies as well as you

597
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,240
know ensure that these continue to stay

598
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,039
competitive

599
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,500
a couple of wrap-up slides in terms of

600
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,080
IC secure supporters you have all the

601
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,700
traditional Industrial Automation and

602
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,679
control companies but you can also see

603
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
you've got Cloud providers uh supporting

604
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,820
the ISA secure standards as you can see

605
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,460
on the top right hand side

606
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,720
foreign

607
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,059
and then finally there's lots of good

608
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,580
content and material both in terms of

609
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,179
the study reports as well as the iiot

610
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:19,260
component certification and these

611
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,900
materials are available you know on on

612
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,880
on these links and the presentation of

613
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,179
course is is available to to all of you

614
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,520
uh so with that I want to wrap it up I

615
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,279
really uh it was a pleasure to give this

616
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,020
presentation today thank you for taking

617
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,779
the time uh to attend this uh to attend

618
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,240
this this presentation I'm happy to take

619
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,159
questions now I'm going to be around for

620
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,840
the rest of the week so please find me

621
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,779
