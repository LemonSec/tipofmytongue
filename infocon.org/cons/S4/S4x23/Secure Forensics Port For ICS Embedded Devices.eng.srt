1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,120
foreign

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,099
very good afternoon to all of you so I

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,660
want to put an argument to you and I'm

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,599
hoping to turn everyone who's watching

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,920
the video and everyone in this room into

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,500
an ally for a particular idea we have

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,140
heard it said in a few different times

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,699
and locations by a couple of different

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:21,900
people

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,939
that were drowning in data

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,519
and starving for information I'm sure

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,199
some of you have heard this this is one

13
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,060
of these sayings that sounds profound on

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,579
the surface but might be pretty trite if

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,860
you think about it a little bit however

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,360
I want you to think about how it applies

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,540
to ICS and OT environments

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,940
certainly we have an abundance of

19
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,399
telemetry right and there's no shortage

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,920
of scada network traffic to look at and

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,480
monitor and analyze for defensive

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,039
purposes

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,840
but to me

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,539
is a curious Gap in our ability to

25
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,480
perceive and monitor and understand the

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,100
internal Behavior

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,800
of the OT devices that make up

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,899
the infrastructure that we have to guard

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,119
and operate

30
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,580
and so I'm not here on behalf of any

31
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,280
particular company or product but I'm

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,560
here on behalf of an idea and the group

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,600
of people you see on the slide

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,159
who've been collaborating over the past

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,439
couple of years to understand how to

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,060
illustrate to everybody the art of the

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,400
possible when it comes to helping asset

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
owners facilitate recovery from Deep

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,860
cyber intrusions

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,180
so that's what this talk is about

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,759
imagine

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,340
you're a pipeline operator who has some

43
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,140
sort of widespread ransomware on their

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,540
I.T side I know a difficult thing to to

45
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,740
conceive

46
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,979
but suspend disbelief for a moment

47
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,860
imagine the room right so imagine that

48
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,619
conference room one day in two days

49
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,799
three days five days six days when the

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,880
question

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,020
are we cyber clean is posed over and

52
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,180
over again

53
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,939
who answers this question

54
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,280
where do they get answers to the that

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,439
question right when they're being asked

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,160
what now is it safe to restart can we go

57
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,379
imagine you're the person who has to

58
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,060
provide answers and give the thumbs up

59
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,160
or the green light to that recovery

60
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,660
procedure

61
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,700
what you're seeing is uncertainty unfold

62
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,980
uncertainty in action uncertainty and

63
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,840
operation

64
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,819
and you may even have a plan

65
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,200
that's fine

66
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,300
but you need information to actually

67
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,599
decisions in the context of that plan

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,700
oh and by the way since you've

69
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,379
preemptively and proactively shut down

70
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,080
your OT and your scada network you don't

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,080
have necessarily that source of

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,239
information to drive your decision

73
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,280
making

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,160
you can even put a price on this

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
I happen to look at a finza report for a

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,739
purely physical uh petroleum leak

77
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,840
relatively small four thousand gallons

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,300
and even this costs 15 million dollars

79
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,280
to clean up right in terms of lost

80
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,800
product in terms of lost productivity

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,019
and overtime for the people to actually

82
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,000
remediate things

83
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,860
so imagine if you're dealing with that

84
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,180
but you're dealing with that in a

85
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,280
contested scada environment where

86
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,860
there's an adversary actively attacking

87
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,300
you and attempting to frustrate those

88
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,140
recovery efforts

89
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,300
before we go on I want to share a couple

90
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,200
of observations with you that I think

91
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,019
hold some lessons about how we react to

92
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,720
these kinds of scenarios

93
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,599
and when I say we I mean industry

94
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,738
government the Press

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,659
on the slide in front of you are a

96
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,580
couple of quotes I pulled one is from a

97
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,959
Wall Street Journal article discussing

98
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,400
the colonial pipeline incident and the

99
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,019
others from a finza report

100
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,620
related to the same topic

101
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,080
and what you see I think is some

102
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,640
misaligned incentives right plenty of

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,440
good intentions but misaligned

104
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,480
incentives

105
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,900
and so ta TSA initially said Hey in

106
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,480
reaction to this utilities operators

107
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,860
you've got to do a bunch of stuff one of

108
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,540
those is shrinking the the notification

109
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,360
window down to 12 hours very rapid

110
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,739
you got to let people know what's going

111
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,900
on very very quickly

112
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,180
the worm in the Apple here

113
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,918
is that the first draft of history is

114
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,459
often wrong

115
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,720
right it does no good to get people

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,759
worked up about

117
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,500
any phenomena you might choose whether

118
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,180
it's stuff flying in the sky or stuff

119
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,060
leaking on the ground without good and

120
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,280
accurate information right so you want

121
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,040
that initial report to be actionable

122
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,600
kind of intelligence not vague

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,500
speculation and not wrong

124
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,400
so you need that disclosure grounded and

125
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,080
solid evidence and good intelligence and

126
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,240
good information okay so it's good you

127
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,620
can see where the government wants to

128
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,560
encourage operators and utilities to go

129
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,720
but they don't have a way to get there

130
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,180
there's a hole there's a gap how do they

131
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,639
get that information

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,580
and as for the fimsa advice or

133
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,380
commentary which is entirely appropriate

134
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,840
about having a good plan and practicing

135
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
it I'll stipulate you may have a good

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,220
plan it may be an excellent plan

137
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,979
but we all know that a plan is not some

138
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,080
automated checklist right it's a set of

139
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,460
guidelines

140
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,740
for guiding your actions in a highly

141
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,380
Dynamic real world situation

142
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,020
it's not just an automated execution

143
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,120
and in order to drive through the plan

144
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,860
in order to step through the decisions

145
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,500
in that plan you need data

146
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,639
right

147
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,680
so where does this leave us right we

148
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
have lots of good intent but some

149
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,259
misaligned incentives and I think

150
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,120
one underlying cause of that is the

151
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,039
topic of this talk right the fact that

152
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,199
we don't really have good ways to get

153
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,479
intelligence out of the devices that

154
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,620
make up the infrastructure we're

155
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,720
protecting

156
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,120
so how do we recover and restart with

157
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,639
confidence this is the key question and

158
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,020
I think I've been making the point over

159
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,940
the last couple of slides

160
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,520
that information is essential

161
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,520
to make effective decisions

162
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,220
it's particularly important of course in

163
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,720
highly Dynamic situations like

164
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,600
recovering from Cyber attack

165
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,900
vital to know your own disposition

166
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,139
and your own posture

167
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,180
in order to make

168
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,120
the decisions between or among many

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,039
horrible options right in emergency

170
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,080
scenarios there are no good options

171
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,060
you're making the least worst decision

172
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,039
or you're choosing the least worst

173
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,000
option

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
but you have to know

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,160
what it is and what state of your

176
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,940
devices are

177
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,940
so what do we need hey technology okay

178
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,039
so we need some kind of trustworthy

179
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,520
mechanism that allows us to pull devices

180
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,800
and ascertain whether or not they're

181
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,460
cyber clean

182
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,720
that sounds good

183
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,940
I think

184
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,800
but

185
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,120
there are a couple of problems the

186
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,280
foremost among it

187
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,080
is the fact that this is not a purely

188
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,639
technological problem

189
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,259
if it were we could just say here's a

190
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,919
system fixes the problem let's walk away

191
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,960
this is an organizational problem this

192
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,880
is a people problem this is a societal

193
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,319
problem in terms of policies that govern

194
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,479
this kind of action this is a legal

195
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,680
problem

196
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,599
technical people like me don't like to

197
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,039
deal with those sort of chewy human

198
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,860
issues right

199
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,240
but if our shared goal is indeed

200
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,800
achieving resilient energy

201
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,080
infrastructure and it should be no

202
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,819
matter who we work for

203
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,199
what industry player we work for

204
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,500
utilities manufacturers government

205
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,419
if that's the goal and it has to be the

206
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:52,800
shared goal

207
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,240
then

208
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,340
we have to contend I think with two

209
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,900
other obstacles

210
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,599
the first is the acceptance of the

211
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,800
reality

212
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,740
that these IEDs contain microprocessors

213
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,440
contain CPUs microcontrollers they have

214
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,300
operating system code on them

215
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,979
and the bad guys can talk to these

216
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,319
things well so can we right we have to

217
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,900
accept this as a strength rather than

218
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,639
some kind of liability to be hidden away

219
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,759
and not shown to people

220
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,220
but the second key part of that is to

221
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,740
have an increased level of trust among

222
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,479
all of these players and this is not a

223
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,220
naive Trust

224
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,139
you don't just take stuff on faith it

225
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,419
should be somehow verifiable

226
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,799
and so in this way I'm hoping to

227
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,919
transform this chewy people problem into

228
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,539
something that technology can actually

229
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,399
help address right and so we can begin

230
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,200
to close that Gap and address these

231
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,420
demands by having

232
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,880
and promulgating designing an open

233
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,640
standard for secure access to this very

234
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,620
low level forensics information on these

235
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,620
devices and our team over the past

236
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,480
little while has done this prototype

237
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,640
this for two different devices one is a

238
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,920
gas rtu and the other is an rtac used in

239
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,500
the electric sector

240
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,720
we did this without any Aid or vendor

241
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,339
knowledge or anything like this

242
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,399
right so no special access

243
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,720
we're just showing the art of the

244
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,760
possible right so if we can do this as

245
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,680
the good guys well imagine what the bad

246
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,760
guys know about your devices

247
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,519
so I'm about to show you a flowchart

248
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,920
and it's a flowchart notional flow chart

249
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,320
of recovery workflow that one might

250
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,360
undertake to respond to such intrusions

251
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,300
and as we look at it and evaluate it

252
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,519
think about the effectiveness of that

253
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,100
particular workflow when you're faced

254
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,140
with an adversary has full access and

255
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,760
control to level zero one and two

256
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,899
devices

257
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,720
all right oh and you as the defender by

258
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,279
the way the arrows in your quiver are

259
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,560
something like push buttons and LCDs on

260
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,720
the front panel of these devices maybe

261
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,779
access to some vendor RMA

262
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,060
um assume for Simplicity of course that

263
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,380
these devices under the control of the

264
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,240
attacker are not responding to Telemetry

265
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,640
or scada control

266
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,279
so you can't operate them or diagnose

267
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,100
them in the typical ways

268
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,320
all right what you're seeing is is my

269
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,600
poor skills a drawing PowerPoint flow

270
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,959
charts but this begins with some kind of

271
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,200
serious incident in the upper left and

272
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,779
the top couple of rows are a notional

273
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,360
depiction of a utility workflow and

274
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,860
underneath that is kind of the decision

275
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,800
tree that a vendor might undergo if they

276
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,360
get involved right so I'll guide you

277
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,740
through this but the moral of the story

278
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,440
is that both of these workflows I guess

279
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,940
the argument I'm making is both of these

280
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,800
workflows are largely ineffective for

281
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,420
what we want to achieve and they kind of

282
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,880
end in that stop sign

283
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,160
so let's take the utility utility case

284
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,660
first right

285
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,120
even if the utility has some pretty

286
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,060
Savvy forensics operators and they have

287
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,620
really good relation with the OT side of

288
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,660
the house you might go look and put

289
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,579
their hands on these devices what do

290
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,260
they see on the LCD screen like these

291
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,779
little two-row

292
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,399
outputs right you're going to see

293
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,519
information that's primarily related to

294
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,440
the physical process that the device is

295
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,360
managing maybe you get a little bit of

296
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,880
status information about IP addresses or

297
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,160
the status of interfaces or things like

298
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,480
this right and there's usually a

299
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,920
configuration menu you can push some

300
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,839
buttons to navigate through

301
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,720
but that's a really narrow window to try

302
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,760
to get

303
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,079
Dynamic control over this device

304
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,240
particularly again if the bad guy is

305
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,140
implanted and has free reign over the

306
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,300
internal behavior of that device and so

307
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,399
what you wind up with is either very

308
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,500
shallow findings right because the

309
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,120
information that's being emitted out of

310
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,720
the interface as you can see is not the

311
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,339
kind of Rich information we typically

312
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,260
think of when we're doing forensics on

313
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,180
computers right so the findings either

314
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,100
very shallow or you have no diagnosis at

315
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,079
all right these these mechanisms are

316
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,120
simply not built or designed to

317
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,000
facilitate that kind of operation

318
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,279
well what do you do then

319
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
you may if if you don't just throw it in

320
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,019
the recycle bin out back you may invoke

321
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,680
some kind of vendor RMA procedure and if

322
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
it doesn't fall off the back of a FedEx

323
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,440
truck on the way to the vendor and wind

324
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,959
up on eBay the vendor gets their hands

325
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,779
on it and what do they do with it well

326
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,360
they may not have the time the tools or

327
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,980
the people to deal with it

328
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,480
right and so they just kind of triage

329
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,459
and say oh do we refurbish it or recycle

330
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:26,040
it and the story ends there right so

331
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,720
some weird symptoms have happened some

332
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,459
serious incident intrusion but nobody

333
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,140
has achieved understanding as to what

334
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,640
has actually happened

335
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,800
even if they do have the time the tools

336
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
the people the staff the know-how the

337
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,640
will

338
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,440
what might they get out of that if they

339
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,420
do a lengthy forensics teardown of the

340
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,459
Box well maybe they get some private

341
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:48,180
iocs and maybe that informs a firmware

342
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,100
patch an upgrade cycle

343
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,720
but

344
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,300
doesn't scale so what's wrong with this

345
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,040
picture two things I'll posit two things

346
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,459
one we don't keep the problem at the

347
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,440
edge closest to the utilities who might

348
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
have the people and technology and the

349
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,920
time to kind of diagnose the problem

350
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,000
right there

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
and second for any iocs that might come

352
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,440
out of this process they're not fed

353
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,000
forward necessarily into the community

354
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,639
right so lift you know Rising tide lifts

355
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,079
all boats that kind of thing right so

356
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,420
nowhere in this workflow is this feeding

357
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,459
forward into some intelligence threat

358
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:24,600
intelligence sharing run by Doe or sizza

359
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,920
all right

360
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,320
what do we how do we want to change the

361
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,180
world here so what we're proposing

362
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,040
effectively is to add a hot path a fast

363
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,440
path to this diagnostic workflow

364
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,060
through this concept of a secure

365
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,040
forensic sport

366
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,600
and so if you had this kind of

367
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,459
capability

368
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,920
a technique that's designed to examine

369
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,899
the low-level Behavior or devices and

370
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,899
Export it rapidly then you can push that

371
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,760
detection that analysis to the edge

372
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,220
where the utility is and they can run

373
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,920
this diagnostic get good information

374
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,920
share the iocs out to other utilities so

375
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,899
that everybody benefits right hey I've

376
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:02,339
been attacked and compromised by this

377
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,760
particular

378
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,899
this particular piece of malware

379
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,480
and I want you to know about it right so

380
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,540
that is how things should work right now

381
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,219
there's no way to do that fast path

382
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,260
that's a vision of the future and I

383
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,300
think our purpose here is to suggest

384
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,940
that a working group can form around a

385
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,200
standard

386
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,700
to achieve such a capability

387
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,420
do you really want to throw away home

388
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,820
court advantage right so one advantage

389
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,860
we have maybe one of the only advantages

390
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,139
we have over attackers is physical

391
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,240
access to these devices

392
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,500
right

393
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,300
and so

394
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,880
that's a really good advantage to have

395
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,060
but we risk squandering it if we leave

396
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,040
the state of the art and the state of

397
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,519
the practice of engineering access and

398
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,199
administrative access to these devices

399
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,779
balkanized right so having many

400
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,440
heterogeneous ways vendor-specific ways

401
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,680
accessing this type of information

402
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,100
and we think that the key thing here is

403
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,160
that this access must scale by which we

404
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,420
mean

405
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,100
think about a first the Cyber first

406
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,040
responder cyber Mutual Aid right how do

407
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,779
you scale a response to a widespread

408
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,180
intrusion well the precious resource

409
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,820
here is human attention

410
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,940
it's the attention and the mental cycles

411
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,260
of the people who are charged with

412
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,480
fixing things and one way to speed up

413
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,820
their workflow one way to speed up their

414
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,660
work

415
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,699
is by giving them a very consistent set

416
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,260
of expectations about what that

417
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,880
interface looks like and how it behaves

418
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,560
and what its capabilities are so that's

419
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,420
what we mean by scale and that

420
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,519
consistency I think can be achieved if

421
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,019
everyone does this in a very

422
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,760
standardized way there's plenty of

423
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,680
degrees of freedom how to implement it

424
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,260
but the what and the capabilities I

425
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,279
think can be codified in a standard

426
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,839
and that's the idea of a secure forensic

427
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,160
support what do we mean by these three

428
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,899
words I think we could have very lengthy

429
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,240
discussion about the exact semantics of

430
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,399
every single one of these words but I'll

431
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,459
give a brief summary right by secure we

432
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,760
mean use modern cryptography to help

433
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,639
balance the IP rights of both the

434
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,160
vendors and the utilities right so

435
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,779
certainly there's legitimate interest on

436
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,100
behalf of the manufacturers not to have

437
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,300
their firmware spread across the

438
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,880
internet fair enough certainly utilities

439
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,920
may be very protective of the particular

440
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,839
settings and set points and device

441
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,180
profiles that they've developed

442
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,779
by forensics information we mean the

443
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:36,480
kind of access to computer level

444
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,860
Behavior

445
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,019
of data flow and control flow that we

446
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,420
would normally see in it forensics

447
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,600
and make sure that it's trustworthy

448
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,420
and then by Port well that's fairly

449
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,220
self-explanatory except the point is

450
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,019
that of course there's some guidelines

451
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,940
around the physical instantiation of

452
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,199
that port

453
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,420
but this goes back to that standardized

454
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,420
and consistent

455
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,439
property that I just talked about

456
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,419
so where are we coming from like are we

457
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,760
just uh do we have any sort of basis of

458
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,679
confidence that this can be done or am I

459
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,020
just spouting about the future we've

460
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,240
previously on some other projects put

461
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,099
together a ruggedized device that is

462
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,199
essentially a first aid kit a forensics

463
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,099
first aid kit uh

464
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,799
as many of you can probably appreciate

465
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,540
it's fairly difficult to just show up

466
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,340
with a random box at a substation be

467
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,740
like hey can we plug this in it is

468
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,919
difficult to to get stuff like that into

469
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,160
the environment however we can what we

470
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,620
did in our project is take some selected

471
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,380
capabilities from that device

472
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,059
miniaturize them shrink them down into a

473
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:46,860
custom design board that fits in this

474
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,340
particular R attack and that just goes

475
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,440
to show that you don't need racks of

476
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,480
server equipment to do like big heavy

477
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,919
Computing and machine learning and big

478
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,440
data to do intrusion detection you can

479
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,840
shrink the stuff down and put it inside

480
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,419
the chassis of a device and that by the

481
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,460
way is an explicit argument to vendors

482
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,320
and manufacturers that this stuff is not

483
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
only feasible it's valuable to utilities

484
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,480
and can become a trusted part of the

485
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,559
domestic supply chain

486
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,600
and of course naturally right because

487
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,820
there's such a heterogeneous collection

488
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,559
of devices for lots of different OT

489
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,260
environments the exact form factor will

490
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,440
will change and that's okay right what

491
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,940
the what the standard needs to speak to

492
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,440
is the security architecture on that

493
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,000
device and the particular capabilities

494
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,160
it has for measuring the device right

495
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,140
but you can do this like the technology

496
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,360
exists to Custom Design these boards and

497
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,059
to have a number of socks that provide

498
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,760
the security guarantees you want

499
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,860
I'll spend just a little bit of time on

500
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,900
this slide I think the place to focus is

501
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,200
the the chart at the bottom which shows

502
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,480
two sets of conversations and I

503
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,160
deliberately sort of left out a lot of

504
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,539
the crypto uh cryptography in this talk

505
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,240
um more than happy to talk to anyone

506
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,799
who's interested about our crypto spec

507
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,960
document but there's two sets of

508
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,640
disjointed conversations going on at

509
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,500
manufacturing time there's a whole

510
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,720
series of actions to set up certificate

511
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,539
authorities and put the right

512
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:19,140
certificates into this SEI device so

513
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,760
that later on utilities and First

514
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Responders can come access it and have

515
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,900
vendor sanctioned access to this

516
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,240
low-level information and then on the

517
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,400
right is the actual set of conversations

518
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,960
that might happen during some kind of

519
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,900
emergency scenario or other forensics

520
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,460
examination and the Heart of it is that

521
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,679
SEI or secure element interface which is

522
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,299
the picture a couple of pictures I just

523
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:42,860
showed in the last couple of slides

524
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,760
um the key point and purpose of the

525
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,660
cryptographic authorization framework

526
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,760
isn't to be an important part of the

527
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,440
standard is to specify how these

528
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,400
conversations can take place

529
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,440
appropriately we're not rolling our own

530
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,700
crypto we're not doing any crazy

531
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,280
outlandish cryptography stuff this is

532
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,039
fairly straight down the middle uh kind

533
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,539
of public key authentication

534
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,820
authorization that's used in a variety

535
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,340
of circumstances like Banks and Telecom

536
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,980
and at the heart of it are a set of

537
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,080
standardized entitlements that describe

538
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,780
the actions one can take on the device

539
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,700
like dumping firmware and reading memory

540
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,559
or uploading configuration and examining

541
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,500
file system stuff like that

542
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,340
the only thing that might be a little

543
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,600
bit different than traditional Access

544
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Control scenarios and authorization

545
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,440
scenarios is that in this setting I

546
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,000
think the argument can be made that read

547
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,200
operation is actually a little more

548
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,000
sensitive than write operations right

549
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,500
but that doesn't matter to our framework

550
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,840
it's just the set of entitlements that

551
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,299
you receive

552
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,000
here's a quick picture of the piece of

553
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,380
software that's on the programmer which

554
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,179
was that middle box a couple of slides

555
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,580
ago which is really just a generic

556
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,780
workstation or an engineering

557
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,419
workstation and it's essentially a dumb

558
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:52,679
client that only knows how to

559
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,400
authenticate to the SEI and this is a

560
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,900
command line UI that we wrote to

561
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,960
demonstrate this for cyber First

562
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,580
Responders is kind of what they'd see in

563
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,320
connecting to and authenticating

564
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,320
pre-authenticating to the SEI and auth

565
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,299
supported is sort of a help menu says

566
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,520
Hey for this particular device here are

567
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,440
all the actions that are authorized here

568
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,460
are all the entitlements that are

569
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,960
authorized and they're mapped to that

570
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,059
oid and the oid is the key piece of

571
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,679
information that's in the certificate

572
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,140
that gets checked and that permits that

573
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,740
low-level functionality to be actuated

574
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,539
so

575
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,580
as you may have gleaned by now like the

576
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,980
main argument the main benefit here we

577
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,980
think is going to be cutting that time

578
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,039
to decision to accelerate recovery and

579
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,000
restart

580
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,919
so that's the kind of the core use case

581
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,720
here and as always we want to stay

582
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,179
focused on the operational benefits

583
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,460
okay so operational benefits are

584
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,520
naturally you can scale your ability to

585
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,460
scan your infrastructure

586
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,480
concurrently you don't have to kind of

587
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,820
manually walk through substations or do

588
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,380
one box at a time this is something

589
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,460
where you can initiate these

590
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,919
measurements collect them back and then

591
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,500
maybe on day one you have across the

592
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,720
board yeah 98 of our devices are cyber

593
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,520
clean these three are suspect let's go

594
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,260
do a deeper dive or let's replace them

595
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,020
or take some other form of remediation

596
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,460
one other benefit might be keeping

597
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,620
remediate keeping equipment in service

598
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,120
so you don't have to like throw stuff at

599
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,440
a vendor and hope that they do something

600
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,539
with it we think of course this is

601
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,520
applicable in some other scenarios

602
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,799
rather than emergency scenarios this is

603
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,740
probably useful as a backstop for supply

604
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,720
chain auditing because it does have very

605
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
low level access to device as a backstop

606
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,400
for other mechanisms of asset

607
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,740
enumeration and then possibly because it

608
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,360
has such a low level appreciation of the

609
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,580
device Behavior help with predictive

610
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,380
maintenance

611
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,940
this is my argument in a nutshell

612
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,220
Defenders need privileged access right

613
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,039
let's let the good guys

614
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:50,760
uh

615
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,799
swing into action here

616
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,620
and unfortunately a lot of the I.T

617
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,260
forensics techniques that we know and

618
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,440
love are inapplicable in field devices

619
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,320
and so the secure forensics Port is a

620
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,260
way to try to bridge that Gap and say

621
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,600
for certain very fundamental measurement

622
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,059
Primitives that are that help enhance

623
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,039
and facilitate forensics active

624
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,039
forensics in an ongoing scenario you can

625
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,539
miniaturize them and put them inside the

626
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,679
chassis and then you have that

627
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,960
capability pre-placed right when did

628
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,580
Noah build the ark right before the

629
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,659
flood

630
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,640
and and the key sort of intellectual

631
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,919
piece here is that we can do it using

632
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,559
modern cryptographic Frameworks in a way

633
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,679
that respects vendor and utility IP

634
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,179
so what does Michael want to see happen

635
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:37,679
all right we've taken the first couple

636
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,059
steps

637
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,679
in kind of drafting the architecture

638
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:43,020
creating a couple of proof of Concepts I

639
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,360
think the next step in the story is up

640
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,640
to you right we're willing to continue

641
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,799
engaging on this topic and we had a

642
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,419
couple of good lunchtime conversations

643
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:53,520
about appropriate standards that might

644
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,740
be receptors for this idea

645
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,900
certainly I'm looking to form a

646
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,280
technical community of Interest around

647
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,120
this

648
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,919
and really see where we can take it

649
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,320
through the standards process more than

650
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,940
willing to talk to any vendors or

651
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,919
manufacturers or utilities and prototype

652
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,960
in the concept for their device

653
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,659
and I think you know the the key

654
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,400
takeaway here right goes back to all

655
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,799
those those High sounding philosophical

656
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,740
words I said about incentives right the

657
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,480
point here is to allow us to

658
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,159
collectively operate

659
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:24,960
during these emergency scenarios because

660
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,240
we've seen we've actually been you know

661
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,340
seen some very highly realistic field

662
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,260
scenarios and it is not a pretty picture

663
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,760
when you've got a large infrastructure

664
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,080
that is completely owned by the

665
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,600
adversary it's a not a comfortable

666
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,520
feeling to watch your devices do stuff

667
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,700
you're not commanding them to do

668
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,080
Dale had a very good piece of advice

669
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,880
sorry as you close like what is the call

670
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,919
to action highlight one thing so

671
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,539
naturally you know we want to talk about

672
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,220
expanding and refining that entitlement

673
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,539
set we want to review the crypto

674
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,940
architecture really fine-tune that

675
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,039
identify any similar efforts that are

676
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,900
out there select an appropriate

677
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,760
standards process to take this through

678
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,100
but I think the key thing

679
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,799
all right the key ask is

680
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,840
let's demonstrate this for devices of

681
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,700
Interest whether you're a manufacturer

682
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,740
utility because I think that will help

683
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,299
surface some of the requirements that

684
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,799
will inform the standard and make it

685
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,600
more mature

686
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,419
so happy to discuss any dependencies I

687
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,520
may have overlooked any alignments with

688
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,100
other ongoing projects any objections

689
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,900
anyone has to this because maybe we can

690
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,240
fix them and of course always glad to

691
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,760
hear any encouragement so thank you very

692
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,799
much for your attention I'm willing to

693
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,059
entertain your questions and perhaps

694
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,860
your answers so if you have them line up

695
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,059
at the microphones on either side of the

696
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:37,450
room thank you very much

697
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:44,759
[Applause]
