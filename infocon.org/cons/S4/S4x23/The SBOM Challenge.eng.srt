1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,680
everyone I hope your lunch was good and

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,599
that you'll settle right in for a coma

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,179
as we renounce the results I'd like to

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,700
introduce my co-speaker Hannah Pearson

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,440
kleinheiter who is a cyber security

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,960
researcher par Excellence at the Idaho

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,840
National Laboratory she and a couple of

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,779
other members of the inl team have been

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,060
my partners in crime in helping Dale

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,580
host the first software bill of

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,340
materials challenge first thing I'm

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,540
going to say yes

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,180
and we've called it a challenge for a

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,219
reason and we'll talk a little bit about

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,520
that in our slides

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,500
so first a little bit about the Idaho

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,899
National Laboratory the Idaho National

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,899
Laboratory is one of 17 U.S department

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,539
of energy Laboratories we focus on

21
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,640
Research that commercial industry can't

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,300
won't or shouldn't do and the inl

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,699
specializes in areas including nuclear

24
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,099
energy research Clean Energy Research

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,820
and National Security and cyber security

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,979
we are here hosting this competition

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,920
because Idaho National Laboratory has

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,439
Decades of experience in industrial

29
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,939
Control Systems vulnerability

30
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,100
assessments and hosting red blue

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,979
training and lately in enhancing the

32
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,900
adoption of software bills of materials

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,659
in the energy sector that gives us a

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,759
unique perspective for how software

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,159
bills of materials can be used and the

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,579
challenge that faces this Market

37
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,640
so just an overview of the challenge we

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,619
provided the participants with three

39
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,500
different test artifacts that they

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,740
created s-bombs from and it's s-bomb

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,360
challenge this is one of the key parts

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,040
of it and then also we asked them to

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,720
identify vulnerabilities of those

44
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,759
components of the products that they

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,439
were testing and then the third aspect

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,100
was applying information from Vex

47
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,259
documents for just automated

48
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,560
vulnerability information sharing so the

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
attendees had the opportunity to compare

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,959
tools and share s-bombs with each other

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,020
compare formats and just had the

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,000
opportunity to provide demonstrations so

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,260
I hope some of you were able to go

54
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,720
upstairs and see that and if not you

55
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,040
still have a chance just for a little

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,819
bit

57
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,800
and one thing I can say about the

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,840
participants where some of the Ponda own

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,640
and the CTF folks could focus

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,920
exclusively on the challenges that

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,440
awaited them most of the participants in

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,879
this challenge were also doing

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,980
demonstrations that all of you could see

64
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,020
so that you could explore the user

65
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,879
interface of their tools and understand

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,099
a little bit about how they characterize

67
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,379
risk so that made this a little more of

68
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,000
a challenge than would normally be the

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,019
case

70
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,080
so when we plan this challenge you saw

71
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,660
three simple objectives and we thought

72
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,780
we are going to compare apples to apples

73
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,400
we are going to come out with an answer

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,800
of what the tools are good at and what

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,420
the tools are not good at and we're

76
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,099
going to look at these specific use

77
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,379
cases and we're going to generate some

78
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,019
quality metrics

79
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,940
what we experienced instead

80
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,340
it's a little different

81
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,280
what we found about all the tools in the

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,159
s-bomb market is that each tool creator

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,340
has a specific use case and metaphor and

84
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,140
they've built functionality in their

85
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,780
tool around that metaphor so that they

86
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,180
share some common functions but at the

87
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,159
root of them they're seeking to solve

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,500
slightly different problems and so

89
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,480
understanding that as you talk to them

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,580
where their specialty is where their

91
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,220
heartbeat really gets faster is crucial

92
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,459
but for us with only three simple things

93
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,379
to solve this difference in

94
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:48,180
functionality meant that not everyone

95
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,159
who approached the challenge could be

96
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,799
expected to have equal skills at each of

97
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,720
the three things and the performance

98
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
that they had was influenced very much

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,340
by the metaphor with which they approach

100
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,879
the market

101
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,940
again what we expected capture the flag

102
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,480
now glows or pwn to own

103
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,000
and what we had instead I may be dating

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,239
myself but EDS did some wonderful videos

105
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,880
about what Consulting was like from

106
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,738
their perspective and there was one that

107
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,380
was building planes in the sky and if

108
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,660
you have not seen it please after this

109
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,300
talk Go download that video and watch it

110
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,759
you will fall off your bar stool but

111
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,500
that was more like what our challenge

112
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,960
was we came in with some rules and with

113
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,259
expectations but our performers said hey

114
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,240
wait a minute what if we did things a

115
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,220
little differently what if we added a

116
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,919
new binary to examine what if we

117
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,500
ingested s-bombs from each other to make

118
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,759
sure that we could demonstrate

119
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,580
interoperability and we hadn't thought

120
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,020
about that because we were really

121
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,060
focused on our three simple objectives

122
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,460
but the addition of those opportunities

123
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,139
to the things that you were able to see

124
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,479
in the Pavilion enriched the experience

125
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,520
I think for both the performers and the

126
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,759
challenge and the attendees a great deal

127
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,259
so for the participants thank you you

128
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,580
were brave enough to bring your

129
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,520
capabilities in and expose them to a

130
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,979
week of observation you were bold enough

131
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,900
to take on challenges from a national

132
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,060
lab and when it began I think they all

133
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,380
thought we were sitting in the room

134
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,539
gleefully rubbing our hands to see we're

135
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,680
going to get them we're going to get

136
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,919
them so you are very brave and we

137
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,240
appreciate you on the next wait wait

138
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,740
on the next couple of slides I'm going

139
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,720
to have each team stand up and if you

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,280
would be willing to work with me to

141
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,320
recognize them because we very much

142
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,419
appreciate their contribution to

143
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,460
extending the market for software bills

144
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,900
of materials

145
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,180
Oh but before we do that I'm going to go

146
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,979
back

147
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,620
in even this so everyone is heard I

148
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,720
believe that Lindsay sirkovnik shared

149
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,820
earlier in the week what an issue the

150
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,220
naming challenge is for software bills

151
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,320
of materials when you open a software

152
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,120
bill of material you're looking at a

153
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,639
component and it might be called one

154
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,560
thing in one place or another thing in

155
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,419
another or there might be components

156
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,100
that share names and all of a sudden

157
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,600
wait a minute which one is this really

158
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,660
how do I know well even in our own

159
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,840
performers we had a naming Collision so

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,639
I wanted to bring your attention that

161
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,919
adoles has a platform that they call

162
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,199
fact which is the framework for analysis

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,319
and coordinated trust and security risk

164
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,380
advisors also has a fact and that's

165
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,199
firmware analysis and comparison tool so

166
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,060
when we first got started it was very

167
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,680
important that we got our facts straight

168
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,500
so first adoles if you would stand up we

169
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,419
appreciate you bringing your tool and

170
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,039
the work that you've done with our

171
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,219
challenge

172
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,800
thank you

173
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,000

174
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,220
thank you very much for taking part

175
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,610

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,258
and security risk advisors

180
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,900
again thank you all you have made our

181
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,520
week more interesting and you have

182
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,099
provided insights not only for the Idaho

183
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,139
National Laboratory and facilitating the

184
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,180
challenge but I think I can say to every

185
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,340
attendee that came through saw demos

186
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,319
asked questions and learned a little

187
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,300
more about software bills and materials

188
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,580
so again thank you for being our leading

189
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,819
ambassadors in this market space

190
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:56,039
all right so next I'm going to give an

191
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:57,120
overview of these are the challenge

192
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,400
artifacts we had we had a little bit of

193
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,800
difficulty finding artifacts that

194
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,080
vendors were comfortable providing for

195
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,300
this purpose it's a challenge that's

196
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,419
obviously very public and that's

197
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,880
something that's uncomfortable so huge

198
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,740
shout out to the vendors that provided

199
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,720
artifacts for this they definitely took

200
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,639
a leap of faith in trusting us and all

201
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,879
of you and we're extremely supportive so

202
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,680
our first artifact we have the

203
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,199
Transformer protection unit and that was

204
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,479
provided by Hitachi energy many many

205
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,580
thanks to them it is a bare metal

206
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,958
firmware 68k and it's extremely minimal

207
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,500
so it is a use case that we at inl were

208
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,140
very interested in and I think has not

209
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,958
been as much of a focus for the market

210
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,899
as a whole the sort of here is a single

211
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,120
binary and it has libraries compiled

212
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,640
into it but they're difficult to

213
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,300
identify and it's kind of the Legacy use

214
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,140
case so if there's old code that someone

215
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,240
is trying to find out what's in this you

216
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,560
need to maybe look at a binary because

217
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,839
the source code is not available anymore

218
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,880
that's very interesting it's definitely

219
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,839
like on one extreme of the uh use case

220
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,279
so the next is osisoft process book and

221
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,220
again many thanks to OSI soft they were

222
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,459
fantastic in working with us they

223
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,680
already generate s-bombs and are very

224
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,740
enthusiastic about this space so

225
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,540
processbook is a Windows product and

226
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,959
it's used for viewing and analyzing data

227
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,320
and it's again not all tools were

228
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,120
prepared to support Windows but it's

229
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,440
just a different

230
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,500
part of that space so then our third

231
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,720
artifact was actually based on a request

232
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,760
from the group of participants it is

233
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,640
open wrt which is an open source router

234
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,339
we uh it's arm-based

235
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,860
we added in libraries and picked what

236
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,080
made sense to include in that particular

237
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,459
build but it was something that is yet

238
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,080
another completely different use case

239
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,959
and you might say a router doesn't seem

240
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,540
like ICS equipment well routers are used

241
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,160
everywhere they're used in all sorts of

242
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,980
environments including ICS so it was

243
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,260
just you know three completely different

244
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,360
things and hopefully it provides broad

245
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,519
coverage but at the same time there's a

246
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,620
ton of different artifacts in between so

247
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,600
just wanted to say we have three data

248
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,779
points and that is by no means a

249
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,320
comprehensive coverage of anything so

250
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,440
yeah so we chose three specific use

251
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,500
cases in our artifacts that aligned with

252
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,720
the goals of the challenge not all of

253
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,120
these artifacts match what some of these

254
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,519
participants see every day so for them

255
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,620
this was part of the challenge wait a

256
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,600
minute this isn't the usual binary I get

257
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,240
what do I do with this or this isn't my

258
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,160
normal mode of doing business how do I

259
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,560
work with that and I was very pleased

260
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,560
with how the participants adapted to the

261
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,060
environment we threw them bare metal

262
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,240
firmware is a big challenge yeah

263
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,160
and as we get to results we'll go over

264
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
that a bit more

265
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,320
so our timeline for this event was very

266
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,180
compressed because we wanted to be able

267
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,279
to give you reasonable results on

268
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,279
Thursday so that meant that when most

269
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,320
everyone was barely getting on a plane

270
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
our participants were here in The s-bomb

271
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,220
Pavilion at nine o'clock in the morning

272
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,800
receiving their first binaries for

273
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,860
s-bomb extraction at the very beginning

274
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,800
the in very bin end of that day inl

275
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,660
provided their own software bills of

276
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,060
materials generated by us many by hand

277
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,339
which is not necessarily the best way to

278
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,800
do it but that's what we had for the

279
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,480
participants who did not do binary

280
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,760
extraction they could take the s-bombs

281
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,560
we provided and proceed on The Challenge

282
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,420
from that point on so they joined the

283
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,660
game a little way through by the end of

284
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,940
that day the participants provided us

285
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,640
vulnerability enrichment information

286
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,140
either using the software bills of

287
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,120
materials that they had created via

288
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,579
vulnerability extraction or using the

289
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:02,399
ones that we provided to them they used

290
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,740
the different vulnerability sources that

291
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,920
they have nvd likely being one but for

292
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,620
many international data sources all

293
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,060
kinds of places that they learn about

294
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,459
vulnerabilities and they enriched every

295
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,980
sub-component present in that software

296
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,079
bill of material with information about

297
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,000
the vulnerabilities that they felt that

298
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,399
it contained

299
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,519
on Tuesday we provided a vulnerability

300
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:29,339
exploitability exchange set of documents

301
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,860
to these vendors these would be a place

302
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,019
where if a vendor realized they had a

303
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,000
vulnerability in a product they might

304
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,339
start by investigating it and so they

305
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,620
may send out a Vex document as an alert

306
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,600
that hey we've noticed there's this

307
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,700
published vulnerability we're doing an

308
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,320
inspection to see if it affects our

309
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,959
product once that inspection bears fruit

310
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,240
they may then provide additional Vex

311
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,519
updates that say it is either not

312
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,980
affected or it is affected and here is

313
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,279
how and then once they patch it and fix

314
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,740
that they may then provide further Vex

315
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,500
documents that describe the patching so

316
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,000
it was important to us to understand

317
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,980
that the performers in this challenge

318
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,220
could ingest that Vex information and

319
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,399
include it in their own risk display so

320
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,779
that if they said there was this

321
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,459
vulnerability that a database was

322
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,920
reporting if a Vex document said that

323
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,839
that vulnerability didn't exist or had

324
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,240
been passed that they could update their

325
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,980
interface to align with that new

326
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,740
information now because it was a

327
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,420
challenge because this information was

328
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,000
going to see by everybody here we made

329
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,940
up vexes that did not apply to real

330
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,480
vulnerabilities suffered by real vendors

331
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,899
so with this I want to note that we did

332
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,880
not have the time and resources

333
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,700
necessary to identify whether these

334
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,220
packages identified or you know accurate

335
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,839
complete all of that so we're not making

336
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,180
any assertions about that this is just

337
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,399
an observation of what the s-bombs

338
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,220
produced contained so the first number

339
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,040
is how many packages were identified so

340
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,500
that's component and different types of

341
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,120
components and then the second is how

342
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,639
many files were identified just based on

343
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,740
the data in s-bombs so

344
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,000
we noticed a broad you know variety of

345
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
different results depending on the tools

346
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,899
and again

347
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,000
these are very different tools with

348
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,680
different use cases different strengths

349
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,800
so we're not saying this is a complete

350
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,339
picture it's just here's a snapshot of

351
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:31,200
what we provided and what the

352
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,940
participants were able to provide in

353
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,760
response to that so depending on how

354
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,540
well the tools fit the particular

355
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,180
artifact the TPU 2000 that's the

356
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,920
Transformer protection unit

357
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,860
that was not a use case that any of the

358
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,480
tools were prepared to handle and I

359
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,760
think that's just it's not something to

360
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,220
say that tools are bad it's just not

361
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,519
something they cover so no one had any

362
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,360
components identified and that is not

363
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,519
entirely surprising it was just here is

364
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,500
a bit of an outlier in terms of what

365
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,899
everyone covers so then

366
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,180
um with processbook one thing that I

367
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,699
want to mention specifically is netrise

368
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,980
did not have any Windows coverage coming

369
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,240
into this but they managed to

370
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,040
change things into a format that would

371
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,980
work and provide results regardless so

372
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,079
there was a lot of flexibility a lot of

373
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,360
quick turnaround and response and

374
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,980
working with what they had so I think

375
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,420
that's something that we're seeing is

376
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,000
that you know with a good team you can

377
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,980
get results for things even if you're

378
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,199
not necessarily

379
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,560
ready to support that and you can get

380
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,019
ready really fast so great job to

381
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,060
everyone for your flexibility and then

382
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,760
yeah open wrt just had a lot more

383
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,240
components overall so processbook yeah

384
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,459
had quite a few components open wrt we

385
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,980
included a lot so kind of seeing the

386
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,779
variation across products too some

387
00:15:57,779 --> 00:15:59,820
products may have far more components to

388
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,579
identify than others and some companies

389
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,579
may be more ambitious about matching

390
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:07,440
those components or may have different

391
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,019
strengths and also there's kind of a

392
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,000
trade-off of accuracy and completeness

393
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,980
you can say I think it's this and

394
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,139
there's not necessarily a mechanism

395
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,199
currently in s-bond schemas to identify

396
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,540
like we're pretty sure this is a

397
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,300
component but not 100 so there's kind of

398
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,360
seems like this not certain and having a

399
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,100
way to quantify that uncertainty is

400
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,600
something that a lot of the tools

401
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,000
provide in the user interface that

402
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,980
doesn't necessarily get reflected in the

403
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,560
output of just the s-bomb so

404
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,820
it's something that we might see

405
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,920
evolving with time too and a couple of

406
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,259
notes before we change slides on the

407
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,639
side Beach line you're going to notice

408
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,639
an N A that is because the side beats

409
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,320
tool focuses on a different use case

410
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,660
they do not do component extraction from

411
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,279
binary but they're going to provide

412
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,680
results on later steps so that's why

413
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,079
their row looks a little bit different

414
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,519
and if you're looking at this slide I

415
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,139
saw some folks taking pictures of it

416
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,779
just a note on the quantification more

417
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,660
is not necessarily better fewer is not

418
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,419
necessarily worse for each number in

419
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,699
this slide I would encourage those folks

420
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,919
that stood up a minute ago go to them

421
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,900
and ask them to explain the meaning

422
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,179
behind it because there is a lot of

423
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,740
depth in the decisions that they make

424
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,020
about how they identify components and

425
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,939
what they use to do it there's a lot of

426
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,400
variability and a lot of assumptions is

427
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,040
giving you a Known Unknown where I'm not

428
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,020
quite certain and I'm going to provide

429
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,700
that information to you is that better

430
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,160
than not telling you depending on your

431
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,080
use case I could make a case for both

432
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,140
sides so please look at these numbers as

433
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,240
indicators of potential but to

434
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,220
understand what they really mean getting

435
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,340
into the tool designers on mind and

436
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,140
understanding how their heuristics work

437
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,900
is crucial so the next part of the

438
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,000
challenge step two was identifying

439
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,679
vulnerabilities that affect specific

440
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,919
components and a caveat with this is

441
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,240
that just because of vulnerability

442
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,919
affects a component doesn't mean it

443
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,960
necessarily affects the product and with

444
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,179
s-bomb what you're getting is here are

445
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,400
some suggestions here are some maybes

446
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,260
you probably want to look into this more

447
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,840
but just because a vulnerability is in a

448
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,340
component doesn't mean it affects the

449
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,020
product more testing is needed to

450
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,760
determine whether it does or does not so

451
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,320
that's just something I want to make

452
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,080
clear first with these identified cves

453
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,039
again there's a very large number and

454
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,679
huge variability and you have to look at

455
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,360
the actual data to see what those

456
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,980
numbers mean so for instance with

457
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,299
processbook

458
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,860
finite State identified 85

459
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,539
vulnerabilities those were pretty much

460
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:38,820
just one library and finding all those

461
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,580
vulnerabilities is you know you'd be

462
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,500
like oh there's 85 vulnerabilities but

463
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,260
maybe if you fix that one library or

464
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,179
swap it out for something else

465
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,520
then you can fix all of them so these

466
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,179
numbers are interesting but again as

467
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,160
with everything how they're presented is

468
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
really important and that's something

469
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,640
that we were very interested in it's

470
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,100
difficult to capture because there's not

471
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,160
nice numbers and you know saying here's

472
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,919
a user interface take a look is not

473
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,840
something we have time for to really go

474
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,140
through so definitely recommend looking

475
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,640
into these products more if you're

476
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,620
interested in asking about just how the

477
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,960
vulnerabilities are presented and how

478
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,460
they're identified so

479
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,559
yeah we looked at vulnerability sources

480
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,440
we asked each group how many sources

481
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,240
they have and that's something that

482
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,400
definitely also correlates with the

483
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,960
number of identified vulnerabilities

484
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,880
something we observed that was really

485
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,620
interesting is finite State also

486
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,840
identified non-cve vulnerabilities so

487
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,600
that's something that you know different

488
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
tools provide different levels of

489
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,860
functionality with vulnerability

490
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,600
information and this kind of goes back

491
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,700
to our whole we have five different

492
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,400
things that cut but what is the use case

493
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,820
and what is this underlying purpose of

494
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,440
this tool so if you're looking for all

495
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,580
the vulnerability and risk management

496
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,500
information you might be looking at a

497
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,179
different tool than if you're looking

498
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,460
for you know generating s-bombs or like

499
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,039
sharing stuff there's just a lot of

500
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,260
purposes so that's something that we

501
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,860
found interesting and useful and we

502
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,900
looked at this information through flat

503
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,760
files so they gave us a list of

504
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,860
vulnerabilities identified it could be

505
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,660
that for the product for the product

506
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,700
that identified 85 vulnerabilities their

507
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,440
user interface says and all of these

508
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,660
don't matter because we didn't see that

509
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,580
user interface that's a level of meaning

510
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,559
we can't provide forward to you in these

511
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,260
numbers so again if you look at this

512
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,640
slide and you want to take this as

513
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,620
quantification please talk to The

514
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,840
Experts for these tools for what these

515
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,820
numbers really mean and how these might

516
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,039
appear leveraged within their product

517
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,960
because the user interface will provide

518
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,580
a lot of meaning that we were not able

519
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,820
to see so the third aspect of the

520
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,559
challenge was importing the

521
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,380
vulnerability exchange documents so

522
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,360
different tools again different use

523
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,179
cases different purposes and just going

524
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,299
through these adoles they do support Vex

525
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,400
ingest but they are very intentional and

526
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,380
careful about who is allowed to generate

527
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,080
Vex documents and within their tools use

528
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,140
case the only group that has the

529
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,299
authority to do that is the OEM or the

530
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,160
vendor so the vendor is the one that can

531
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,020
produce Vex documents and for our

532
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,880
purposes they were not comfortable

533
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,220
importing Vex documents that we

534
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,299
generated

535
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,480
for this challenge so that's just a note

536
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,299
of they did not participate in this

537
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:30,360
aspect they do support Vex ingest but it

538
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,580
was not exercised in this Challenge and

539
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,620
then for side beats Psy beats tool

540
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,600
produces Vex documents and can

541
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,340
select information and import it and

542
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,140
generate a structured Vex document to

543
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,600
exchange based on the data that is

544
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,159
provided in s-bombs and from just a user

545
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,100
with the tool and then for finite State

546
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
they ingested inel's Vex documents

547
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,960
I don't have too much more to say our

548
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,080
Vex documents were fictitious for the

549
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,120
purposes of this challenge we did not

550
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,400
again as Ginger mentioned we did not

551
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,200
want to provide actual vulnerabilities

552
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,620
for these products because it was not

553
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,360
necessarily the purpose of the challenge

554
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,320
we just wanted to test how is this

555
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,600
format supported so netrise does not

556
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,659
currently support Vex and they commented

557
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,280
that they have not received requests for

558
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,919
it so we're seeing that maybe the market

559
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,059
is not valuing this as much yet maybe it

560
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,860
is kind of like s-bombs were a couple

561
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,940
years ago

562
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,179
we're talking about it but overall the

563
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,340
market is really not so that's something

564
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,860
that is an observation I think in the

565
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,539
future we will probably see more of it

566
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,820
but that remains to be seen and then for

567
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,919
the security risk advisors they also

568
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,720
ingested rfx documents and I don't have

569
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,860
too much more to say about that so

570
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,380
so we have some Impressions from what we

571
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,620
saw

572
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,780
if we wanted to find the one tool that

573
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,840
was going to be the best we did not

574
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,659
we also did not find in this group of

575
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,640
tools the Silver Bullet that is going to

576
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,740
solve all of the software transparency

577
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,320
issues that we struggle with each tool

578
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
has a metaphor and a purpose and they

579
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,580
contribute to that larger objective but

580
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,740
no one tool is ready to just take it all

581
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,080
on and be the ultimate answer to

582
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,820
everything yet and I think that's good

583
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,100
because in the theme of this conference

584
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,020
that leaves plenty of room to explore

585
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,480
both for the current tools that are in

586
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,700
panel to solve problems but also for

587
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,320
additional folks that have research

588
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,419
ideas or challenges that they need

589
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,100
research or that they want to research

590
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,039
and try to solve themselves

591
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,039
so what we did find is again the theme

592
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,780
of all of this is the tools have

593
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,480
different uh fundamental like

594
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,240
um design and use cases so they've

595
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,700
chosen specific purposes that they've

596
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,039
really thought about and designed around

597
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,039
not to say that all of the tools don't

598
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,260
support a very broad range of use cases

599
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,820
but we thought there were some that

600
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,980
really stood out so when we talked to

601
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,140
adoles Again original equipment

602
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,900
manufacturers and vendors they have good

603
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,780
support for data at scale and having

604
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,940
full product lines that have component

605
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,440
information being able to map things

606
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,100
across those and then produce valuable

607
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,679
information based on that so Psy beats

608
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,820
is their idea is more around generating

609
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,320
the s-bombs and maintaining and

610
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,400
distributing them so they have

611
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,080
mechanisms for sharing they have a

612
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,620
platform to just distribute that

613
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,140
information they also have a lot of

614
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,440
focus on the structure of the s-bomb so

615
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,320
making sure that they comply with the

616
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,980
schemas and that they fit with that data

617
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,559
format so they're very good for helping

618
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,140
to generate that and

619
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,020
than finite state had a lot of

620
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,059
vulnerability information so they had

621
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:02,640
far more vulnerability sources which if

622
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,720
you're looking for risk management

623
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,960
information that's extremely valuable

624
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,000
um not that again everyone has a lot of

625
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,740
these different features but providing

626
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,059
that detailed vulnerability information

627
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,320
can be good for making decisions about

628
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,840
what is a problem with software products

629
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,539
or what is relevant what might affect

630
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:25,559
your environment so especially for an

631
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,419
end user who is trying to make those

632
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,279
decisions and get valuable information

633
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,039
for that finite State definitely stood

634
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:36,299
out netrise again is very focused on a

635
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:39,000
lot of that risk evaluation and

636
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,520
providing that information to assess and

637
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,700
make decisions so they have some

638
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,380
additional implementation specific

639
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,539
functionalities so being able to test

640
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:51,720
against here's a specific system looking

641
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,659
at okay there's these users and default

642
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,179
password words and actually found in one

643
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,520
of the artifacts a hard-coded password

644
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,080
that we were able to verify with the

645
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,760
vendor Who provided that artifact to us

646
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,700
so that was pretty cool and I think

647
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,500
that's just again totally different use

648
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,779
cases lots of awesome strengths that we

649
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,179
saw and then for security risk advisors

650
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,539
their main contribution is providing

651
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,960
that Consulting to leverage existing

652
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,500
tools so they took an open source tool

653
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,720
that fact platform not to be confused

654
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,419
with the other fact platform and we're

655
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,600
able to leverage that with their skills

656
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,779
and abilities so that's a huge range of

657
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,659
use cases and a lot of great things and

658
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:39,000
the caveat I will put on this is there

659
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,039
is tons of nuance in this market so

660
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,740
these are our Impressions and the

661
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,480
participants may tell you we got it

662
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,520
wrong but I'd love to start that

663
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,620
conversation so please go to the

664
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,419
participants and ask hey what is your

665
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,640
fundamental metaphor and how did inl not

666
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,679
get this right because that will help us

667
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
learn a little bit more

668
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,020
so with our conclusions there are

669
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,059
definitely some groupings and again

670
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,279
we're not saying we have all the answers

671
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,779
because we don't but just some

672
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:09,299
observations adoles finite State and

673
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,600
netrise all stood out to us together as

674
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,400
they have capabilities that are aligned

675
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,799
with this Challenge in a way that you

676
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,779
know they generate s-bombs and they have

677
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:19,740
those

678
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,419
platforms that have been under

679
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:23,880
development and reached a level of

680
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,799
maturity that they're capable of dealing

681
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:28,559
with at least the large part of what we

682
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,380
threw at them obviously we gave a huge

683
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,940
range of things and like that bare metal

684
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,279
firmware that didn't fit into anyone's

685
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,140
use case but we didn't necessarily

686
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,179
expect it to so just

687
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,100
those all are

688
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,320
aligned with what we were testing in

689
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,840
this Challenge and then for SRA the tool

690
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,539
aided Consulting is something that we

691
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,640
definitely did not Design This challenge

692
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,659
around that use case and their platform

693
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,059
lacked the maturity to deal with the

694
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:59,820
specific s-bomb generation and component

695
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,400
identification at the same level of

696
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,100
detail and um

697
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,080
completeness is a word that implies

698
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,840
there is a right answer but not the same

699
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,720
level of depth as the other tools and

700
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,279
then side beats is completely a

701
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:16,260
different use case than our challenge

702
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,340
Focus so we were actually

703
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,299
very happy to adapt our Challenge and

704
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:25,919
figure out how we could fit them in

705
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,779
because there's a lot of different

706
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,820
opportunities within this Marketplace

707
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,580
and with s-bombs and we just needed to

708
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,200
figure out how to fit them into this

709
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,020
challenge so their use case of

710
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,419
evaluating s-bomb files and providing

711
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,520
information about the semantic

712
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,980
correctness and

713
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,500
also the ability to ingest s-bombs from

714
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,960
other platforms and prove that you know

715
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,179
the s-bombs really are you know all

716
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,279
everyone's s-bombs they took everybody's

717
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,380
else's s-bombs ingested them into their

718
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,900
platform and provided feedback so that

719
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,299
was really cool to adapt in and it

720
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,220
provided a lot of richness and depth

721
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,440
that we did not otherwise plan on

722
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,299
including because it was a different

723
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,279
different use case so

724
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,360
again this challenge is just a small

725
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,940
data point and we'll talk a tiny bit

726
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,520
more about future steps but we hope that

727
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,000
this is a snapshot and just first steps

728
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,700
and we don't want this to be the last

729
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,000
word and yeah it's

730
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,340
so with these conclusions we believe

731
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,799
that all of these competitors or all of

732
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,080
these performers did a great job in

733
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,240
Rising to the challenge that we had and

734
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
producing data results

735
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,580
we had some advice for those of you who

736
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,980
came to S4 and particularly who came to

737
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,679
the s-bomb Pavilion looking to make an

738
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:49,320
acquisition in some part of the s-bomb

739
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,779
tool Market the first most important

740
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:53,460
thing is don't get thrown off the bridge

741
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,559
of death understand what is your quest

742
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:01,500
why do you want s-bombs what are you

743
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,260
trying to accomplish if you do not know

744
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,899
the answer to that question then any

745
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,760
tool will do and they were they're all

746
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,520
great but each of these tools will

747
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,260
probably help you discover through

748
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,500
conversation what your real use case is

749
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,559
why are s-bombs interesting to you I

750
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,059
encourage you to seek Hands-On

751
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,940
demonstrations have have them help you

752
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,159
use their tool to do the great things

753
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,100
that they can make it do by themselves

754
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,020
understand what the nuances are where

755
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,419
each tool inflects into meaning making

756
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,460
because that's going to be crucial in

757
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,740
your acquisition decision as this

758
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,020
conference says experiment do things

759
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,500
that are a little weird see what happens

760
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,480
but also validate the Tool's performance

761
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,059
to your specific use cases something

762
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,039
that gives you very beautiful user

763
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,740
interface graphing of risk that doesn't

764
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,480
actually meaningful in your Market

765
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,520
segment isn't going to be the right tool

766
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,500
for you no matter how well thought out

767
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,779
that is so make sure that the tool

768
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,760
you're looking at is meeting your

769
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,580
ultimate goals and maybe the numbers

770
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,919
here will help with that and maybe it is

771
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,460
really that nuanced conversation

772
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,299
foreign

773
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,120
our broader conclusions several actually

774
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,679
well it seems like several years ago

775
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,260
last year we brought a software bill of

776
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,500
material Workshop to S4 and one of the

777
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,120
afternoons of the conference we spent

778
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,100
several hours putting people in an

779
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,799
experiential exercise and asked giving

780
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,200
them a fictitious vulnerability and

781
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,059
would they want an s-bomb from the

782
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,620
vendor and would they want a Vex

783
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,179
document and what would happen if the

784
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:38,700
Vex was ultimately wrong and if you were

785
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,380
an asset owner how did you go through

786
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,080
these things if you were a vendor and we

787
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,059
got a lot of interesting responses but

788
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,279
the overall measurement that we got was

789
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,679
The Market at that moment wasn't really

790
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,840
sure what to do with these things and

791
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,520
they were still coming to conclusions

792
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,980
about how to use s-bombs everybody

793
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,279
agrees software transparency is needed

794
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,679
no one likes buying software and not

795
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,840
knowing what's in it that's Universal

796
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,059
everybody can agree on that everyone

797
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,580
agrees that having a standardized format

798
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,580
to exchange information about what is in

799
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,799
your software and make meaning from that

800
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,260
about what risks that in that means for

801
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,960
you and your industry is crucial and

802
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,240
s-bombs definitely are a viable

803
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,279
mechanism for serving those interests

804
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,399
how we make meaning on top of that

805
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,580
opportunity is really up to us and this

806
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,159
Market has just started with that even

807
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,919
in Vendor conversations so by the way

808
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,500
vendors are adopting s-bomb platforms

809
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,659
they are adopting them both for their

810
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,880
own internal development efforts because

811
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,220
every development shop is better if they

812
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,419
know what's in the things they're

813
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:47,880
producing and it's one thing to say I

814
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,620
know what I put in it but it's quite

815
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,120
another thing to say I know what came

816
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,860
out the other end because sometimes

817
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,840
everybody who's coded here you've had

818
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,640
the experience where you told the

819
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,260
compiler to do something and what it

820
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,659
actually did was not what you wanted and

821
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,640
that often happens in even professional

822
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,860
tooling even industrial Control Systems

823
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,500
so using s-bombs for inner communication

824
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
for vendor product support is happening

825
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,140
today and it's the vendors are trying to

826
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,419
experiment with how do they scale that

827
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:17,700
up how does a large equipment vendor

828
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,519
support making and updating software

829
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,860
bills of materials across thousands of

830
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,779
devices many different classes of

831
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,760
devices how do they provide those

832
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,860
software bills of materials at the right

833
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,559
time to entities who need them how do

834
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,240
they protect them from entering the

835
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,640
marketplace in inappropriate ways these

836
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,799
are large problems and the vendors are

837
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,860
actively engaged and that means s-bombs

838
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,779
are absolutely a thing that we are going

839
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:45,059
to use now and in the future and tools

840
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:46,860
like the ones you saw this week that

841
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,679
make meaning out of this transport

842
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,399
mechanism are crucial

843
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,440
we also saw that this Market is evolving

844
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,539
rapidly we talked to you about the

845
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,279
Windows support that one of the vendors

846
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,740
added in the three days of the challenge

847
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,019
that's an example of how quick this

848
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,240
Market can move when a use case emerges

849
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,879
like whatever the next log for Jay will

850
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,520
be goodness forbid this Market will

851
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,418
adapt to meet that risk head on and that

852
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:17,219
will then form what the future of

853
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,899
software bills of materials and the

854
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:22,560
tools that employ them are going to be

855
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,280
so we also have some next steps

856
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,800
we got a chance to meet with the vendors

857
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,139
ahead of time but really we had three

858
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,020
days to give them binaries to take their

859
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,899
feedback to have in-depth discussions

860
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:39,599
with them with specific challenges and

861
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,940
really explore the issue we learned a

862
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,760
lot in three days all of us together but

863
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,918
one of the things that we learned is wow

864
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,560
we'd really like to do this at a slower

865
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,320
Pace with opportunities to explore a

866
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,599
broader set of use cases and ones that

867
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,699
might be more formed around the specific

868
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,700
skills that each of the tools has and so

869
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,040
that's one of our suggestions we would

870
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,440
love to have a vendor join in a much

871
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,440
longer evaluation and offer up a wider

872
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,020
set of their product catalog and perhaps

873
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,020
outside of a conference container it

874
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,520
might be appropriate to have whatever

875
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,980
legal protection that requires but if

876
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,660
each vendor could say hey out of this

877
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,400
product catalog these are the things

878
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,859
that my tool would excel at and this is

879
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,560
what I can commit to provide in that

880
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,260
instance the that would be a far better

881
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,900
challenge environment I mean we did well

882
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,640
for three days but we could do way

883
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,820
better with that and we want to add a

884
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,680
focus on the effectiveness of the user

885
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,619
interface what Nuance is provided to an

886
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:43,079
actual user of the tool Beyond someone

887
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,300
who just takes the raw files out of it

888
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,300
and takes it from there eventually this

889
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,220
will be a machine to machine universe

890
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,200
and so we will at some point have to

891
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,480
learn to separate file production from

892
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,119
meeting making and a user interface but

893
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,460
today it is fine to contain those as we

894
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,140
learn a little bit more about how to

895
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,599
evolve both of them we also would really

896
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,880
like a longer evaluation period we're

897
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,180
thinking weeks to months so we could

898
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,820
fashion it after some of the past plug

899
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,980
fests that the software bill of

900
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,420
community has had hosted by sisa one of

901
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,040
the other things that emerged out of

902
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,500
this week is there is a significant

903
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,680
interest in the energy sector in an

904
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,540
exchange program and this was an idea

905
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,220
that was proposed a couple of years ago

906
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,800
the idea behind an exchange is that we

907
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,960
would find a vendor who was willing to

908
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,960
provide s-bombs and an asset owner and

909
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,000
whatever support they needed who could

910
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,099
consume those software bill of materials

911
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:44,579
those two would produce that in a cone

912
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,160
of liability protection legal Comfort

913
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,960
whatever it took to make that happen

914
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,540
they would work with each other to learn

915
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,820
things and evaluate things and then

916
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,740
whatever could be generalized out of

917
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,660
that in terms of Lessons Learned would

918
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,940
be shared with the broader community and

919
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,800
out after doing a number of these

920
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,079
exchange experiments we thought we could

921
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,880
really Drive maturity in the market

922
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,920
based on the experiences of these

923
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,839
particular participants when we

924
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,520
suggested that a couple of years ago

925
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,339
five vendors stood up ready to provide

926
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,680
software bills of materials but on the

927
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,599
asset owner's side the consumption

928
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:21,060
maturity was fairly low and we believe

929
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,099
that that market has changed and that's

930
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,780
another thing that we will look to bring

931
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,020
about in the department of energy hosted

932
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,480
proof of concept for software bills of

933
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,579
materials to bring back that exchange

934
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,400
idea and to bring together vendors and

935
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
asset owners to consume software bill of

936
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
materials and make meaning out of them

937
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,660
and help us all learn what it takes to

938
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,640
make that process better

939
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,980
anything else we want to say here nope I

940
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,440
think that covers it okay we have about

941
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,780
six and a half minutes for questions and

942
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,339
if you would like to ask a question

943
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,320
there are microphones on the left and

944
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,480
right side of the room if you want to

945
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,359
use them to do solo karaoke that is also

946
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,619
an option

947
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,060
I'm going to break rule number one no

948
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,980
Friendly Fire Hi boss

949
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,579
to be specific

950
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,859
Ally good job both of you I really

951
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:12,780
appreciate it appreciate it um so you

952
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,040
know we already have some legal

953
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,660
Frameworks for other programs that we're

954
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,420
doing for doe we will we be able to

955
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,820
possibly build on those for an s-bomb

956
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,660
type of challenge for doe or will we

957
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,640
have to start again and so we should say

958
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,900
that we'll be able to do this in five

959
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,800
years

960
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
so we have talked about

961
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,520
the governance came up in push Kumar's

962
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,880
conversation today what we looked at the

963
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,980
last time we had an exchange is having

964
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,280
the provider and the consumer join in a

965
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,560
non-disclosure agreement together the

966
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,119
government might be involved in an

967
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:50,520
outside non-disclosure agreement with

968
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,920
the both of them and then it would move

969
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,260
on from there hopefully we can build on

970
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,020
a framework like the Citrix program uses

971
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,660
but I would need a lawyer I would need

972
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,520
way more law school than my Law and

973
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,140
Order background allows me to have

974
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,500
thank you excellent work when you find a

975
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,020
vulnerability it's because you find a

976
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,640
link to a library and you know the

977
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,800
library has a vulnerability or is it

978
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,500
patch a word not a patch but a pattern

979
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,420
recognition thing where you see there's

980
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,880
an issue and I saw that the finite State

981
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,339
guys had I think a lot that didn't show

982
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,320
up so does that mean those were pattern

983
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,140
recognition type vulnerabilities so with

984
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:34,520
vulnerability is there are a lot of

985
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,140
components that have known vonadores

986
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,960
that someone has identified and tested

987
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,880
and proved that that vulnerability

988
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,820
affects that Library specifically you

989
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,500
know usually aversion or range of

990
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,380
versions and then you can say this

991
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,740
product uses that component and then

992
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,300
from there to link the actual

993
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,099
vulnerability back into the product

994
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:58,560
takes additional testing because maybe

995
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,540
the specific vulnerable function was not

996
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,480
used or maybe okay it's used but the

997
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,160
actual vulnerability is not exploitable

998
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,800
because of how it was used so there's a

999
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,359
lot of additional complexity that goes

1000
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,339
into proving that and all you can do

1001
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:13,079
from knowing a component that is

1002
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,420
vulnerable is in a product is say this

1003
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,820
is a vulnerability that may apply and

1004
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,680
you need to investigate further so yeah

1005
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,180
does that answer your question

1006
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,980
absolutely yeah one one more question

1007
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,200
would be can I take this away from this

1008
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,300
presentation that I've always believed

1009
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,520
that open source software was probably

1010
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,800
more bulletproof because there's more

1011
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,200
eyes on it more people working on it but

1012
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,359
open wrt had more had more

1013
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:38,240
vulnerabilities

1014
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,780
and

1015
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,220
Soros doesn't necessarily mean more

1016
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,640
yeah

1017
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,320
well and I love that the minute our

1018
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,359
questioner got off camera he made the

1019
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,339
universal symbol for pulling the pin out

1020
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:57,020
of the grenade and tossing it forward

1021
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,480
I thank you for summarizing and putting

1022
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,760
this together a way that was consumable

1023
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,599
um

1024
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,420
did you identify opportunities for

1025
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,060
standardization or normalization of

1026
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,180
either reporting or to mix your

1027
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,300
metaphors uh at least you know say

1028
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,599
what's the best tool to core an apple

1029
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,800
so as far as format there's two main

1030
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,960
component oriented s-bomb formats

1031
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,200
there's Cyclone DX and there's spdx so

1032
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,540
both of those were used in this

1033
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,940
Challenge and different participants

1034
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,900
have preferences for one or the other

1035
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,420
and I think that's an open question of

1036
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,119
what will the market move towards and

1037
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,400
how will they evolve because those are

1038
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,240
both

1039
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,220
evolving standards

1040
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,660
I should have clarified my question you

1041
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,220
had up there are different metrics of

1042
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,839
looking at you know packages and files

1043
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,400
and when you went through it at the end

1044
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,140
did you go you know what this would

1045
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,960
actually be a helpful normalized way to

1046
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,839
talk about not capability not even in

1047
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,300
evaluation but just a shared way to do

1048
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,280
this that's what I meant sorry thanks I

1049
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,619
think in our three days we identified

1050
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:09,960
some opportunity to work towards

1051
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,420
standardization but most of the things

1052
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,820
that we had to boil down to consumable

1053
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,280
metrics for this audience there is so

1054
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,800
much Nuance behind those numbers I'm not

1055
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,359
going to throw a number up and then say

1056
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,460
I don't stand behind it but there is a

1057
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,740
lot of nuance to understand so I would

1058
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,260
want standardization to incorporate that

1059
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,540
Nuance what I can tell you is our

1060
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,820
friends at cisa have some very active

1061
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,359
working groups that talk about this to a

1062
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:39,660
great deal of detail they meet I believe

1063
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,700
monthly and if you email s-bomb

1064
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,020
cisa.gov you can get involved in that

1065
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,160
conversation and they would very much

1066
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,040
much love to have you

1067
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,800
Jessica oh thank

1068
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,300
you.dhs.gov to repeat it for the

1069
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,859
recording

1070
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,500
and one thing I want to also note is

1071
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,900
that we have a bit of a naming problem

1072
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,800
identifying components and just things

1073
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,720
may be identified slightly differently

1074
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,020
by different products or even by the

1075
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,640
vendor at different times and the

1076
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,020
vendors may be identified differently

1077
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,380
partly just because names are a little

1078
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,420
bit fluid and you might have different

1079
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,339
forms of a name but also because of

1080
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,460
Acquisitions and change over time

1081
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,020
rebranding all those things make it

1082
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,020
harder to keep those names straight so

1083
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,400
oh what's in the name

1084
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,940
uh

1085
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,859
at S4

1086
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:37,500
sorry to jump the queue if I did sorry

1087
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,000
we had ignored that side of the room

1088
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,940
Brian please go ahead

1089
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,240
S4 has a long history of having fun with

1090
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,780
CVSs and I just wanted to maybe throw it

1091
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,680
out do you see room in in your next

1092
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,599
steps to have a component CVSs kind of

1093
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,760
system because it it does

1094
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,520
does s-bomb come somehow make that more

1095
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,140
important that we have a different

1096
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,940
scoring system for components versus

1097
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,119
so we're not

1098
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,220
separate information

1099
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,660
and that vulnerability scoring

1100
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,000
information can be included depending

1101
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,520
like so s-bombs do not contain

1102
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,020
vulnerability information let's make

1103
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,180
that clear but

1104
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,839
all right

1105
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,819
okay that's done I think also I see uh

1106
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:35,099
10 seconds left so

1107
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,960
um might be time to wrap this up but

1108
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,520
we're happy to talk further if anybody

1109
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,000
would like to after this

1110
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,520
okay okay cool

1111
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,339
go ahead is this one working yes okay so

1112
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:49,140
I kind of got two questions uh the first

1113
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,240
one is when you did the Hitachi did you

1114
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,160
give the software or did you give them

1115
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,599
the hardware and they had to pull off

1116
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:57,900
the the software just the software so

1117
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,940
definitely did not give anyone hardware

1118
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,400
and make them pull the firmware off of

1119
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,839
that Hardware

1120
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,359
okay and then the second question is um

1121
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,940
in the case of I had hardware and I had

1122
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,980
a hardware route of trust and I had the

1123
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,680
UEFI the OS in the app would you

1124
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,780
identify the software building material

1125
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,660
that was used in the UEFI or in the OS

1126
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,060
and in the app like the entire thing or

1127
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,180
are you just looking at the app

1128
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,920
kind of goes back to that question of

1129
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,020
what's your quest right like what do you

1130
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,000
need what makes sense for your use case

1131
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,520
so say my reuse case was to see if there

1132
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,980
were hard-coded passwords or back doors

1133
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,480
in the UEFI

1134
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,300
so that's a question that s-bomb is not

1135
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,520
necessarily the right tool to answer if

1136
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,099
there are hard-coded passwords there are

1137
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:45,720
tools that you can use there's a lot of

1138
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,280
you know if you probably want to hire a

1139
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,760
team to test that but it's not it's

1140
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,780
something that you have to be clear

1141
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,579
about you know like you said what you're

1142
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:55,920
trying to get out of it and s-bomb's not

1143
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,960
necessarily the tool for that I'll add

1144
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,119
it would be worth talking to some of the

1145
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:02,880
tool vendors that part participated in

1146
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,160
the s-bomb challenge some of them have

1147
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,440
that capability outside of their strict

1148
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,260
s-bomb usage so it's a use case several

1149
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,880
of these vendors May support and it

1150
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,660
would be worth the question

1151
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:18,180
all right one more question if we have

1152
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,520
the time um my question is do we have

1153
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,980
information about the accuracy of the

1154
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,599
s-bombs that were generated and the

1155
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:26,160
accuracy of the vulnerabilities that

1156
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,180
were identified I don't really care if

1157
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,319
the vulnerabilities are actually

1158
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,240
exploitable but do we have like a good

1159
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,380
match

1160
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,800
that is the question that we really wish

1161
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,640
we could answer and can't so with the

1162
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,440
basically one day turnaround we had to

1163
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,839
do analysis for this challenge it was

1164
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:45,300
not feasible to make assertions about

1165
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,579
that with any sort of confidence we

1166
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:50,099
definitely looked at them but that's a

1167
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,220
question for future work I would want to

1168
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,920
have probably like at least like two

1169
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,200
months and have full access to all the

1170
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,119
tools be able to dig in do some manual

1171
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,380
validation

1172
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,020
have a team all that you know if I could

1173
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,280
have what I wanted that's what I think

1174
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,680
it would take

1175
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,819
all right okay

1176
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:12,440
Fair we'll talk to Zach

1177
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:18,980
