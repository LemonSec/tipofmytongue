1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,179
foreign

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:07,400
thank you

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,019
for the audience

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,940
let's start and learn about deception

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,520
oops yep so

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,859
people may tend to think the deception

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,580
is Honeypot and basically as is rely on

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,699
the basic idea behind honey pots it's

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,519
around 35 years old technology but

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,619
deception is basically took this

11
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,860
approach and make it to a platform

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,540
so let's start from the basic about

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,760
deception what is the meaning of

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,920
deception how deception is equal to our

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,360
real life

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,640
I guess everybody here took his kids to

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,800
a mirror maze and you know what's funny

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,780
about me or maze if you look on mirror

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,700
is from

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,579
above you can see a line of 25 meters

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,739
that you need to pass

22
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,780
if you go walking in the street 25

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,420
meters will take you half a minute

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,399
but if you take your kids into the

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,440
mirror message try to navigate

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,200
will take you at least 20 minutes and at

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,060
least two times you get your head in the

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,320
mirror

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,780
this is the idea behind deception

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,840
it's basically to take a real Network

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,900
Place fake asset fake device fake

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,100
application

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,280
the whole mission of the fake blanket

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,740
it's to get attacked by attacker

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,920
why because deception rely on a very

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,020
basic idea that nobody should touch

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,640
something fake

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,400
unless he had good reason to do it and

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,020
if you think about it

40
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,720
you will never open it though that

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,540
you're not aware they don't exist but if

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,159
you open this door

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,259
you do something that

44
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,079
against the policy so the idea behind

45
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,380
deception is to create illusion on the

46
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,439
network and basically

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,720
deceive the attacker to touch the wrong

48
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,659
asset versus the real asset

49
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,579
so let's try to understand what we try

50
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,939
to slow solve with deception

51
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,619
first

52
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,538
time to detect

53
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,280
and the mathematic here is very simple

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,000
if we spend more time on your network

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,420
the damage will be much bigger if you

56
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,000
detect it early in the kill chain

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,400
we reduce the damage so one of the

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
biggest problem of the industry and we

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,300
see it in the threat landscape for the

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,819
last 10 years that we try to reduce the

61
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,340
time to detect attacker there is many

62
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,800
analysts reports speaking about 200 days

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,560
100 Days end of the day we wake up in

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,319
the morning hearing about data breach

65
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,540
three weeks after the investigation we

66
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,640
discovered that these guys spend more

67
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,920
time on the network if we're willing to

68
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,800
detect attacker early we need to deceive

69
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,080
them early and this is what we try to do

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,640
with deception platform

71
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,560
and on this session we will learn how to

72
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,940
do it

73
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,920
the second time is the false positive

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,000
alert

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,760
this is one of the biggest problem of

76
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,160
the industry and I always describe it in

77
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,440
a mathematical way if you have five

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,000
analysts

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,760
in your soak and each one of them spent

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,500
two hours on a false alarm

81
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,900
meaning you pay for five Engineers you

82
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,599
get four because they spend 10 hours on

83
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,739
false alarm

84
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,040
with deception there is no chance

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,659
to spend

86
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,959
time on false alarm why because

87
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,180
go back again nobody should touch

88
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,980
something fake

89
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,959
if you think about it attackers that get

90
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,720
inside your network assuming assume that

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,819
you have 10 web servers but what if you

92
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,860
have 50 web servers

93
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,760
five FTP Service but what if you have 60

94
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,000
FTP Service the whole idea is to mimic

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,260
your environment

96
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,099
and make it 10x for the attacker so once

97
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,040
you get an alert you know that is a

98
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,980
relay because nobody should touch your

99
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,739
legit user contractor customer will

100
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,080
never touch fake asset because they're

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,720
not aware there is a fake asset

102
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
and the last one in the Otis space we

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,980
are dealing with networks that become

104
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,080
from airgap to Connected we are dealing

105
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,299
with devices that cannot protect

106
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,040
themselves cannot generate their own

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,918
Telemetry we're dealing with unpatched

108
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,680
devices and yes everybody here know that

109
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,080
you're still finding windows xp7 and Etc

110
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,120
inside your network

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,120
and you always have asset that I call

112
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,699
them problem of somebody else why

113
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:34,560
because you get devices from the vendors

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,139
of the OT but somebody else maintained

115
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,479
them and operate them so it's a problem

116
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,820
of somebody else but it's become your

117
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,040
problem

118
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,840
so as I mentioned deception is not

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,020
Honeypot Honeypot is a model inside the

120
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,199
platform Deception come from the idea of

121
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,320
let's take the network and split it to

122
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,979
four elements four silos

123
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,860
infrastructure endpoint and server data

124
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,479
and application

125
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,600
why because when threat act or penetrate

126
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,639
your network he always engage with one

127
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,620
of these silos he tried to move

128
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,139
laterally to keep engaging with more

129
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,300
so from deception perspective if we want

130
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,979
to detect the attacker early in the kill

131
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:17,820
chain

132
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,520
we will place deception on each one of

133
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,460
these silos we start with the decoy yes

134
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,919
it's a Honeypot by I call it Honeypot on

135
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,380
steroid not next gen why because it's

136
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,380
more scalable you get a long list of

137
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,840
inventory of decoys everything that you

138
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,080
have on iot iot and ID exist in

139
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,000
deception platform you can also build

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,039
your own decoy it's a new technology

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,360
that's coming

142
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,000
so if you look on the decoy today it's

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,160
not the Honeypot for 30 years ago it's

144
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,500
different it's more scalable place in

145
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,340
the cloud

146
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,280
OT iot and Etc the second layer is the

147
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,979
loo the services if you want to expand

148
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,740
the attack surface maximize your chance

149
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,479
to detect the attacker

150
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,960
take the services and make it 10x if you

151
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,800
have

152
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,639
five file server let's have 20. if you

153
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,060
have one sap system let's have three sap

154
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,680
or Erp system

155
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,400
this is basically try to deceive the

156
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,800
attacker the moment he land on the

157
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,639
network

158
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,440
the third element is the network

159
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,780
deception if you want to deal with

160
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,060
sophisticated attacker

161
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,979
this attacker always listen to the

162
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,860
traffic this attacker try to reroute the

163
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,120
traffic

164
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,160
try to pass traffic through the infected

165
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,740
machine in order to collect data you

166
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,319
want to attract them send them the

167
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,720
signal it's like a radio station

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,479
you get into your car you put the radio

169
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:47,000
station you're willing to hear the songs

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,340
this is exactly the purpose of network

171
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,120
deception sending to the wire single few

172
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,720
limited packets attacker willing to hear

173
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,460
and the last one

174
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,560
this is the last Innovation from

175
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,479
deception platform what we call

176
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,060
deception token breadcrumbs remember

177
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,479
attacker always land on a real asset

178
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,400
attacker Never Land from the internet on

179
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,919
a fake asset so the moment he land on

180
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,199
the real estate this is the moment we're

181
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,660
willing to deceive him so deception

182
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,780
token took the Honeypot technology to

183
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,240
deception platform into the prime time

184
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,060
by taking your real endpoint and server

185
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,120
the real one and convert them logically

186
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,660
to a hand to a decoy we basically Place

187
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,940
bread crumbs on the real endpoint and

188
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,580
server it's a fake keys to the Vault

189
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,300
fake credentials file application it's

190
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,039
an agentless technology it's not an

191
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,319
agent and basically when attack a

192
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,840
compromiser machine start collecting and

193
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,960
extracting data on the surface he will

194
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,539
get fake data it's always be attractive

195
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,720
he always get the direction go there and

196
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,240
if you go there he interact with a fake

197
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,860
asset

198
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,620
so how we do it

199
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,940
first

200
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,099
the deception when you plug it into your

201
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,139
network we need to interact with all the

202
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,599
network segments the idea is to cover

203
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,060
all your network villain and basically

204
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,360
the decoy just taking IP addresses that

205
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,720
nobody use think about it resource that

206
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,060
nobody use resource does not cost you

207
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,599
money basically you plug the software we

208
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,699
start Gathering addresses that nobody

209
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,000
use and we attach it to a decoys so on

210
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
every villain that you have X amount of

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,640
real asset you have y amount of fake

212
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,440
asset

213
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,500
once we finish to deploy the decoys we

214
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,200
get the topology of a fake Network the

215
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,600
system will start generating the keys

216
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,260
why because each fake Keys need fake

217
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,399
dough

218
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,560
so the system ensure that we create the

219
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,800
keys while the door are exist you cannot

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,120
do it before

221
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,120
once you deploy the deception token you

222
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
get one blanket on the endpoint and

223
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,820
server Network deception Services decoy

224
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,580
application and data think about it the

225
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,080
attacker get in

226
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,940
he never know what is the real what is

227
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,120
the fake we only need one time to touch

228
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,980
the fake

229
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,140
people tend to think the decoys and

230
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,600
deception need AI technology and Etc

231
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,100
machine learning nothing why because you

232
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,040
touch the decoy you shouldn't touch game

233
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,899
over it doesn't matter if it's a

234
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,880
malicious connection it's a legit

235
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,339
connection from attacker like Ping for

236
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,040
ETC for ETC for the decoy there is one

237
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,779
and zero you touch me alert you don't

238
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,279
touch me nothing happened

239
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,040
so once you engage with the decoy the

240
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,560
platform capture the whole engagement

241
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,500
analyze the engagement and generate

242
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,200
threat intelligence the idea behind

243
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,600
trade intelligence it's one to enrich

244
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,760
your threat analytics platform seems so

245
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,279
threat hunting and second

246
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,920
take the threat intelligence convert it

247
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,140
into mitigation response

248
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,540
deception platform utilize your

249
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,839
ecosystem in order to isolated or

250
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,180
quarantine the attacker out of the

251
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,580
network automatically

252
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,100
it's not just deceive and detect it's

253
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,440
not just forensics and analyze the data

254
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,320
we also mitigate it meaning we're

255
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,240
telling you that you have a problem but

256
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,320
we take care of the problem

257
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,660
so why to his deception in iot in OT

258
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,120
when I mentioned iot in terms of medical

259
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,839
iot many Healthcare adopt deception and

260
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,420
Audi critical infrastructure

261
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,279
and why people tend to use this

262
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,680
technology three main reasons there is

263
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,420
many of them behind me about three main

264
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,959
first it's non-intrusive zero impact on

265
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,560
your network second easy to install and

266
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,800
not require any network topology changes

267
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,140
nothing not inline configuration

268
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,040
shutdown plug the software start using

269
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,380
free address free IP address that nobody

270
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,560
use system is up and running and the

271
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,579
third one

272
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,160
there is no false alarm and false alarm

273
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,140
for all the team

274
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,480
that not all the time they are cyber

275
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,399
expert or not on the time they have the

276
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,339
time to deal with alerts to have a tool

277
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,440
that they know once they get an alert

278
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,899
Houston will have a problem

279
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,540
is a great Roi for them because they

280
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,860
know that they need to stop the

281
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,320
day-to-day operation and dealing with

282
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,000
the alert

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,500
and also it's not expensive

284
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,360
and if you look on Audi networks and you

285
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,800
want to understand how to detect

286
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,660
attackers with devices that you cannot

287
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,860
protect

288
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,680
think about attacker that get in and try

289
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,740
to find a PLC on a regular network with

290
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,980
20 plcs what happen if you have 200 plcs

291
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,260
from the attacker perspective it's

292
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,959
Heaven everything can be penetrated

293
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,720
everything is vulnerable he can have fun

294
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,060
and control everything but nobody tell

295
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,040
him that the moment he touched the wrong

296
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,540
asset this is the moment he go out

297
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,760
and how we do it with deception

298
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,420
it sounds like complicated maybe I'm not

299
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,660
mature maybe I'm not ready for deception

300
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,579
yes it was through six seven years ago

301
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,800
not today with all the virtualization

302
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Automation in place

303
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,820
a good deception tool

304
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,300
basically automate 85 from your

305
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,940
deployment first he profile the network

306
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,360
he running as a discovery he can do it

307
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,579
actively scanning in all it is a

308
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,560
Forbidden World and also do it by

309
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,000
passive

310
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,740
we know how to take the traffic and

311
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,839
build your asset Discovery the system

312
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,779
build your asset discovery

313
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,540
the system analyze your network and the

314
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,940
system by algorithm proposing what kind

315
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,820
of decoy to deploy you get a nice visual

316
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,700
map with all your network and all the

317
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,220
decoys any element to deploy

318
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,260
you can customize it you can agree

319
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,480
disagree you can manually fix the map

320
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,760
the deployment once you click the button

321
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,459
go grab a coffee cup of coffee 20 25

322
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,579
minutes system is up and running

323
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,980
you have the decoys we have the token

324
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,380
you integrate it with your platform

325
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,360
you just wait for the attacker to make

326
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,700
one mistake

327
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,200
you know

328
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,240
one of the things that's unique for

329
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,980
deception

330
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,019
it's the ability to detect the attacker

331
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,940
on the first mistake if you think about

332
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,100
attacker that move literally he can

333
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,920
touch your firewall your AV other

334
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,079
security but if it's not reaching the

335
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,380
anomaly signature or the threshold that

336
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,079
these devices will not send an alert

337
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,779
with deception it's different

338
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,820
you need to touch one time to get

339
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,579
detected there is no place for mistakes

340
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,800
with deception attacker without

341
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,620
deception can understand what AV what

342
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,500
firewall what proxy what other system

343
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,480
you have with deception

344
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,639
it's kind of a game over he touched the

345
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,279
wrong door get an alert getting out

346
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,620
and deception while adopting the ulti

347
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,880
market

348
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,779
and by the way 40 41 of our business in

349
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,760
deception is in the outer space just to

350
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,639
understand the value of the platform

351
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,700
let's look on the Purdue model and we

352
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,040
basically build the platform to support

353
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,500
the whole Purdue model on the control

354
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,880
Zone we will deploy decoy PLC Legacy

355
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,959
system

356
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,760
PLC should support all the biggest

357
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,800
vendor in in the industry plus the

358
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,699
protocols on the on the operation one we

359
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:50,899
will see scada HMI management platform

360
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,120
I.T because OT always have ID desktop in

361
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,740
the OT people need to work with the

362
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,720
headquarter even though that they are

363
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,820
placing on the OT side

364
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,339
then we go to the Enterprise deception

365
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,279
support ID not just OT you can deploy

366
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,180
servers application data camera switches

367
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,240
printers anything that you have on the

368
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,720
network in terms of ID iot and OT you

369
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,519
can find with deception solution you can

370
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,860
also build your own you can upload your

371
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,380
gold image and build your own decode

372
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,600
that will mimic your environment exactly

373
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,120
deception can be part of your domain can

374
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,639
be part of your tools

375
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,740
and the last one is the DMZ where you

376
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,279
can place deception in the DMZ however I

377
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,639
always recommend customer to place it in

378
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,459
the DMZ close to an asset that already

379
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,040
get exposed but don't expose the

380
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,260
Honeypot people get excited for exposing

381
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,959
Honeypot to the internet but once you do

382
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,839
it 90 90 of the alert is a white noise

383
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,300
because everybody scan everybody it's

384
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,800
not will not help you but if somebody

385
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,560
compromise the web server and around the

386
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,199
web server we have a lot of decoys guess

387
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,779
what once you compromise the web server

388
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,459
and try to look inside the segment

389
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,740
because you know in the DMZ he will walk

390
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,139
very slow and sensitive

391
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,720
once he touched the decoy it's a game

392
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,160
over for him he get out

393
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,880
now

394
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,440
let's see of the success of the

395
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,779
technology because take time I'm with

396
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,079
deception almost 12 feet I start in 2012

397
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:26,940
for Gardner was

398
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,519
hard to explain them and convince them

399
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,959
there is a technology for the Enterprise

400
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,240
so we was the first company in the

401
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,779
market so I saw the market from day one

402
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,459
and today when it's a bigger Market

403
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:41,759
let's look on a couple of case study

404
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,860
first this is by the way one of them

405
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,139
that I was personally involved as the

406
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,779
product it's a gas station company and

407
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,420
when I asked the ciso why gas station

408
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,420
need deception technology

409
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,519
he had a nice answer

410
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,160
he said look I was a ciso

411
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,860
of a different company

412
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,079
on my previous company the way to

413
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,359
penetrate me was between five to seven

414
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,819
entries to my network

415
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,160
now in the gas station business when I

416
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,740
have 335 gas station

417
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,160
I have 335 points to attack me

418
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,220
and gas station in covid-19 was the

419
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,619
business that was opened so this

420
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:25,079
business was grow because it was the one

421
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,699
of the few business that the government

422
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,439
allowed them to be open

423
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,480
so the business was grow

424
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,179
more application more data they start

425
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,280
collecting a lot of information

426
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,559
he was feel exposed

427
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,919
so the idea was to place deception

428
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,460
and detect the attacker on the gas

429
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,039
station itself why because if I detect

430
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,919
it early in the kitchen I just closed

431
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,039
the line for this gas station and he may

432
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,200
keep running there and when I contain it

433
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,900
or isolated but it will not affect my

434
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,120
the rest of my network because for one

435
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,580
gas station penetrate the data center

436
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,299
data center connect to 335 gas station

437
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,179
it's heaven for the attacker but if you

438
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,880
isolate the detect it on the gas station

439
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,400
level this is basically what you try to

440
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,260
achieve with deception so we place

441
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,840
deception on the gas station gas tank

442
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,600
camera printers Point of Sales

443
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,120
everything that gas station have we

444
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,340
place with deception

445
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,020
and the second one

446
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,179
it's a us-based customer is a water

447
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,280
company and the problem for the water

448
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,720
company

449
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,880
is a problem that we speak but we are

450
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,100
not aware that is exists if you are

451
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,200
manager water company and you are

452
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,840
dealing with the I.T and OT

453
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,179
where you spend your day protecting the

454
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:48,179
active directory or protecting the water

455
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,039
systems

456
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,080
the team every day have the challenge

457
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,480
what to do and they are stretching with

458
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,580
a lot of alerts false alarm system to

459
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,980
manage so they hear about deception and

460
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,039
the reason they go after deception was

461
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:05,460
not the decoyote and Etc it was nice

462
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,740
they want a tool for early Bridge

463
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,500
detection with zero Force positive they

464
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,419
don't have time to deal with everything

465
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,720
but they want to get a tool that one is

466
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,480
signaling an alert they now stop working

467
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,299
on the I.T go to the OT because it's a

468
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:22,080
problem

469
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,000
this was the reason for them to buy

470
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,700
deception

471
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,419
for use case for many use cases first

472
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,100
otiot and ID second ransomware we do

473
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,419
ransomware

474
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,940
without agent without machine learning

475
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,260
we are not EDR system why we just let

476
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,380
the ransomware encrypt fake files user

477
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,960
not encrypted fake files ransomware

478
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,299
encrypt when he encrypt the fake files

479
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,400
that placed on a decoy that act as a

480
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,580
file server we detect is a ransomware

481
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,700
so we detect 100 of the time ransomware

482
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,799
y because we're letting the ransomware

483
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,620
to do his mission to encrypt fire if he

484
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,480
encrypt fake we know that he's a

485
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,520
ransomware it cannot be a user

486
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,740
lateral movement is the classical one

487
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,020
and of course thread hunting

488
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,280
so why deception

489
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,020
if you want to know if there is somebody

490
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,760
in your network

491
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,700
already in the network use deception if

492
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,400
you have i t iot OT that cannot protect

493
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,919
themselves use deception it's not an

494
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,740
agent it's around them and protect them

495
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,440
and provide visibility and the last one

496
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,380
reducing false positive it's very

497
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,080
important false positive cost you money

498
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,600
buying deception reducing your false

499
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
positive save you money

500
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,340
q a

501
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,960
thank you

502
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,120
so you mentioned that like most likely

503
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,160
if an attacker gains access to the

504
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,380
environment will be on a real system

505
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,059
so you guys have an agent on the real

506
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,640
system correct no

507
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,620
there is two elements for deception

508
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,419
there is the decoys they are running

509
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:05,820
inside the software just taking IP

510
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,380
address from the network everything run

511
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,419
in the software but the IPS from the

512
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,760
segment when you scan the segment the

513
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,679
decoy answer like a real system this is

514
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,080
one level the second level is the

515
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,000
deception token we take the breadcrumbs

516
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,820
the agent list it's a script that we run

517
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,039
on the real endpoint and server and we

518
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,500
are placing secret that the attacker

519
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,140
wants a compromise and get exposed he

520
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,780
just follow it we just inject like fake

521
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,539
credentials fake shortcut to application

522
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:35,400
we hide it from the user the user don't

523
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,260
see it you need hacking tools to see it

524
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,000
we inject it into the operating system

525
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,980
so once you get exposed to effect

526
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,260
credentials with a destination for

527
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,380
example we inject user password for RDP

528
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,780
session to a server you run a mimikat

529
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,940
Store password you extract the user

530
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,919
password with the IP he accessed the

531
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:55,679
server login fine it's a decoy he keep

532
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,960
playing with the asset not aware that is

533
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,500
a fake we keep capturing the data

534
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,940
alerting and mitigate it out from the

535
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,039
network so so you're assuming that he's

536
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,380
going that the attacker is going to

537
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,960
focus on what the red bread crumbs you

538
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,820
leave like to me an attacker first thing

539
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,539
they're going to do is they're going to

540
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,220
do some enumeration they might try to

541
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,480
figure out what systems maybe they want

542
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,799
to go after domain controllers or

543
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,220
specific systems but your product's not

544
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,200
going to give them because there's

545
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,700
multiple products out there for

546
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,380
deception so your product's not going to

547
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,260
give them misleading names for systems

548
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,320
it's just going to leave breadcrumbs

549
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,120
um with uh

550
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,340
in the hopes or the design that the

551
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,840
attacker will find those breadcrumbs

552
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,520
first before they find other legitimate

553
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,000
systems

554
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,400
making a motion on an endpoint he will

555
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,280
expose real data from the user and fake

556
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,380
data fake data will always be more

557
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,480
attractive for him he may not use it in

558
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,640
the beginning and in a later phase but

559
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,820
he know that he has credentials access

560
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,840
interesting application to go after

561
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,000
think about it one of the breadcrumbs

562
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,020
very simple very brilliant we place fake

563
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,679
network drive share that map to a decoy

564
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,659
but we hide the network drive from the

565
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,039
user when the user click my computer

566
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,539
they will not see the network drive just

567
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:14,640
on command line when attacker compromise

568
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,159
your desktop running in the background

569
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,320
you go after local Drive network drive

570
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,780
the moment you touch the fake you get an

571
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,880
alert without do nothing just you know

572
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,100
enamorate the desktop we will get the

573
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,780
First Alert this is how we detect by the

574
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,340
way around somewhere so there is

575
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,460
deception token you just need to touch

576
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,799
get alert or you need to execute the

577
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,260
data that you get so two different but

578
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,059
all of them in one package it's a script

579
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,460
running and disappear it's not an agent

580
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,679
okay so then your your system needs

581
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,299
credentials to be able to get into that

582
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,520
system over the network to drop the it's

583
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,260
a script that you put in the logon

584
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,720
script it utilize the user it's a user

585
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,059
space not admin we're running insert it

586
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,400
in the user level so once the attacker

587
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,960
can run it you see it from the user and

588
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,640
also can place in the admin it's depend

589
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,559
on the permission but the default and

590
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,000
the user level you don't need admin

591
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,100
access and you just place this place it

592
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,960
in active directory logon script is the

593
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,460
best way to do it there is many way but

594
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,100
this is the most reliable one okay thank

595
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,280
you

596
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,080
thank you so much for the presentation

597
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,460
how do you differentiate between the

598
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,799
decoy and the real one I mean if you

599
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
have an asset information asset

600
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,179
inventory system or a health monitoring

601
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,799
system or something how do you

602
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,299
differentiate on the two yeah it's a

603
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,740
good question we have we have a

604
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,179
mechanism in the platform that's called

605
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:35,820
safe list during that installation you

606
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,799
discover tools that monitor the network

607
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,900
monitoring tool vulnerability scanner

608
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,419
and Etc you take their behavior and put

609
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,100
it in the safe list meaning you let the

610
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,440
system know that if you get engagement

611
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,020
from this AP on this service ignore it

612
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,120
not alert and you also can block from

613
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,460
him the answer so if not map you in

614
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,320
their Network so you don't see that you

615
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,400
don't want to see the decoy on the

616
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,960
monitoring tool and you don't want to

617
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,820
see the decoy vulnerable on your

618
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,440
reporting on the vulnerability scanner

619
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,480
so we know how to ignore it and not even

620
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,940
be visible on their side that means

621
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,860
there's a kind of a master where you

622
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,400
know if it's a decoy or no I configured

623
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,440
in my side so if the monitoring tool

624
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,720
touch it I am not alerting I ignore it

625
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,880
and I also can block this connection and

626
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,860
say even not fingerprint it in your

627
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,539
system so you don't want to have like a

628
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,779
hpov and see your real network with many

629
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,059
many other assets at your networking

630
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,620
like what's happened like we get like

631
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,559
500 more assets today so it's working

632
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,240
both Direction

633
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,080
thank you

634
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,659
all right as Security Professionals I

635
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,640
think it's easy to say we get the value

636
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,960
proposition of this but I'm going to

637
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,580
tell you in real life we have to deal

638
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,320
with operations managers who don't want

639
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,880
us dropping anything in an environment

640
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,520
that they don't understand

641
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,140
so how do you

642
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,720
um recommend those of us who are trying

643
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,240
to educate our Business Leaders

644
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,039
especially our operations Business

645
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,220
Leaders that it's safe to put something

646
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,740
like this in their environment and it's

647
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,659
not going to cause

648
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,299
I can give you many many recommendations

649
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,760
but I will choose the one that always

650
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,580
work wait for the annual penetration

651
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,919
test that you need to do every year ask

652
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,659
them to put deception as a proof of

653
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,820
concept before the penetration test and

654
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,679
let us see the value how we detect the

655
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,200
penetration tester team early in the

656
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,419
kitchen it's always work we always sell

657
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,299
deception if the customer have a annual

658
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:32,640
penetration test several weeks before

659
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,100
deployed and let it run this is the best

660
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,659
proof you can have

661
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,940
I I think we have time for one more

662
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,360
question so go ahead so one of the

663
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,600
issues in OT honeypots is creating a

664
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,020
degree of realism so you can set up some

665
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,940
scada software or PLC or whatever and

666
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,159
emulate it but if it's not filled with

667
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:54,480
the right kind of points and the right

668
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,760
kind of connections you don't get that

669
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,100
prolonged attack or dwell time that you

670
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,779
might need to observe them deploy their

671
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,419
ttps to a later stage how do you guys

672
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,480
take care of that yes so

673
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,059
we have two kind of OT decoys there is

674
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,820
the emulation engine and soon we are

675
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,140
going to come with a full operating

676
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,120
system engine it's too different so on

677
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,120
the emulation part we basically create

678
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,400
an asset the look and feel it's like a

679
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,860
real PLC but it's not running the actual

680
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,620
OS the next gen of it this year we will

681
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,140
allow you to upload like a Rockwell

682
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,320
firmware and run it as a real asset we

683
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,179
take control of the networking that the

684
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:35,520
PLC should send we take control on the

685
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,679
Mac address we take control on the web

686
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,340
UI we teach the emulation to answer like

687
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,860
the attacker expect and and again I

688
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,720
always tell people you don't want to

689
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,700
have your OT as a cyber range only

690
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,559
things you need the moment you touch

691
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,779
jump and take it out you don't want to

692
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:55,559
let attacker 20 30 10 one hour in an old

693
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,140
environment to play because okay he will

694
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,659
play nice not nice he will move on you

695
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:02,159
don't want to let him move laterally you

696
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,700
want him one time touch take out so it

697
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,700
shouldn't be like 100 you need one

698
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,340
mistake remember even a ping or even

699
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,200
layer 2 attacks we know how to detect we

700
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,000
have an IPS engine in the platform so

701
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,559
even if you run many in the middle

702
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,179
respond there all these attacks that

703
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,159
under the hood we know how to detect it

704
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,299
because we're looking on the network

705
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,740
stack

706
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,900
right thank you

707
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,320
and remember if you cannot beat them at

708
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,720
least deceive them thank you

709
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,720
foreign
